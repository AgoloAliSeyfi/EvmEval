#1	AnnotatorNotes E3	Is it a Pesonnel.Elect event when a party wins an election? Then the party decides who is the PERSON argument of a START-POSITION event?
A5	Questionable E2 Mention
#2	AnnotatorNotes E2	This isn't actually a winning of an election by a candidate who was actually on the ballot. Sistani is a party leader, he wasn't a candidate. Is it still a Personnel.Elect event?
