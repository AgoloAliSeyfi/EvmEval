We will probably have cases like the followinig, which will make it inconsistent to get the correct token, currently I will make a guess, but I hope annotations does not have that problem (events should always cover tokens)

Token:
1199 trips/vacations/whatever 5479 5503

Gold:
T28     Transport-Person 5479 5484      trips
T30 	Transport-Person 5485 5494		vacations
