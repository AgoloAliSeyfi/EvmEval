@OmSigDAVID,

All livestock may be chattel, but not all chattel are livestock. I've provided you the example of women and children as chattel, whether or not you want to acknowledge it. Shouting and indulging hysterics won't do anything to support your feeble argument.

I don't care what you believe. In fact, in the 18th century, the Dutch were the biggests slave traders, with the New England merchants a close second behind them. Your ignorance does not serve as a refutation of what i write.

That does not alter the fact that thay were deemed livestock, bought, sold and rented as such. That was the sense of the situation, the spirit of the times. I thought everyone knew that.

Everyone doesn't know it because it's not true. You continue to ignore the issue of blacks in states without an institution of slavery. Do you allege that they were "livestock" as well?

Colonial American women's rights were restricted by the patriarchal view of English Common Law. As in England, women were viewed as chattel and had no individual legal rights.

The most interesting and disturbing aspect of chattel law is the notion of women as chattel that has woven itself into legal codes throughout history. In various times, places and cultures such as Merry Old England, the Hebrew Bible, The Code of Hammurabi and the Middle East, a bride price was/is an amount of money or property paid by the groom to the parents of his bride, she thus becoming his possession like a horse, a wagon or household utensils. Its origins were before recorded history and it established the wife as property, or, chattel. That practice established the world-wide dominion over women by men. Most European noblewomen were joined to their husbands in chattel marriages. In the patriarchal society of Old New York, women were treated as chattel and only valued as objects. For many men a wife still remains his chattel, in theory.

Historically, under common law, damages could be awarded to a husband on the loss of his wife due to the actions of another because his wife was considered chattel. In certain Middle Eastern societies, women (and women in some Orthodox Jewish cultures) are still considered chattel having no legal existence outside their husbands, fathers, sons and brothers. A husband owns his wife and any children of the marriage. In some areas, that chattel status is modified to only include sexual and reproductive rights that are owned by husbands.

For someone who claims to a lawyer, you are breathtakingly ignorant.

Most American treated married women according to the concept of coverture, a concept inherited from English common law. Under the doctrine of coverture, a woman was legally considered the chattel of her husband, his possession. Any property she might hold before her marriage became her husband's on her wedding day, and she had no legal right to appear in court, to sign contracts or to do business. Although these formal provisions of the law were sometimes ignored—the wives of tradesmen, for example, might assist in runing the family business—married women technically had almost no legal identity.

I've not read all of the thread and apologise if this has already been mentioned, but the sweet tooth in America is stronger than over here. I hope I don't sound smug, because obesity is beginning to be quite a problem over here as well.

Manufacturers of processed food tend to sell more if they include salt and sugar, this affects our relationship with unprocessed food. In the same way that a strawberry, that ordinarily tastes sweet, tastes sour after eating a bar of chocolate, unprocessed food seems less tasty after a diet of processed food.

Jamie Oliver recently did some food programmes in the Deep South, broadcast over here. He made a barbecue sauce that tasted just right to him, but his American friends felt it wasn't sweet enough. I recently made a buttermilk pie from a texan cookbook. I put in half as much sugar as the recipe suggested, but I still found it too sweet. I then used a quarter as much, and it was about right.

Kelloggs cornflakes are sweeter in America than in the UK. I like them over here, but not when in America. I think that the overall levels of sugar in ordinary non- dessert foods is more of a problem than kids eating too many sweets.

@Setanta,

In 2001 the state of New Mexico did place a 3-year old girl in state custody on grounds of morbid obesity, but a judge later returned her to the parents:

...Anamarie... weighed 67 pounds at 16 months, 97 pounds at 28 months, and 130 pounds by July of 2000, when she was... three years old.....What Anamarie’s mother didn’t know was that the state’s Child, Youth and Families Department was already preparing an affidavit that would accuse her and her husband, Miguel Regino, of endangering their child’s life by making her fat.
