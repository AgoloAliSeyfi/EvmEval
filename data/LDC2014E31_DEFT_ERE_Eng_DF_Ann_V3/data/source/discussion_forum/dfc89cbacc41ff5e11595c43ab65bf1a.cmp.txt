You have to think about this one a little more Willow. The president is on air 24/7, so... unless you want him to laugh at pre-approved jokes then what you are asking is impossible, it was a casual dinner, not some huge world wide press conference, what other time would be appropriate, and even then, would you actually think that a spontaneous laugh can be "delayed"? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

You didn't approve of the joke "I wish he had kidney failure"... so, the joke was not pre-approved.

Hmm... so now you are contending that humor is not spontaneous.

Of course not. You aren't saying anything, just busy dodging the issue because you can't bear to condemn your loved Ann Coulter.

By the way, Wanda Sykes isn't the president either.

</quote>

no,, but the guy who laughed at her guttertalk did.

</quote>

Ann Coulter did a lot more than laugh. And yet no response from you. I am shocked, shocked I tell you, to learn of your hypocrisy <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

you're missing the point...

should the president go out and say

i think we should nuke iran...

don't buy microsoft stock....

its called responsibility of office and position kittenkoder, if you don't know what this about, i suggest you look it up. his words and actions are not taken as if you and i said them. seriously, give it a rest.

Ann Coulter didn't laugh. She said that someone should MURDER a sitting USSC justice. And you are excusing it cause shes "not the president". Obama never said anything about Limbaugh, despite the massive amount of shit Limbaugh has thrown at Obama.
