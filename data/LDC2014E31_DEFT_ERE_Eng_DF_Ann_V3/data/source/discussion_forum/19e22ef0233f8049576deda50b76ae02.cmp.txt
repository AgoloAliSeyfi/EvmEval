Why did 2 of the most senior police officers in the country resign then?

Cameron can try and deflect all the flak he wants by blaming everyone else but media execs have resigned, police officers have resigned, that leaves only the ministers who are elected to represent themselves their constituents.

The fact of the matter is that Cameron has handled the whole thing terribly, even being shown up at times by the awful Milliband. I'm not saying he should go but it's not something we should so lightly dismiss.

More expendable imo "Dave". It's not about right, Newscorp is the same. Both Murdoch's are still in their jobs while others around them have resigned. Look at the potential implication of somebody like Cameron going, it would bring about market uncertaintly for starters as nobody knows whether it would trigger another election.

More uncertainty than not knowing what might be uncovered and when???

My response to the point about Both Murdoch's still having a job, that's a job at their own company... bit different to a civil servant IMHO..

Can someone please tell me if the inteligence services can call a closed meeting of the house of commons to present evidence they may feel is in the national Interest, to all of the house?? Say for example if they knew a PM and the party in power were in the pocket of a large media empire and knew they helped to keep their activities from becoming public and knew they were meeting with the PM and the other politicians to shape the policies. Knew the media giant had a culture of law breaking and the power to ruin politicians that stood up to them.. You know that kind of threat to the fabric of the UK...

Could the inteligence services provide this proof to the house to ensure action was taken? Or would they simply have to report to those involved and sit on their hands while they do nothing??

I'm not sure, but I believe the report would be shown to the Cabinet Secretary, who would approach the PM and let him know his position wasn't tenable.

Or something.

Cheers Steve, that's interesting, if true then they could be effectively gagged if wanted. ie. his position could still be tenable, despite the evidence. <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/confused.gif"/>

Uncertainty about what exactly, I'm not a celebrity, unlikely to know anyone personally who's had their phone hacked. Uncertainty in my life is knowing how a utility bills going to get paid currently, how I'll make ends meet this month. It's a luxury worrying about this type of stuff for some in soceity currently.

But I'll level with you, if knowing to much resulted in a change of administration in this country, an economic situation worsening and me being worse off. Perhaps I'd sooner we didn't know anymore.

I meant there seems to be a lot of uncertainty in NI, the Police force and the politicians as exactly what happened, who did what and what else there is proof of that has not yet been made public. My uncertainty stems from the uncertainty expressed by all these people. I would have thought that the UK market would be suffering from a certain degree of uncertainty also about all these issue. Not to mention the EU financial crisis etc, so any possible change of PM or general election would perhaps have a limited effect due to the current uncertainty.. ??

I agree with you to a point that it might be better not to know etc... but I don't think we have any control over that.

This all seems like something out of a novel to me, who would have thought we would see what we have in recent weeks, and have the relevations we have. Who'd have thought there would be a strong connection between NI, the Met Police and the UK government. <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/> <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

Makes me wonder about the moon landings you know! Another case of Media and government connections maybe? <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/diablotin.gif"/>
