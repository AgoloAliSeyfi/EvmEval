Hi,

<quote orig_author="Good bloke">
Where is the double standard? Iran is a voluntary signatory to a treaty that commits it to not develop nuclear weapons.

Double standards by the West.

Hmm. Saddam Hussein fought the Iranians for many years and achieved a stalemate. He promised the mother of all battles when he invaded Kuwaitn 1991. He was wrong, and was defeated in days and even failed to inflict as many casualties on the allies as they would have sustained in equivalent training exercises. I don't think Iran will be able to prevent the Israelis from destroying their facilities, bearing in mind Iran will receive no help from the Arabs.

Iran just had a revolution at the time 1979, and Iraq invaded Iran in 1980. At the time Iran was obviously weak in the sense that it was still trying to be reorganise and rebuild itself after the revolution. (lets be honest, every revolution takes a counrty back by decades) The fact that Iran was able to regain all of the land which was invaded by Iraq is quite impressive as most countries were supporting Iraq. Furthermore, USA gave Iraq chemical weapons, which had a devastaing affect on Iran and escalated the issue. (search it up, very interesting)

Yes I agree, majority/all of the Arab countries wont support Iran for the main reason which is that they are so dependent on the US and its allies (dont want to get to involved into that aspect, very long).

But it has been 30 years and Iran as reinvested in its military and missile technology. Lets not forget the 30 day war between Israel and Hezbollah of Lebenon. The mighty "Israel" had difficulty with Hezbollah, a gureilla group supported and partially funded by Iran and Hezb rely 100% on Iranian missiles.

My point is, current Iran is not comparable to the likes of former Saddam's Iraq and Syria. Iran has evolved since 30 years ago. Although yes, Israel IS stronger than Iran however the retaliation that it face would be too costly for them. Israel is the size of Wales (roughly) they wont be able to cope with the number of missile deployed by Iran in retaliation even with their missile defence systems. Not forgetting, SHAHAB-3 missile which are in range of Israel and Iranian copy of the S-300 defence systems surrounding the sites.

Which treaties have been broken in the last thirty years? And why shouldn't Iran meet its treaty obligations?

Iran will not be able to sustain a war against Israel. It does not have the capability of projecting its military strength by sea and doesn't have sufficient missiles to trouble Israel for long (quite apart from the fact that overflying Arab air space will invite trouble from another source).
