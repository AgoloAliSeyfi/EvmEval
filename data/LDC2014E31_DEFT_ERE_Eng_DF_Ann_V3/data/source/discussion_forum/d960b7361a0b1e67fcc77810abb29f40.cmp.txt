First off, anyone that can't see through the speech as a method for gaining short term support in the local elections is a retard.

Second, this tread seems to be devoid of facts regarding benefits:

EU immigrants have to have worked in the UK for 12 months before they are allowed to claim anything.

Non-EU immigrants cannot claim anything for 5 years until they can apply for residency.

As for those who claim there is an undue strain on public services, guess how these services are paid for? That's right, taxes! Taxes which are paid as immigrants need work to work to live in the UK.

Then comes the question of why are immigrant workers considered more employable than local workers? Also, is there a credible source for this 70% statistic being thrown around?

Finally, it is not racist to be 'anti-immigration'. It is racist if you are selective of who you allow to immigrate based on their race. Hardly any of you would bat an eyelid if there was a family migrating from the USA, but would kick up a ****storm if there was a family migrating from Poland.

Blimey, talking about wanting to have your cake and eat it!

You sir are a hypocrite and no amount of blather can disguise that fact, no matter how erudite.

Nice to see you ignoring the relevant bit about it being impossible for people to immigrate to the UK and go 'straight onto benefits', you know the bit in my post that countered your earlier remark about people turning up in the UK to go onto benefits, you know, showing it to be no more than ignorant *******s.

'A family from the USA and a family from Poland are immigrating to the UK, who would you let in?'

Ask this question to as many so called 'anti-immigration' supporters as you like. You will not be surprised by the answers.

For the simple fact that you have announced yourself as a descendant of Immigrants, yet you voice concern over the state of the current Immigration policies.

Do you not think that the same concerns were raised during your grandparents times and duly ignored by the government in the same way as now? Perhaps you will argue that it is all a matter of "degree" but we are talking semantics there really, arent we.

Nigel Farage: Too many Eastern Europeans have entered Britain. If that isn't ****ing racist, I don't know what is.

Cameron has pretty much slagged off every hard working immigrant that has entered the UK. Whatever happened to his black friend who joined the navy after getting fed up with primary school? Obviously the big C has decided to disregard his ancestry, despite their offspring being so committed to the UK that they gave up years of education to join the Navy. Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb why did he ever open his mouth dumb.

your first comment is not racist in any way, he just says too many have entered, if 1 billion immigrants came here from all over the world within a matter of weeks, and i said "too many are coming", then how the **** is that racist? its pure fact, just shut up you PC ****.

Yes, and there you lose the supposed moral highground by making ill founded judgements about people whom you know nothing about.

You're "relevant" bit about benefits is not valid either because there are myriad forms of help, financial and otherwise which immigrants are immediately entitled to according to our glorious leaders.

just because you single out a race does not make someone racist, if a Scottish person said too many English are coming here, no one would batter an eye lid. So you think its a lie? how can someone's opinion be a lie?

To some people 1 person would be too many, to others a million would be too many. you cannot call an opinion a lie.
