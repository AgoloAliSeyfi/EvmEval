America didn't offer significant help in the Falklands war, certainly nothing like the scale of the British assistance in the war on terror, and in our own war on terror agaisnt IRA etc, America's intervention was almost non-existant.

Considering that our economy has never been better (thanks to the labour party) change, in a broad sense, is no longer a major issue which is why Labour are losing votes. In my oppinion the only reason the Conservative party are starting to give labour a fight for their money is because of the rocky couple of years they've had, with Blair being seen as kissing Bush's arse (i would have done the same thing in that position, if we were to go to war we'd expect America to be by our side, so to keep our strongest allie we had to support and join them in war). Gordon Browns 10p tax reduction has basically isolated his main support which was coming from the working class who would most benefit from the 10p tax and also the road tax and charging people for having a 4x4 in the city (deservidly, whats the point in having a 4x4 in a city, impractical and a waste of petrol imo) so he has also isolated the middle class who don't want to have to pay extra tax for their car.

I don't think the sudden shift has much to do with the conservatives policies but more to do with Labours slight 'mistakes' over the past 2-3 years. Still the mistakes the Labour party have made recently are nothing in comparison to the mistakes the conservatives made the last time they were in power.

""Slight" mistakes"? Brown is hammering the very people he's supposedly protecting. The 10p tax rate, the stealth tax on the 4x4's that's slipped by unnoticed, the promised referendum that was never delivered to name a few. The sooner we get rid of Brown and the Labour party the better.

True, the shift has come about as the Tories have realised they need to reform (although have chosen a PR ready clown (as much as Blair was) to erode much of the identity of the Tories - see the Conservative party logo?

But most of it comes down to people are fed up of the government. It happens when governments have been in power for so long, even to the best of them. Yes, Labour almost annihalated the Tories in 1997 and came into power on a wave of optimism and they haven't fully delievered.

It doesn't really matter what the Tories stand for. So long as they say the right things the people will come back.

Quite the opposite in fact. They actively raised money for the IRA.

The Parliamentary Conservative and Labour parties in my opinion both sit on the centre right of the political spectrum.

Their local parties are center right and centre left respectively.

They both aim to deliver their policies in a Blairite fashion, involving spin. This is what confuses many people to believe that their policies aren't very different when in fact they are.

When you delve into the Conservative spin, you will find that they are the same old Thatcherite New Right party.

When you delve into the New Labour spin, you will find that they follow the centrist Third Way agenda.

It's not and hasn't been the case for the majority of most posters' lifetimes.

The offered some support in the Falklands to be fair, all that was really required. Your true about the IRA though, many Irish Americans actually sympathised with the IRA (some not eve being fully aware of its actions and history) and gave money to the cause.
