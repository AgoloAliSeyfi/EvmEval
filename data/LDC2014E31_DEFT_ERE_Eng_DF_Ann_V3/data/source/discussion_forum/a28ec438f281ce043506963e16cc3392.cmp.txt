Not going to bother with the Libya stuff, thats a different thread and a different argument. Apart from the Putin bit. Its pretty clear he was just point scoring. Had he cared he would have vetoed the UN resolution on Libya.

BRIC is not set up to rival NATO. The name BRIC was created by an Goldman Sachs economist awhile back, its an informal association. The countries have their summits occasional but it is nothing like NATO. NATO is an military organisation centred around a combined defence policy and military command and control integration of its members.

China does not give a damn for Iran, they have supported sanctions and are currently lowing their oil imports from Iran, hardly the actions of a country willing to challenge the West over the issue. Not that China can anyway. Their military cannot take on the West and currently has no projection power ( set to change in the next decade and fast but not yet).

And what super jet would that be? The JF 17, 50 of which that China sent over recently? If thats meant to be a super jet then God only knows what something like the F22 must be.

Source for the Nuclear armed destroyer? Even if it is true whats the relevance? The US aren't about to nuke Syria.

Not even going to bother crediting the CIA death squad claim with a response.

Hmmm. I think China wouldn't mind the USA getting bogged down in Iran for the next 10 years! Such involvement in Iran would deny US the ability to increase its presence in the Asia Pacific where it wishes to counter the increasing Chinese efforts. China knows that the Strait of Hormuz will not be closed for a long time in case of such a war. It will also just replace Iranian oil with supplies from elsewhere.

I believe Oil does have apart to play in it- yes there might be sanctions- but countries still buy their oil! If it's cheap, a blind eye tends to be turned. I can't think for another reason for not kicking out diplomats like Assad's wife (she's not ignorant as she might claim she was at one of his rallies yesterday it was in the newspapers)

A possible reason for no intervention in Syria, is that the Syrians have a fairly massive, modern army (Bigger and better than Libya by some scale)

Only 2% of the worlds oil might come from Syria- that's still millions if not billions of Â£'s worth!!

Why is the United Kingdom allowing Asma Assad and her three children to remain in the UK?

<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/8503481/Is-Asma-Assad-in-London.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worl...in-London.html</a>

<a href="http://mideastparalleluniverse.blogspot.com/2011/05/asma-al-assad-escapes-to-london.html">http://mideastparalleluniverse.blogs...to-london.html</a>

I know she was born and raised in London, but do you think that the UK is as anti-Assad as it claims?

The UK is not Anti-Assad. Israel is anti-assad, and as a result, America is, so the Uk jumped on America's band wagon to make itself ' look good', mainly after the VETO decision. Seeing as there is no real proof that Assad is doing anything wrong, and there is proof that mercenaries / terrorists have been funded by America, i tend not to believe the repeated videos, of which i could easily replicate myself with a decent videocamera and some free software.
