My Mam has been staying with us (hubby and I) all over Christmas and New year, she was here a month (22 Dec - 19th Jan) and has returned back to Wales in the past few days.

A few weeks ago I decided that next weekend as hubby isnt working (he had to work today) we should spend some time together alone just him and me as its been a while since we had a chance. I asked / reminded him yesterday to not arrange anything between the Friday lunchtime when he finished work to the Monday morning when he returned. All he could say in a huffy way was "if I have to, as it keeps you happy yes!". <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/frown.gif"/>

Then a bit earlier today he came to me and said he was "just going into our garage to get the bits he needs to service his van ready as he now has to do it tomorrow as he isnt allowed to do anything next weekend as I want him to take it off so we can be together!" he wasnt very happy and stormed off in a huff again. <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/frown.gif"/> I dont suppose I helped when I shouted "it takes 2 to work at a relationship" as he walked away.

He doesnt seem to realise or maybe he just doesnt care how it makes me feel. We seem to be the only couple on the planet who cant spend time together, we hardly ever go out anywhere, he never takes me anywhere for a nice dinner, cinema, evening out, walk along the beach, a romantic last minute weekend in a cheap hotel etc.If I suggest it I get the same response. When we do its because he wants to do it / go there (usualy as his mates are there), or his mother pays (so I get a day out in the summer or for valentines day, anniversary, birthday etc) or I have to fork out for the day. If he gets me a present its something stupid which I wouldnt want ever (last one was a quad motorbike as he thought I could learn to drive it and it would get me out and about, its a non starter and needs loads of work and he paid for this !!!!). He doesnt buy me any little surprise gifts etc. We have been married over 11 years now and it seems most of that time its been a 1 way effort. Infact he is usualy on his laptop infront of the tv and I am on mine in the conservatry (if not next to him on the sofa), he just doesnt want to sit and watch tv with me cuddled up on the sofa or an early night with the tv in the bedroom even!

We dont have children, just 2 dogs which MIL is always happy to have for a few nights or pop in to feed and let out for a day.

He is self employed and always claims he never has any money spare, but I know he has, I cant say he is rolling in it but I know he has enough to throw away every now and then as he gets himself all sorts of stupid stuff which usualy doesnt work and sits in the garage waiting to be repaired and sold on.

Sorry to moan but I really feel down now and dont know what to do or say. We havent spoken since before dinner. Am wondering weather to sleep in the spare bedroom tonight! <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/redface.gif"/>

He just doesnt get it. <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/frown.gif"/>

I think it can be very easy to focus on what he doesn't do. My DH is the same, sometimes, we have a toddler and on a rare moment alone he can seem really unenthusiastic to make an effort for romance. But he does loads for us in other ways that shows he cares and loves us all.

Dont get me wrong its not that I dont appreciate what he does do, I certainly do and always make him aware of it but again he never bothers for me just expects it!

Excuse me, but you've had your Mum staying for bloomin ages, I'm not surprised he's got the hump, what if he wanted to spend some nice time with you during that period.
Your choice obviously on how you choose to feel about this but if I'd had my mother in law here for a month I can tell you I wouldn't be a happy bunny.
