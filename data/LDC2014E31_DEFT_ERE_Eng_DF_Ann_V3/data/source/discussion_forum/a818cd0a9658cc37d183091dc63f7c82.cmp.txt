Okay heres what happened yesterday. Im not sure if I did the right thing, or whether the majority of posters on here will approve, but whats done is done and I will now have to see what happens next.

I was with him for about 10 hours, we chatted, had a few beers, food, and walked for miles. The conversation that I had with him lasted around 30-45 minutes as I did not want to spoil the whole day by going round in circles talking about it, nor did I see any benefit to labouring the point once Id said what I wanted to say.

I told him that I was feeling unsatisfied with the relationship as it stands and that although I do love him, it is no longer enough for me, and while I fully understood the situation he is in, he needs to make a decision one way or another as to whether we have a future together on a more permanent basis. I have asked him to seriously think about this before the next time we meet (and depending on what he has to say, I will decide to hang in there or walk away) He is due to go away on his holidays shortly afterwards so I think that if the decision is to end things, it will be easier to stick to knowing that it will be very difficult to contact each other for several weeks.

I know this probably wasnt what some people hoped would happen, but I didnt want to put him on the spot to try and get an immediate answer.

You are giving him entirely too much power by letting him make the decisions. You're only 42, do you really want to waste any more of your life on someone that can't give you 100%?

Then you only know of her and what she's like through her husband, who could be saying anything for the sake of it?

Which is what most guys say when they want a bit of attention from another woman.

If I were in your shoes back then, before anything had happened, my advice would have been to have left his wife, so that they both could have had a chance of happiness with someone else. <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/cool.gif"/>

No which is why I had the conversation with him yesterday - if he decides he's not going to make a commitment, then I will be deciding to walk away.

I fully agree that in an ideal world this would happen, however people do stay in relationships for a variety of reasons

I doubt he'll give you any more time than he has done for the last 2 1/2 years. His lies to his wife about where he is and who he's with every 2 - 3 weeks might have kept him in the clear so far but absences happening more frequently than that will take a lot more lying on his part.
What lie does he tell you he usually tells her when he goes awol?
