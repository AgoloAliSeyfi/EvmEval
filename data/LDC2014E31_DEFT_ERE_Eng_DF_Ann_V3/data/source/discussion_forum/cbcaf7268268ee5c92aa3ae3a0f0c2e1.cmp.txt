Actually I kinda like your thinking LGS. I don't like paying for branded stuff that everyone else buys. Although I have to say that watch doesn't do it for me style-wise, finding and owning a watch made by Navaho indians says a lot more about a person than a mainstream designer brand.

Here's another nice but 'non poncey' watch for you to consider...

My girlfriend hates designer label stuff, and is pretty down to earth and practical. However she also has expensive skin... A nickel allergy means she can't wear regular steel, silver or leather - even if it's just the clasp. So, that means 24 carat gold, platinum or titanium! <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/eek.gif"/>

So, I ended up getting her one of these -

<a href="http://www.skagen.co.uk/index.php?SCREEN=scrListProductItem&amp;nProdID=3813&amp;nCategoryID=40">233XSTTM</a>

Titanium and hypo-allergenic steel. Gunmetal coloured (so not girly), pretty much indestructible and doesn't bring her out in a horrible rash <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/thumbsup.gif"/>

I still stick with my faithful plastic Casio <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>. This one is now on it's second battery. I have a horrible feeling that it will probably outlive me at this rate <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/eek.gif"/>

class, i like that watch even if it is understated.
I am not too sure my wifes choice of watch says anyhting about her really.She just like the look of it.Sometimes she will go for rather more unusual items, but like your GF is not impressed at all by labels or particular brands

Mods, I don't think this thread has any purpose other than to goad and prevoke pointless bullying.

A thread started soley to harass people 'showing off' their cars in the Motoring forum wouldn't be tolerated, nor would a thread attacking people 'showing off' their pointless projectors in the Projector forum.

Is AVF now a place for people to feed their inferiority complex by attacking other people and their interests?

This really is shameless trolling! <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/mad.gif"/> <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/mad.gif"/> <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/mad.gif"/>

i would guess that the vast majority of watches are decent, ie they wont look or do anything indecent.I cant imagine, for example, many carrying pornographic images on them or uttering foul words at passers by.
I bought my Kahuna over the internet, forget who from but the service was quite decent.I wasnt offered the services of an escort as an inducement to buy it.

............I think you meant scratched didnt you? <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

A it happens i just wanted to set the record straight as to the meaning of the word decent because it implies that there are an awful lot of, in this case,indecent watches.A more appropriate title would be expensive well known brand watches or, why not, poncey watches

Where to buy a poncey watch online sounds great to me

Happily, this is an old thread that's been resurrected, otherwise your pretentious thread-crapping might have been annoying. Instead, everyone is just laughing at you.

By way of a (long overdue) update, I actually bought an Omega Seamaster from a high street store for my wife, which she was very chuffed with.

We all make do when we have no choice and telling yourself you are happy with the way things are is a defense mechanism! Dont worry about it, perfectly natural!

And of course she was thrilled, you actually bought her something <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/eek.gif"/> Poor girl is probably so unused to it that you could give her a turd in a box and she would probably well up <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/rotfl.gif"/>

Will you stop going on about "poncey names", when you're wearing a KAHUNA watch.
Kahuna can mean testicles or breasts, in 'street slang'.

I would also have my doubts about your wife's watch being 'made' by Navajo Indians.
Bought in and sold by Navajo indians, perhaps.
