Er, no. A war which is legally conducted, takes place between belligerents - typically in the form of opposing armed forces, or in some cases, between armed insurgents.

A war which includes 'crimes against humanity', would include the shelling of innocent people's homes, the use of napalm or white phosphorus, and the attacking of religious sites for no reason - all of which occurred in Iraq.

I can't explain myself much more clearly than by quoting someone else:

<quote orig_author="Hylean">
In my mind, in a war, you do whatever it takes to win. It's a war, you're killing people, including civilians (though not on purpose usually), and raising hell. How the **** can you say something or not is a crime? Fair enough, be outraged at how an army behaves, but that shouldn't be a crime. War itself is a crime, by the fact you have to kill people, invade, etc.

The entire concept just doesn't make sense.

This is compounded by the fact that if the winner is the one committing said "war-crimes" they'll never be accused or have anything happen to them.

War is war; it's not compassionate. It involves civilian deaths and it involves actions that would not normally be considered legal. There is no way you can win a war that only negatively affects the government with which you are going to war; civilian deaths are inevitable and arguably justified.

And as I said, this type of activity has been commonplace in almost every war that has ever happened, and every one that will happen in the future. And, as I said, no one's suggesting posthumously trying every single political leader who ever decided to go to war, are they?

As I've said over and over again, there is a thing called 'International Law'. We've ratified treaties, signed accords, spent decades fortifying diplomatic ties in order to build a comprehensive international law. If you transcend that, you have broken international law. That's why we tried every Nazi official at Nuremberg, rather than saying "that's how war is". Killing innocent civilians who are unarmed, or are not part of any beligerent force is ILLEGAL under international law.

IT DOESN'T GET ANY CLEARER THAN THAT.

i think an honest and independent investigation + trial is needed.

they should be tried for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of iraqis. the real weapons of mass destruction were the depleted uranium bombs and cluster bombs used in the war. <a href="http://www.sptimes.com/2003/05/25/columns/how_harmful_is_deplet.shtml">http://www.sptimes.com/2003/05/25/co...s_deplet.shtml</a> and the weapons that were were given to him by western powers which facilitated the death of iraqi and iranian civilians

their invasion, based on lies, resulted in a huge influx of terrorists in iraq. Saddam did kill many people but the carnage that resulted from this illegal war was far far greater. Al-qaeda only became fully established in iraq after the war.

we are a nation that is based on justice and equality before the law. These principles are what make this nation great. They misled parliament and congress and should face the consequences.

if they believe they are innocent then they should defend themselves before a court of law and under oath. launching an illegal war is a crime. just because there were worse war crimes comitted doesn't mean this particular one wasn't a war crime.

international law applies to everyone - not just african dictators.

You think we tried every Nazi official at Nuremberg? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/>

That's besides the point, though.

I don't know about Internation Law, but have you ever heard of Godwin's Law?

It doesn't get much clearer than that either! <img src="images/smilies/colone.gif"/>

I ask you though, if you are so damned sure that what Blair and Bush did was 100% illegal in international law, then why have they not yet been tried for their actions?

It's as if people just want to punish Tony Blair and George Bush for lying to them. Whether that's a war crime, I don't know. I don't think so. I thought it was just being a bastard.
