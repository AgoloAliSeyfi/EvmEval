I live in wichita and i hadnt even heard of the guy till he resurficed last may or so. It's kind of scary but the thing is he wants to be caught, he's just making people work to catch him. Every so often he leaves a package somewhere with clues to who he is. It's scary to know he's still out there but I'm not really concerned because he's old and all i have to do is kick him in the hip.....It was funny though because the day the news reported him back pepper spray sold out....People are freaking..

Honestly I don't think BTK lives in Wichita. I think he lives in one of the surrounding areas. Obviously Wichita Police are not smart enough to catch him.

i think this old guy is scared of dying without the recognition that he killed some ppl and trying to make history. if i were the police, after i find him i would just put him in an institution and not tell ppl who he was. i think that would be a worse punishment than jail.

if i met that guy on the street and he tried to kill me then i would just beat him with his own cane. stupid geezer.

Holy craaaaap, supposidly they have "the" B T K arrested today, his name is Dennis Rader and I'm sure if you watch news channels you will see it all over, they showed a picture of him and he looks like winnie the pooh with brown hair and a creepy smile, later on they will show a picture of him at the time they arrested him yesterday.

Yeah they got em. Finally. It's real interesting how everything just unfolded like it did. It's scary to think that he could have stood next to me in line at the movies or the store. He was the president of his church and a boy scout leader....just an ordinary kind of guy...scary.

I lived in Wichita about 20 yrs. ago, and he killed someone while I was there...I was a single woman living by myself in an apartment complex, and I was FREAKED....I'm so glad they caught the bastard...and I'm not surprised that he seemed like such a normal, "run-of the mill" sort of guy. That is why he was so hard to catch, I believe...he looks like the guy that would deliver your mail, mow your lawn for you if you were sick...very scary. I just read an article about how the people in his church (where, I think, they said he was president of the Board of Directors) reacted...can you imagine knowing this "nice" man for so many yrs., then finding out he was one of the most heinous (sp?) serial killers you had ever heard of?? Gives me the creeps. Like I said, I'm glad they caught the bastard.
