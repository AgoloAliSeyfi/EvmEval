I'm no expert by any means :) But I was talking to a woman the other day who recently moved here from England and she was saying that over there the type of cancer treatment you can be eligible to receive depends on what county you live in and that some are better than others. That surprised me. She also told me that wait times can be pretty bad for some surgeries (her father needed shoulder surgery and was in a lot of pain for six months). She wasn't down on NHS at all but was just saying that some things are better here (more treatment options, shorter wait times, more resources and support staff in hospitals, ect).
I know you live in Canada, but do find treatment options varying by where you live? Do wealthier Canadians still buy private insurance? Just curious about how it works there.

Most private insurance is through a workplace - for example, the company I worked for before I was self-employed offered a benefits package that paid for 50% of dental, optometrist, prescription, etc. Basically, things not covered under UHC. I wouldn't necessarily say that the wealthy have better additional coverage simply because they are wealthy, but because they are in jobs that offer those benefits.
Certain treatment options are definitely easier to get in larger metropolitan areas, simply because some rural regions don't have the population to support them. Some smaller hospitals (ie in a town with less than 20,000) don't usually deliver babies, you have to go a bigger hospital.
Midwivery services (which are covered under UHC) can be easier to get in larger centres. There has been a push lately to expand their services so that women in smaller communities have better access to them.
Very specialized cancer treatments tend to take place in larger centres (ie over 100,000) and most advanced cardiac care does too.

The question of public money being used to pay for it is a different one. I think that is actually the more difficult question as if we say that yes, in public payer situations (such as medicad or medicare in the US) that some legislation will dictate who is eligible for a procedure (rather than a doctor) and people who can self pay could get whatever treatment they can pay for... I am concerned as a society we will not be able to accept the consequences of this. That the rich will be able to get end of life care, potentially prolong life, while the middle and poor can not.

This already happens. Except it's not the government or legislation deciding who gets what care, it's private insurance companies who are unelected and accountable to no one.
