It always makes me laugh when people suggest there is no pattern between so called Islamic extremism and the oppression of Muslims. I know a Palestinian man at university whose mother was killed during an Israeli airstrike and whose brother was buried alive when their house was bulldozed- now tell me how likely is this man to turn to violence than a Muslim living comfortably in the suburbs of Birmingham? That's a rhetorical question in case you didn't realise that either.

What a retarded thing to say, what has a palestinian being killd by israel have t do with pakistan committing genocide aainst bengalis or hrbouring terrorists to bomb peopel in kashmir and i turns out, all over the world.
Like the other guy said above you always try tp blame your evils on smething else? Who were muslim fanatics blaming before israel existed?

pakistan was created by britain. Without us pakistan would have been another province of india. Well, that's difficult to say, without the british in india who knows what would have happened. But my point is, it was britain that created, or allowed the creation of, pakistan.
