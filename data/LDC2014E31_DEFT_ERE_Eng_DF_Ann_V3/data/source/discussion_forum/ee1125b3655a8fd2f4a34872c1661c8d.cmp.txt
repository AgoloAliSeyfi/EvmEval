Umm, just no. I live in Belfast as do my parents and they witnessed most of the troubles. My house has always been littered with an assortment of books on the wars etc. I could say a lot of sensitive information which would indicate my experience of the troubles but I won't.

It is too late for me to formulate a logical argument but you sir have failed.
Quite infantile response

I think that a little bit of Yeats could be rather neatly inserted here - do you recall the image of the "stone" from the poem Easter 1916?

Here, just to refresh your memory:

Hearts with one purpose alone
Through summer and winter seem
Enchanted to a stone
To trouble the living stream.

Make of it what you will. Also, you mentioned Connolly. Yes, the manner of his death was absolutely terrible - but it was partly his demise that instigated the condemnation of the executions by the general British public, and figures such as Asquith. It was a pathetic death, but one that resonated.

Incidentally, your little spiel about Michael Collins reminded me of the days when politics were banned in the house due to the husband being a passionate Collins man, and the wife being a fervent Dev supporter.

My skills at deciphering any poetry have a lot to be desired lol.
Yes the executions of the leader led to the Irish people wakining up and realising the Brits where a brutal regime.

I hate Collins so much it isn't even funny.

You are being absolutely insensitive to that person's experiences - by proxy or otherwise - of the troubles. You react to any challenge of your resolutely single minded world view, with a bullish spiel of old history book propaganda that most of us have disregarded by now - and a smugness that is utterly unappealing, and which reflects badly on the "cause" and "ideals" you seem to be propagating.

Having an English/Irish dual nationality, I have relatives who were shot by the IRA, and relatives who were roughed up and subjugated by the Unionist crowd. So please - I recommend that you consider a little more before writing all of your mad antediluvian opinions on a public forum, where people you deride for not agreeing with you may 'actually' have very good reasons for not doing so, despite your 'arguments' supplemented by a selective usage of historical facts.

Sorry but being from the occupied territory I would have a lot of the same experiences as that person. She said I didn't know my history because apparently I haven't read enough history books which I replied to. If she wants to challenge my knowledge of the history of the war or my politics then she should be able to back it up rather that off hand comments.

What I dislike even more is those who know nothing apart from what the BBC have told them trying to tell me I know nothing.

Fair enough. I'm rather wondering what your opinion of Tim Pat Coogan's biography of De Valera is actually <img src="images/smilies/colone.gif"/>

Nonetheless, do attempt to modulate your tone perhaps. It is rather invigorating to see that some people are still passionate about their cultural history however <img src="images/smilies/colonhash.gif"/>
