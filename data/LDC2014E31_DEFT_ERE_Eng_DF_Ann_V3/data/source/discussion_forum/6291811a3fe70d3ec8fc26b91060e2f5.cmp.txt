sorry i dont understand your point relating to india and china?

yes, whilst that is true what im saying is the chances of it happening in the near future arent high at all. it is clear the government are in no mood to let these people populate the BIOT and with Diego Garcia being one of the most important military instilations at the americans disposal, especially now that iran has began to tick them off the chances of america moving out on the renewal date are next to nill.
for fear of sounding callous, wasnt that their choice to move here? where despite them complaining about having to put up with the rubbish english climate it is undeniable they have a far better quality of life than either Mauritius or BIOT could offer them.
please you cannot possibly compare the two? and besides the americans have plenty of air bases in mainland britain why would they want one up in the shetlands <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/> the base doesnt just provide the americans with a handy little tick on their tally sheet for military instillations it serves as a vital instilation for forward projection power across the globe, its been used for afghanistan, iraq, libya and countless other missions have taken off from there. my point is that whilst it is of course very sad the islanders were removed would the benefits to millions [hear me out here] that having the base their not out weigh them? one could argue that without having bases like this around the globe the americans ability to topple dictators as part of NATO for the good of these countries would have been severely effected.

Fair enough, I couldn't think of a decent island, so I just used Shetland as a lame example. My point about India and China is that together they will be overtaking the US in terms of military spending by 2025. And if things go as I feel they will, the global South will start to dominate the North, whilst the US will lose a lot of what it currently has, I have a feeling that the rise of more superpowers and India's heavy population in Mauritius will mean that it is unlikely that the US will be able to maintain a military base so close to Mauritius. (Mauritius effectively 'belongs' to India, it's heavily influenced by them would probably be the best way to put it). So the chances in the short-term are yes, very unlikely, but what's the point in campaigning for anything if they're not achievable in the long run?

You talk about dictators etc. You're telling me that by not using some other base in Europe for example, America couldn't have achieved those aims? I highly doubt it, there is no need to remove an entire population for self-gain.

While you're there OP, make sure you campaign for every territory on earth which has been populated by force to be returned to there original inhabitants. You know being fair and all.

They were forcibly expelled from Diego Garcia so the British could sell off the land to the Americans so they could build a torture centre/military base there. Of course they have the right to return.
