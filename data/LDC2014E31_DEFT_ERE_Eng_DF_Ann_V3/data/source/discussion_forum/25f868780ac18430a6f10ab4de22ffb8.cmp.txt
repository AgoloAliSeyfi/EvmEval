haha palestinians, how bout the 3000 dead in the gaza war lmao. You sicken me.

Hmm, so where is your evidence of this? Who reported these stats?

Also, why do I 'sicken' you? Don't want to see the truth, huh?

<quote orig_author="A level Az">
I don't know where you got your evidence for &amp;quot;very few civilians&amp;quot; because the current death toll says otherwise. What makes you think dropping random bombs is killing specifically muslim terrorists, wipe out everyone and you'll get them too? Is that the plan?

</quote>

They aren't random attacks.

Bearing in mind the US has been free from terrorist attacks for ages, and that 9/11 itself was clearly not executed by a few guys sitting in a cave on the other side of the world.

Ah, what good is a US bashing thread without a conspiracy theory? You make me laugh, twoofer. All the evidence points to 9/11 being a terrorist attack and that youtube video has been debunked multiple times. Those engineers simply crave attention.

<quote>
One thing we can be sure of though is that when the US does finally stop attacking, they are going to get a taste of their own medicine eventually, because the damage they've caused is irreversible. They've brought it upon themselves by being so power hungry and attracted to oil like a moth to a flame.

Oh right, so you are suggesting we keep this up indefinitely? Do you know how much these wars are costing us? Also, these wars having nothing to do with oil. We actually got less oil out of Iraq after the war and what oil is there in afghanistan?

So they made up the foreign policy stuff to hide their true agenda which is the hatred of the western way of life and of the world's existence!!! they are run by Dr Evil himself with his evil plot to destroy the world!!!!!!

This is the real world not your stupid fictional film where evil geniuses exist and want to destroy everything.

Everything he said is factually correct. All of al-Qaeda's actions against America have been justified by them on the basis of propagating Islam. And you just use a bunch of exclamation marks and a Mike Meyers character, and don't even deal with the facts he cited.

Problem is, were those drone strikes to stop you would have far more attempted terrorist attacks. The collateral is horrible yes but if they stop al Qaeda and these other groups aren't going to say well that was very nice of America shall we all go home?

calling deaths "collateral damage" is stupid.

The bombing of the embassies started before America "invaded Muslim lands" (whatever the hell that means). These radical Wahhabis hate the entire world, and even if we stopped and withdrew all troops tomorrow, they would continue to attack us regardless of foreign policy. The only way to deal with such people is to arrange an appointment for them with their Maker.

hmm thats because maybe they are...

whats your definition of being treated like scum?

Hmm mine is:

1. Having your land split into lots of little pieces. So much so that you have to go to another country to get to parts of your own country.
2. Having even more of your partitioned land being taken for you.
3. To make things worse have a wall being put in your land. And your entry/exit out of this wall is controlled. like a concentration camp in the holocaust...easily forgotten right? quick to remember it when you want to.
4. Having white phosphorous bombs chucked on you.
5. Having a blockade imposed on me.

They are being treated like scum you ****ing idiot.
