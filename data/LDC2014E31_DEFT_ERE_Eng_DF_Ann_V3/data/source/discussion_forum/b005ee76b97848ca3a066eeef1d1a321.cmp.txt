Throwaway article but for the comments...

When you are down to trolling article comments your debating cred borders on third grade levels...

Look into the Turkish history and you will find nothing of value. Nothing you can contribute to humanity. All you discover is invasion, murder and genocide. A nomadic people, whose birthplace and origin is in Mongolia, showed up on their horses and with their swords in Asia Minor. Turkish history is filled with bloodshed of the native people of the lands they put under their swords. A people with no intellect, acquired all the false glory they attribute to themselves from the creativity of the people they enslaved. Their entire culture is stolen from other nations they enslaved. Their buildings and monuments built by enslaved native people of the lands over which they ruled ruthlessly. They took their lessons from their Mongol cousins and masters. They are unfamiliar with the civilized world. They are very familiar with taking and acquiring things by force. They respect force and respond to force only. It's time to FORCE them down to their knees and give them a bitter taste of their own medicine.

She means that backwards peasants like yourself should be happy that kind folk such as the Ottomans &amp; others removed from you the burden of having to govern yourselves. Something at which you would no doubt have failed anyway, thus justifying the ongoing occupation (&amp; occasional bouts of mass murder, pillage etc.).

I was thinking more of the Roman 'occupation' of large parts of Europe and Greek/Macedonian interaction with Eastern astonomy and maths etc to be precise.

To tell you something... it is correct notion, Turks (Ottomans) taxed us 10% from the GDP, current budget is 30+% from the GDP. Turks built more infrastructure then our government in the last 20 years.

Me and trading.Good grief,I'm more incompetent than my government.Granted,I may show more goodwill and not outright treason,but that's it. C'mon,if the crusaders ever will march to Bosphorus I plan to give back whatever they'll loot from Big K.That's how dumb I am.
Kerim,now you owe me some Ulker biscuits for my future troubles. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/eek.gif"/>

Now a bit more seriously.Stuff happened.Stuff may happen in the future.But much bigger forces than our tastes and idiosincracies will lead our fates.We don't know and we can't know.But I know a story from the past.
2 best friends served in WW1 as officers in the AH army.One war ended,another started,but their nations were now enemies.The 2 guys shook hands,decided a place and a time for a meeting after the war and went to do their duty.Our guy's side won,but they were still best buddies.IMO,that's how real men should behave.Can't say for women though,that's Snapper's realm. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/biggrin.gif"/>

To be honest, the last time Chrisitans from the west got their grubby paws on the Hagia Sofia they ransacked it &amp; turned it into one of their churches. Sound familiar? BTW, do you plan to repatriate the bits of the Temple of Artemis that were incorporated into the Hagia Sophia?

You act like you have never heard about Article 301 which makes it a crime to insult Turkishness whatever that means.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_301_(Turkish_Penal_Code">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article...ish_Penal_Code</a> )

have you also heard of this guy named Orhan Pamuk who was hauled to court for saying that Turkey committed crimes against Kurds and Armenians.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orhan_Pamuk#Criminal_case">Orhan Pamuk - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a>

I don't care how you call it but Turkey is guilty of committing mass murder of Armenians. Go suck a lemon if you aint happy with what I said.....

To engage in Armenian Genocide discussion is to engage in Turkish propaganda......this is another reason why such laws are needed.

Article 301?.....KKK ideology comes a distant second.

Ohran Pamuk:

Genocide Recognition is about Justice, Not Freedom of Thought

Regardless of Frances ultimate aims or intentions, Turkish society and its educated classes are once again reminded that we need to resolve this very fundamental issue. Some may object that this should have happened some other way, but if you dont solve your problems on your own, often enough someone else will force a solution on you. Thats the way its always been in this world.
