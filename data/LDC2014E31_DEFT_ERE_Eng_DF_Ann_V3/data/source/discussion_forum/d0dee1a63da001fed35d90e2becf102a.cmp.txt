"And they have been paid appropriately for their labors..."

I think that proably our biggest problem is that that is very rarely true.
It would probably be at least as true to say that those who work the hardest are paid the least.

And that was certainly a motivator for me to work my way up the career ladder of my profession. As one who finished the BSN at 41, I knew I would not really feel like thumping up and down the halls of a hospital for very many years. But, believe it or not, there are people who really like what they do even though you consider it to be menial. I know nurses who work the bedside, who have always worked the bedside, and will have to be carried off the job feet first if they ever leave the beside. People who work at hard labor are fit and healthy and live fairly long lives. When we were young, before my husband got an easier job, he did manual labor. He was tan and muscular and looked like a Greek god. I often wonder if he might have lived longer had he stayed with a more physically demanding job. I often wonder that about myself, although my arthritis usually answers the question for me. The big problem with people who have your attitude is that you demean honest forms of work. If they have made peace with their pay, then there is no reason you should not be at peace with their pay as well. When I was in the hospital about to die back in August, did I want a psych NP, a clone of myself? Oh HELL no! I wanted a good staff level nurse who knew how to take care of me because I couldn't take care of myself. And I wanted a good nursing assistant who would help me wash my hair, bathe, and feel like a human being again. They were there. And ya know what, almost to the person the CNAs were in nursing school and the nurses were in NP school. For I was hospitalized at Vanderbilt where employees can get their education for free if they contract to work there for a while.

"The big problem with people who have your attitude is that you demean honest forms of work. "

On the contrary my purpose in responding to this thread has been to point out that there is nothing shameful in having priorities other than making the maximum possible amount money and that simply having money does not mean you are more intelligent or industrious than anyone else. By the same token not having a great deal of money doesn't mean someone expects, wants or needs some kind of handout. And it most certainly does NOT follow that a lack money indicates a lazy welfare cheat and/or drug dealer.

"I know nurses who work the bedside, who have always worked the bedside, and will have to be carried off the job feet first if they ever leave the beside."

That would be me for 40+ years (except for the feet first part). And I could only dream of the pay and benifits a union welder gets.

I have also worked at Vanderbuilt. The average nurse there impressed me as being more interested in finding a doctor to marry than in their patients.

All thsoe things are fine and dandy, but not what the thread is about. If someone isnt interested in making the max amt of money he can, fine. I'm not. I have other priorities. But I'm not sitting around expecting the state to pay my rent and food bill either. But lots of people are. And they are the problem, simply because they cause a demand on other people's resources.
Vanderbilt (not Vanderbuilt--I doubt you worked there) is a teaching hospital. So nursing care isn't wonderful.

In frequent threads here the brain-dead leftists moan about how the "idle rich" (like there is such a thing) don't deserve their money. But look at the other side. The poor in this country enjoy a lifestyle envied by even middle class people in most of the world. What have they done to deserve this? The idlest of the idle rich invest money and help other hard working people get ahead. The poor simply absorb tax payer funding and have babies.

Has anyone else noticed the recent concerted effort by the GOP to paint being poor in America as desirable and good?

Just another indicator of how out of touch the party is.
