LGS, there has to be a level playing field here. Lot of people get depressed and go through a period of feeling frankly useless to society, their self esteem takes a nose dive when they lose their job. Is it really good that a doctor is happy to collude with them and just write them off because that's how they feel. Say Ken's single, is it really a great idea encouraging him into a life of perhaps sitting at home all day on his own, perhaps he'd spend the day propping up the bar in the local. That's what I see on a daily basis in my community, people who might be 40 but look like 60 <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/frown.gif"/>

Could Ken not get in his car if he has a driving license and drive around reading electricity / gas metres?

Frankly i dont blame him at all 38 years hard slog is a long time and he deserves it, after all policemen retire in their fifties so if a bloke knackers himself working hard then i have no problem with what is a paltry sum anyway

Absolutely, but please don't mix up being able to retire and being on the sick.

All fair points (to the post before that, the latter one is rubbish), but there is a lot more than just office work. Heck I even supplied a very constructive example to help young lads from ending up like he did.

However the point is whether that is for the GP to judge? If he rather wants to retire then fine, retire but not on sick benefits.

Heck the way my week is turning out to be I'd like to retire as well, my head is exploding and I think I am turning mad. That is mentally disabled ;-) Unfortunately I can't quite afford to retire yet, should I go and see the doctor and get a note to top up my income?

as i said you keep dismissing his condition as if it was no big deal &lt;ie personally would trust the judgement of a doctor on such matters relating to health, that is what the are paid for.I am not going to take a notice of some bloke who just decides to have an opinion.
Btw i know someone who was forced to retire in her forties due to the fact her right leg got knackered doing the same job day in day out.Her condition deteriorated steadily over the years and now she hasnt got a chance of ever been able to work or to even get employment again.

Hes 54, on average males in the UK die at 76. So he has twenty two years of life still ahead of him.

His thirty eight years of NI contributions wont have covered twenty two years of then being paid to do nothing. Do the maths.

What kind of society are we creating? Full of work shy spongers I would say.

aqs i said in one of my posts if he is offered support and encouragement then yes some kind of employ would be good for him, but these are tough times and jobs are hard to get so to expect to him to hobble along on his own steam to find employment is unrealistic IMO

So do you refuse to read the bit about the doctor even suggesting other work? But then caving in for other reasons?

If he'd done a couple of degrees, and not worked while he earned them, then went into the world of work at age 27, worked for 38 years and then had this problem at age 65, would the comments be the same? I'm just curious, I'm neither for nor against "Ken".
