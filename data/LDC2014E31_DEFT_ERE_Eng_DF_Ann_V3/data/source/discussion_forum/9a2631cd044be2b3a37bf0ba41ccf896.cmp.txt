So far 4 people killed/murdered in the riots (3 innocents ran over protecting their community, 1 shot) and devastation to property and small businesses which has wrecked livelihoods. Â£100 millions worth of damage.

This isn't about Mark Duggan anymore.

Why are the media so keen on showing the collapse of society in England to the whole world brought by youths, when they were a product of their own society? (Constant ILLUMINATION of materialistic things - hence the looting.

Why did these youths feel the need to loot and riot, they weren't born angry rioters where they?

Makes you think what the Gvt. is really up to. I am aware people have their own theories (New world order, deliberate collapse of the economy and the riots are just a catalyst etc)

While they're already at it, why shouldn't they attack the real thieves? The banks for bringing us into global recession again, politicians, parliament? The people of Libya and Egypt rose up against the corruption and won, we could have a shot, couldn't we?

Makes you think why any major police involvement was delayed while the major cities were getting burnt to the ground, but if they went anywhere near the banks or parliament, I guarantee large numbers of police brutality would be reported and the army would be called in, no hesitation.

The governments best interests are not the people. Look at the bigger picture.
Just a thought.

(I'm sure the majority will disagree with what I'm saying, but do your research.)

What's your view on the police and Gvt. on the riots?

Personally feel sorry for the police; everyone is the country (apart from the do-gooders) is egging them on to use their bloody baton instead of shoving them, but as the news stalk the police, they can't do much because then sky news or bbc play constant replays of the incidents- 'Did the officers use extreme force here' 'that man was knocked off his bike' 'how do we know he planned to use the concrete brick in his hand' etc!

Oh and to state the obvious what started out as a stupid protest (protesting about an armed drug dealer/gangster being shot, whether he shot first or whatever) to young kids thinking they deserve what they want without working for it (todays culture of putting everything on credit cards etc to get things now) and then the oppertunists who see it as a way to make some quick money (please note, to the woman shown on sky news stealing a carpet, and the man stealing a kilo bag of rice, you are stupid)

I also see a lot of it as people who come over here are used to getting benefits,housing, medical care etc so think why shouldn't they have big fancy tv's and designer clothes? we are a country who are too soft, do what austrailia do, let the brain surgeons in and keep the scroungers out (also i am well aware of there being many british people involved but we are sadly stuck with them while at least if some are foreign they can go home; we have more than enough to deal with!)
