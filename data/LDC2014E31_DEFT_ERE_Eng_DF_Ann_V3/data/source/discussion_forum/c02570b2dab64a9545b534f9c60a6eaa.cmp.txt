I'm the same. I'm quite bemused by this thread - I don't know anyone who makes a full on fuss of their birthday after the age of about 16!

If my birthday happens to fall on a working day, then I go to work. If it falls on a non-working day, but during the week, then I will be at home doing the housework, and DH will be at work and the children will be at school. If it falls on a weekend, we will probably go to the supermarket! Business as usual here.

The weekend of my birthday, I will arrange a meal out with DH and a bunch of friends. If I want to do that I arrange it, DH arranges it for his birthday, friends arrange it for their own etc. We don't exchange presents, or pay for the birthday boy/girls meal or anything, just go out as a big group for a meal or for a few drinks. Surely spending a night out with friends is celebration/recognition enough? I can't see how which month you were born in makes the least bit of difference?

Anyway, it sounds as though you have plans, so enjoy your birthday. But don't feel bad about other people not making a fuss/taking the day of work etc, that's fairly normal.

My thoughts exactly. It's my 30th birthday (eeeeeek) a week today and I'll be going to work as normal, but having a meal out with OH in the evening. Perhaps a few drinks in the pub with my mates on the following weekend, if they are free.

My birthday is a January one too, it actually fell on the Saturday just gone woohoo !! Anyhoo had to take my little boy to his swimming, shop, clean etc, so I had my birthday yesterday instead. Went over to Hebden Bridge, had a pint, had a lovely walk by the river, twas great. Last year went to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park with my friend, had a long walk and went to cafe for a huge slab of cake. I'm easily pleased. The lovely thing is lots of birthday cash to spend in the sales!!
