i really dont know what to do... im up to my eyes in debt with virtually no income. I have my own business but work as all but dried up...to supplement the lack of income i have used cc's for basics for paying the mortage hoping that things will pick up, but they havent.

im scared, i dont know who to turn to, money is fast running out. i havent access to anymore, and to be honest i dont want it.

Things are very dark at the moment, in my mind, i have considered taking my own life and to be rid of that twisting pain in my gut... i guess i am paralysed with fear of the unknown... this isnt me normally i am a confident bloke in his mid fortys, why have i failed so miserably?? i am a joke to my wife and family. its the cc debts that are spiralling out of control at 25k i cant even pay the minimum repayments.....

i feel sick just thinking about it, i havent slept for ages properly and its affecting my health.... i guess this is a last plea for help and guidance, before i do something silly.

Please don't do anything stupid. It is only money. I dont mean that in a patronising way, I know from my own experience that it takes up all your thoughts and totally drains you. But at the end of the day it's just money and thats nothing compared to your own wellbeing. Talking about the problem will help you deal with it. It sounds like your wife doesnt really know the situation? If so, tell her. When I told my bf about my financial state it was scary to do and I was sure he would leave but nope, he's supported me and I felt a lot better once I had let out the problem. I'd been dealing with it myself for too long. If you're not ready to talk to her then talk to anyone - someone you trust, a counsellor etc You should also speak to one of the debt charities for proper advice on what to do regarding your finances. I found Christians Against Poverty were amazing and so so supportive so I would recommend them. The woman I dealt with seemed to understand my mental state and was so non judgemental.
Things will get better. It might not seem like it right now but they really will.

Can I just say that i understand how you feel. I ran my own business and i worked for the last year without taking a single penny in wages. I know how it feels to wake up at 5am in the morning feeling sick and feeling like you're trapped and there's no way out. I just wanted to say that in my experience the fear of the unknown is the worst thing. Once you face up to the situation and start to deal with it it will not be as scary as living in constant fear and anxiety. I closed my business and it was a very difficult time (i'm still dealing with it all now, 9 months on) but i feel better for having a clear idea of what i'm dealing with instead of constantly living in fear. I had this strategy i used - every time i had to deal with something difficult, i imagined the worst case scenario and i got my head around that - what would i do if.... In reality most things don't result in the worst case scenario and so you find that dealing with them isn't as awful as you imagine.
