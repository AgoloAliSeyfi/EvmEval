but the timing for one (just before Obama's re-election campaign).

</quote>

Within a year and a half of an election, in a four year term. No.

<quote>
Then there's the fact of there being no footage and the body being buried at sea. When the United States captured Saddam Hussein..his pictures were all over the news..wouldn't it make sense to at least release one proper picture of Bin Laden too to silence all the critics?
</quote>

No, it wouldn't be politically easy, and the only people who'd care are conspiracy theorists, to whom evidence doesn't matter a jot.

<quote>
Also, how could they have been able to undertake the DNA tests AND bury his body so quickly when the place where the body was found..Abbotabad is in the northern area of Pakistan and about a 1000 miles inland (with only Pakistan's extreme soouthern border being a coastal area).

Because they can fly at high speed, you silly sod. You could drive 1000 miles in a day, quite conceivably.

<quote>
Are there any other facts or incidents that make his death seem a bit sketchy? Or prove that it was correct except for various statements from governments etc..because I mean, being a history student.. if the death was a sham, then this wouldn't be the first time governmetns have used propaganda stories for their benefit.. But then again, for all we know.. he could really have been killed or perhaps he's been dead for a long time but getting caught by the USA seemed a befitting way for him to die? I don't know what to make of the whole thing to be honest.. I can't see his death reducing the scale of the 'War on Terror'.. But I do hope that the news of his death brings some closure to the 9/11 victims..it's been a tough ride for them..and for all of us
</quote>

Yeah, and perhaps Pakistan doesn't actually exist. As a history student, I'd expect you to be able to discern between credible sources, non-credible sources and sheer speculation.

I'm quite surprised how quick the yanks buried him. I thought they should spend weeks or months examining his body.

For what? He's not bloody Superman...

When will people realise that governments, while they do lie/bend the truth, arent going to be so stupid as to fake the death of a terrorist leader.

</quote>

That is quite naieve. Governments not only lie and bend the truth, but they actively conspire and drive world events for their own means and ends. If they need to pull something like the death of Osama off in order to paint Obama in a favourable light then they will do just that, and they will deal with any consequences that arise. Afterall, if all goes tits-up they can just blame it on the conspiracy theorists.

As much as I usually disagree with your posts, i think i might just agree with you on this one.
