You asked about baggage. You don't get to define the terms about what should or should not be baggage and say "we'll talk" as if your terms make the baggage no more.

Baggage IS, whether you think it is logical or not. And Gingrich has it.

Yes, because there are a lot of shallow halfwits in this country who've been weaned on The National Inquirer and now don't seem to know how to differentiate between politicians and celebrities and set priorities when it comes to elections.

I don't get to tell you what inane bullshit you can or can't value over little things like issues, positions, and plans, but I sure as hell DO get to tell you that your "baggage" is a load of crap if that's what I think. And I do. So again, feel free to vote for the person who seems warm and fuzzy to you, but don't even consider coming in here and bitching about the problems in this country afterward. Your response is going to be, "But I'm sure he sends his condolences for your suffering, and that's all you cared about, isn't it?"

Myself, I'd rather have a coldhearted bastard who can fix our problems than a nice, likable person who sympathizes with them.

You asked about the baggage. I noted some of it. You can deny it all you want, but it exists.

Newt is not a viable candidate.

That's the bottom line.

Any in the field are viable...moreso than Obama ever was.

YOu know why I don't buy what she said. She and Thomas worked at the Department of Education, where he was supposedly a creep. Then he went to EEOC.

Now most people, when they have a boss they hate, they have a little party. They do a little dance. They say a little prayer of thanks to whatever sky pixie they worship. They don't make an effort to get that person back into their lives.

Hill took a transfer to work with Thomas again. Despite the supposed sexual harrassment.

Then she maintained contact with him for a decade, going back to him for letters of recommendation. This is really making a lot of effort to keep someone you hate in your life.

Then lo and behold, he's up for this appointment, and she comes out of the woodwork and says he did this... um... stuff... which really amounted to less obnoxious behavior than I see in my office every day. Which no one else in the office actually said they saw.

You don't have the facts straight, or the background knowledge of the situation.

Most people aren't in Hill's position. Clerking for a federal judge is a very big deal. It was an even bigger deal for a black woman back then. If she pisses Thomas off, it's very easy for him to ruin her career.

As for going back for letters of recommendation, he's the judge that she clerked for. So what does she say when she applies for positions? "I clerked for a federal judge, but don't ask me which one". <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

As for "no one else saw it", do you really think that's a compelling argument? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

Hill didn't come "out of the woodwork". She was about to be subpoenaed, so she came in voluntarily.

What I know about abolishing the czars is that they're Unconstitutional and have no business having power in our federal government, and thus, I know that it's an excellent idea to return that power to the people duly elected or appointed in accordance with law.

But as I mentioned earlier, I realize that laws are just suggestions to be ignored at will to leftists, so I don't expect you to understand why they're so important to the rest of us.

The czars are not unconstitutional. You have no clue what you're talking about.

Let me guess. You were in middle school when Clinton was impeached?

Run along, Junior. It would take a brain transplant to bring you up to speed enough to understand what happened, and I don't have that much patience with fools.

No patience with fools. Then your inner life must be hell. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

I'm old enough to remember the Cuban Missile Crisis, the assassinations of JFK, RFK, and MLK, the first moonwalk, and when the Andy Griffith Show was in black and white. I watched the Watergate hearings live, and I remember the Clinton impeachment hearings well.

In other words, you're wrong on the facts, and in your guesses. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>
