I sometimes wonder if when Pelosi and Reid took over Congress and spent most of their time investigating and undermining Bush that they also purposefully took their eye's off the ball and the growing economic problems of the country.

How could they miss the inevitable housing bubble that most Americans suspected all along, given that they were directly responsible and had the inside scoop for instance? Bush warned them several times but they refused to act...mmm

Everyday in every way I find it more amazing how the haters and liars just keep on with their crap. If only 10% of what they say even approached the truth our country would have folded up in 1777. What is so conservative about any conservative? If they have any redeeming qualities I fail to recognize them. History will indeed be very kind to President Barack Hussein Obama for many things beyond those that are so readily obvious.

History as taught and learned by the left wing propagandists will likely be kind to President Obama.

But if they were honest and objective, they wouldn't be.

This is part of why stooges like you cannot see even a glimmer of reality.

So you agree that if only 10% of what hacks like you say were true then our wonderful country would have folded in 1777? Or did I confuse you with someone with a different critical thinking skill set?

Had it been any one of those other palookas, say, Cain'n'Palin the country would have been in shambles.

Obama has pulled the country back from the brink of disaster that Bush'n'Cheney had left it in.

</quote>

All by himself? You don't think Bush getting TARP and bailing out the banks, even the ones that did not need it, had any impact at all?

<quote orig_author="MarcATL">
He's created ObamaCare, because, as we all know, Obama cares.

</quote>

Obama cares all right, he cares about getting reelected.

<quote orig_author="MarcATL">
He's brought dignity back to the Office.

</quote>

Dignity? Did he do that by bowing to everyone he met, or did he do it by attacking Libya?

[quote=MarcATL;4702675]The economy has been steadily ticking up.;/quote]

Finally. What did Obama do to cause that?

<quote orig_author="MarcATL">
He saved GM...a WHOPPING success.

</quote>

He did at that, even if he ignored the law to do it.

<quote orig_author="MarcATL">
He got Bin Laden from a place that Bush didn't dare to go into. Khaddaffi's gone. Pirates of the seas know they can't 'EFF around with Americans or any of their properties.

</quote>

Bush thought it was a bad idea to attack allies. From the fallout in our relationship with Pakistan it appears he might have been right.

Qaddafi was captured and killed, in that order. Sounds like something to be proud of, if you care nothing about law.

Does that mean that the pirates that inadvertently seized that American yacht gave it, and the hostages back?

<quote orig_author="MarcATL">
He helped to liberate a country from a tyrant w/o spending too much time, money and with no casualties.

</quote>

Are you talking about Syria?

<quote orig_author="MarcATL">
The rest of the world knows the same. Although he's not going around screaming about how big'n'tuff 'Murrka is.

</quote>

Can you tell me how often Iran threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz when Bush was president?

<quote orig_author="MarcATL">
He's pulling us out of war.

And, once again, the economy continues to tick up, despite his opponents in the GOP's efforts to undermine him at every. single. turn.

Yeah...I'd say Obama's a shoe-in for the next election.

</quote>

The word you want is shoo in.

<quote orig_author="MarcATL">
Not to mention, History is going to be VERY kind to Obama...unlike the last guy.

If Reid and Pelosi had actually investigated gwb as you claim and I wished then he and many of his administration and other war criminals would now be in prison.
