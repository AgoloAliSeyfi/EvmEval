Just as a point of order, the Guardian's 'roots' aren't anything close to left-wing politics. When it was formed, in the 19th century, the Manchester Guardian was a very liberal paper, holding views that people now would associate with the 'right wing' - economic liberalisation, personal liberty etc etc.

So, if anything, the Guardian is currently departing more and more from its original roots.

I'm going to counter this by saying you could be looking at this through era dependent lens. Obviously things that appeared left-wing then would be perceived as right-wing now. Nonetheless, I don't know enough about this topic to go on.

As a person who lives in the US (up to three hours form now), I can whole-heartedly agree with this <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.png"/> It doesn't get more biased than american media.

Okay. I'm going to ask; how is it you got accepted into Oxford but rejected by Warwick and UCL? <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/>

Someone started an article on the biasness of The Times. The Guardian have completely opposite views. They are very much against Murdoch, Cameron and the Conservative party. Obviously, acknowledging the fact that The Guardian was the paper that revealed this scandal. Here are some headlines and snippets of the paper I picked out that showed their political agenda.

Front page headline : 'Cameron spoke to Murdoch executives about BSkyB bid'
Labour: 'PM's judgment failed on phone hacking'
'Coulson was never given top security clearance'

All of these quotes are headlines against Cameron.

Simon Hoggart's sketch - 'The PM believes we are all inocent until found guilty - twice, in Mr Coulson's case.'

Reflections on the benefit of hindsight piece on pages 6 and 7 - This looks at all the News international executives that have used 'hindsight' as an excuse for their own behavioural conduct.

In the opinion sections on page 34 - 'The fear that those who crossed him (Murdoch) would get the full tabloid treatment, has proved a powerful mafia like power racket'... Goes on to mention the threat news international offers to other media organisations and the whole principle of democracy in this country.

Letter page reflects paper's agenda and that of their readership it would seem. One was congratulating The Guardian for their exposure of the hacking scandal and saying it would be business as usual with the Tory part if it hadn't been exposed. Couldn't agree more!

What do other people think? My point is it's astonishing how papers have such different views on things in this country. I'm a Journalism student, actively encouraged to read a wide variety of newspapers and media.

The guardian is pro labour left wing tripe.

No matter what the story. No matter who is involved the Guardian will find a way of pinning in on the tories.

You know, you really shouldn't support a man who supports Geert Wilders. Kind of racist.

What's Geert Wilders done or said that is racist?

Genuine question. All I know of him is that he made a video about Islam.

All papers have a bias. What annoys me is when I've met people who think The Times is the most credible and has no bias which I disagree with.

To The Times' credit, it is the newspaper which has the broadest range of views in their opinion pages. Whilst the leading articles have a clear consensus, the opinion pages are brilliantly varied.

It happens, I've a friend who is reading Economics at Oxford, who was rejected by UCL. He's so good he's become a scholar for his second year, too.

Interviews + entrance exams &gt; personal statements.

Yeah you are right. They are even more varied than the comments pages on the guardian. But overall as a paper it has just as much a bias as the Guardian.

It supported the Lib dems for the election, it isn't pro-labour.

The thread was created for the same reason the one about The Times was. It was just to show the biasness of newspapers in this country. I thought it would kick start some sensible discussion. <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

The guardian is a centre left paper who support Labour and are against News Corp. Times is a paper owned by News Corp and is centre right. Of course these papers will have different perspectives on the story. The Times is owned by Murdoch they can't slag him off really.

Also if people hate the guardian so much why read it? There's loads of other papers to read.

This. It is clear to me The Guardian has a left-wing bias - that's obvious. I don't think, however, that they are any more left-wing than The Times is right-wing. As I am left-wing myself, I tend to think the Guardian is very very awesome indeed.

I don't really have an idea... UCL said my personal statement was weak - Warwick gave no explanation...
