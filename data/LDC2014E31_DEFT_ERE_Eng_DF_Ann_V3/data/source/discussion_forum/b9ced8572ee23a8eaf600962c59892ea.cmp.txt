No, the fact that they don't have to pay through the nose for nusience lawsuits, silly regulations, and having the most worthless person on staff walk away with a bag of money because she heard a crude joke is a big part of it, too.

At my last job (where the crazy, anorexic lesbian almost got the manager fired because she didn't like being told to do work) I worked with a Russian guy, and tried to explain to him that he couldn't say certain things because they could get him fired. He looked at me like I was crazy. "In my country, judge throw you out of court for that!"

Oh, speaking of the crazy, anorexic lesbian... kept track of her for about two years after they finally did fire her. She couldn't hold down a job for more than six month. I think I did her resume for her twice.

You are really letting your imagination run away with you. No one can sue,and get heard, because of a single crude joke.

It doesn't take a psychic to realize the feminist circuit would reward her handsomely for protecting the holy right to suck babies into sinks. She made a backstabbing calculation that paid off for her. And all she has to do is live with herself. I'm glad I don't have to.

Again, this is your imagination at work. She did not go voluntarily. You continue to accuse her of something along the lines of witchcraft. This ordinary person got powerful Senators to subpoena her with mind control so she could earn speaking fees. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

Has nothing to do with me, I'm sharp enough to avoid the traps. But the fact the traps are out there for the useless to screw the useful is bad enough.

Not the point. Your whining is epic. You can't even tell a woman you work with about a porn movie, or ask her out multiple times, without her getting all bent out of shape. You poor thing.

Well, that's not what he was doing. There was a big difference between his grandmother wanting her no-account, unemployed husband to drive her to work because there was a belligerent stew-bum (who happened to be black) at her bus stop, and Reverand Wright screaming anti-white and anti-Americans obscentities in a HOUSE OF GOD* where Obama brought his children.

(*- full disclosure, I'm an atheist, but that religious people would tolerate this kind of nonsense is telling.)

He should have denounced and distanced himself from Wright then and there. He instead threw granny (who happened to be sickly at the time) under the bus. Only after Wright wouldn't shut his pie-hole did Obama finally do the right thing.

Well it is what Obama was doing. Pointing out that everyone has bias, and that we have an obligation to better our selves. I'm sorry you didn't realize that, but you could go back and read the speech now. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

What Wright said is comparable to what Falwell and Robertson said, without impugning it to supernatural influences.

All three ministers blamed America for 9/11.

What "transgressions"? Clinton got a blowjob. That's it.

</quote>

Was that why he lost his legal license for five years? What Clinton did was more than just violate his oath of office, his oath of marriage and oath as an officer of the court. He perjured himself to dishonor a woman in order to save his own political ass. It was wrong. Comparing him to anyone else is irrelevant.

As for Newt, he has too much infidelity/adultery baggage himself to be elected President or Vice-President. I think he's probably shooting for "elder statesman" in the next Republican administration.

I'm sorry, I am usually much more careful. Ask Lone Laugher. I'm aware that Calista is his third wife.

Please stop the pretense that you can dismiss the messy details of Newt's life by attacking the sources.

Newt is a serial adulterer. He left his first wife when she had cancer. She had financial problems because Newt failed to pay her child support. He left his second wife after she was dx with MS. He's on his third marriage. He is not a moral man.

So I should ask one liberal about another liberal getting information wrong? Really?

Again, his daughter tells a different story about the first marriage. and you've gotten so many facts wrong, probably because you get all your info from HuffPo, that it's laughable. I've counted at least six on this thread alone.

You should ask him about me because he knows me.

I rarely read Huffington Post. I'm just a little off today. You'll see. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

And really, you seem to miss the point so often, you might want to tone down the recriminations. KWIM?
