Is it true that Gaddafi wanted to free Africa from Western imperialism by investing $96 Billion dollars to countries, and the reason why the French Imperialists wanted to get rid of him?

One thing that the Imperialists of the West don't want is a developing Africa. Could this be why French Imperialists like Freemasons govern the Ivory Coast? My mum was in Gerba and last year, and she said that she would sit down in the hotel to a meal and French people would turn up in suits and be waited on hand-and-foot before anyone else in the restaurant. She said that French (men it seems) are well respected everywhere. She also said that she saw a Masonic lodge and noticed the French writing above the entrance.

Gadafi wanted to pump billions into the infrastructure of African countries like Niger and Mauritania, including a mosque at Brazzavile in the Congo region.

They got rid of Gaddafi because he was a threat Western Imperalism.

any leader/government which opposes doing things the "western way" is a threat to 'western imperialism'.... the only difference between these opponents is that some are too strong to take on, whilst others can be taken out should the right opportunity arise (i.e. the "arab spring")

Maybe, that's a possibility, albeit one of many. I'll stick to the orthodox perception that the events in Tunisia were dominoesque and Libya was part of the chain. Of course there was a political motive behind Libya; it now means oil companies can strike deals with Libya as it is more approachable now but it has also granted the Libyan people freedom and I don't think there is anything wrong with that. It's hardly imperial in the definitive sense.

This thread is full of utter fruitcakes. Next you'll be saying that overthrowing Hitler was evil American imperialism.

I agree with you up to a point. Of course Ghadaffi was a blood-thirsty dictator and there is no excuse for the way he treated the people of Libya. However, many people in West-Africa, for instance, one of the poorest regions of the world, saw him as a hero because he did more for them than the West ever did. I think one of the motives behind the intervention in Libya might have been the Western world's fear of a united and strong Africa - what with the enormous and young population of most African countries, this would be an economic rival to be reckoned with. A poor, helpless and resourceless Africa is just much more convenient for the West.

I hardly think this was a concern of the west!

So we shouldn't by that logic discuss the historical implications of Stalin, Hitler, Caesar or any other significant figure who happens now to be dead?

It helps the corporative cycle accentuate. I see nothing wrong with that. I don't see Libyan people protesting against NATO for helping them.

$96bn is greater than the entire GDP per annum of Libya.

Embezzling dictator or not, I somehow doubt he ever had $96bn to invest.

</quote>

he controls over $200 billion + of assets.

but that's beside the point. there are many reasons for the intervention by the west, fdi into Africa is not it. Gold dinars. united africa, oil are more likely reasons

To put that in perspective, Bill Gates's net worth is about $56 billion. Do you really think Gaddafi had $40 billion more than Bill Gates?

</quote>

He probably didn't, but to be fair Gadaffi has the money from the country, Bill Gates is just one guy.

Gaddafi was a threat to US world dominance! He wanted to abolish the petrodollar!

Those who manipulate the organized habits and opinions of the masses constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of the country…. It remains a fact in almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by this relatively small number of persons…. As civilization has become more complex, and as the need for invisible government has been increasingly demonstrated, the technical means have been invented and developed by which opinion may be regimented.
