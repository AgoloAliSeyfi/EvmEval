Quite frankly I get more and more embarrassed being an American every year. The concept of sensationalizing the death of a federal judge and the near death of a congress woman, when 18 other people were shot or killed is insane. Could someone tell me what makes the life of an individual holding a public office so much important than anyone else? If public servants are so sacred, why do we send many of them to their deaths in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Syria, Djibouti and Somalia?

I believe this man gets it.

I have issues with people who will always focus on the "embarrassments" of this great nation, yet they will turn a blind eye to the great things this nation has accomplished and the charity this nation has given to countries that are less fortunate than ours. No country is perfect, but this country is far and away better than any other on Earth. For once....try focusing on that and just maybe you won't be so "embarrassed" when it doesn't live up to your expectations.

Unfortunately, I can't bury my head in the sand. This has gotten out of hand. The political leadership that has attributed our government morphing into a plutocracy that is bankrupting this "great nation", moreover it's people. Those who lead us along this path to bankruptcy are not heroes. The true heroes will be the people will have to endure the emanate mass austerity, sovereign default or currency devaluation. The true heroes will be ones that bear the burden of 40 years of political discourse.

When the embarrassments are out-weighing the accomplishments, one should take notice and remove their head from the sand.

Yes, yes you have buried your head in the sand, Sail Away.

And yet cops and firefighters, as emplyees of government, are under attack because of their pay and benefits.
