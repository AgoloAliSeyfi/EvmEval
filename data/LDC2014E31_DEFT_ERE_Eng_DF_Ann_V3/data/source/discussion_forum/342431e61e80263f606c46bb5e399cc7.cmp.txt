And Fox News is covering this story. They're just not in a Race-Baiting feeding frenzy like the Liberal Press is. They're actually being responsible journalists. As more evidence comes out, they will cover the story a bit more.

Then why did HANNITY say the shooting was an accident? Why did fox and friends say it was the victims fault because he wore a hoodie?

Please explain this?

I actually listened to Hannity's radio show today and he said nothing of the sort.

In fact he is all for getting to the bottom of this as quickly as possible... your assertion that Hannity is soft on this is WAY OFF Bud... way off.

It's not a big story. It's only a big story to racist liberals. After all, the two black boys who poured gasoline and set a 13 year old white boy on fire wasn't exactly news to CNN or MSNBC. Black mobs beating up white fair goers at the Wisconsin State Fair never even got a mention. If Fox News doesn't go in for race baiting (and it's not even race since Zimmerman is hispanic), good for them.

Either you're a liar, ignorant of recent history, willfully ignorant, or a pathetic combination of all three.

EVERY situation that you mention was covered by the press (TV, radio, print).... a simple google search will confirm what I say. What you didn't have in those cases were a police force that did a piss poor job of investigating a fatal shooting and a Jeb Bush local law that gave creeps like Zimmerman (with a record of being a 911 nusiance to the police AND a criminal record) credence to do what he did. And then you had this <a href="http://current.com/shows/the-young-turks/videos/in-911-call-does-george-zimmerman-call-trayvon-martin-a-fing-coon">In 911 call, does George Zimmerman call Trayvon Martin a 'f***ing coon'? - The Young Turks with Cenk Uygur // Current TV</a>

Fox Noise resident idiot Hannity try to play it all off as a "mistake"......yeah, after the 911 tape clearly has the cops telling Zimmerman that he does not have to follow Martin, and Zimmerman making all types of wild assumptions while observing a man in the rain at night!

So "hispanics" do not racially discriminate? Puh-leeze!

Fox and Friends said that? Really? That was Geraldo Rivera, who, I am pretty sure, is a complete idiot, and a liberal.

What about the black teens who chased and beat white fairgoers in Wisconsin.
The media didn't touch this story. This was a HUUUGE event. For no apparent reason a group of black teenagers systematically started chasing and hitting white people.
Nothing in the media.
A group of blacks dressed in uniform and carrying clubs outside a voting precinct and the racist liberals excused it. I would have LOVED to see what would have happened if a group of white racist dressed in Aryan militaristic garb carrying clubs outside a voting precinct would have resulted in the media....it would have been headline news for weeks. Or imagine a group of white teens attacking blacks coming out of a church or other gathering....a nuclear bomb could go off and you wouldn't have known it for the wall to wall coverage.
Both the media and liberals act in overt racism on a regular basis and then we have people like MarcATL trying to point the finger the other direction.
What a tool.

the TWO self professed new black panthers that stood outside a polling station were investigated by the cops and it was found that they did NOT threaten or intimidate anyone nor did they belong to any true organization. Had neo-nazis/aryans showed up in a GROUP as you say, then that would have made news because those boys make it known they don't like black folk. The pseudo-panthers claimed they were there to prevent a re-enactment of the nonsense that went on in Florida in 2000.

And all one has to do is a simple google search to see that the Wisconsin incident was covered by TV, radio and print. So either YOU are poor liar or incredibly ignorant as to what's going on around you.

What you had in Florida with Zimmerman was a 911 tape like this <a href="http://current.com/shows/the-young-turks/videos/in-911-call-does-george-zimmerman-call-trayvon-martin-a-fing-coon">In 911 call, does George Zimmerman call Trayvon Martin a 'f***ing coon'? - The Young Turks with Cenk Uygur // Current TV</a>

A guy with a criminal record being told by the cops he doesn't have to follow the man, cops who do a piss poor job of crime scene investigation, the parents trying for 3 days to find out what happened to their kid, and a law that encourages assholes like Zimmerman. It's a perfect storm that subliminal sheet wearers like YOU don't like. TFB.
