We're not going to change their minds. What I meant was why make it easy? I want to be a millionaire but I'm not likely winning the lottery. It's like we handed the terrorists the ticket to make it easy to realize their ambitions.

And we're killing huuuuugely disproportionate amounts of insurgents whereas on 9/11, we were being killed in huuuugely disproportionate amounts. And exactly how did they need to "realize their ambitions"? Two skyscrapers falling sure looked like someones ambitions being realized... or every other thing western countries have done in the middle east...

the way i see it, the insurgency is not in its "last throes", mainly because of the unwillingness of the american public to fight. war is bad, i know that, but sometimes you need it. look at the democratic elections. iraq has a government. sure, it is unstable, but that's why we need to stay. thier security forces are being trained. i watched a press confrince a while back that showed the numbers of iraqi security forces, and they are growing. i don't feel like doing research, but i think thier numbers are in the 100000 neighborhood. there are 30 (50?) some regiments, where as in 2 years ago there were 2 or 3. again, don't quote me, but those are close enough. i plan to enlist, hopefully enter west point. i am willing to fight, and die. i don't want to, but if my country needs me, i will. i am not gung-ho, and i am not some punk that thinks rambo movies are an accurite discription of war. i think war is like that first part of saving privat ryan. remember that, it looked like hell. i am not excited about it, but i want to do something to make the world a better place. if you have a son/daughter fighting in Iraq, then i wish him/her well and hope he/she gets back safely. remember, they were not drafted, it is an all voulnteer army. if they didn't want to fight, they have that choice. i am glad that soldiers choose to be soldiers, because someone needs to do it, until the end of time.
again, i will stop because i tend to ramble.

Fibster, what you posted was heart felt and touching. I am glad soldiers choose to be soldiers too. However, in gratitude we should not squander their lives--we should not send them to fight except as necessary to defend our country. I am standing up for them, as are other Americans. And when our country is against war, politicians should take heed of this.

Would a terrorist say "you know, I'm in a democracy. Screw the bomb, I'm throwing it away. I'm going to college!"

Right!!!

The goverment type could change but the PEOPLE there in the region won't...

If we weren't there would there be many "insurgents" to kill? How many of these disproportianate ammount that we slaughtered needed to be slaughtered? How many rose up agains America because they were there rather than because they had an inveterate animosity towards USA AND would have attacked and carried it out successfully. Not many. So USA is killing who needs to be killed BECAUSE USA is there

You seem to have a very narrow minded view of the world. The government of Iraq was like, say, teh Russian government of the past (Soviet Union). They controlled everything and all information was filtered or simply created. If people knew the REAL west, as through a democracy, they might stand down. They will then realize that the lies they were fed that made them hate hte US so much were in fact that, lies.

And your second opinion needs some factual backing. What statistic or fact can you cite that shows the US is killing people that dont need to be killed (and no, sending a mass emailing to an insurgent group shooting back at you doesnt cut it in Iraq)?

I gave you the website on another thread where we talked about this. It was one of those 'is this a lie' website like factcheck.org or snopes or snoopers or whatever its called.

Check that, heres the url. <a href="http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/r/rayreynolds.htm">http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/r/rayreynolds.htm</a>

And i dont really think we can put much of a price tag on 25 million people freed... and your post is confusing, how do you win the war on terrorism by increasing our own education statistics? We dont win by being narcassitic...

Now wheres my penguin hug :D

Dang, im in that big reply box but theres no spell check.... gigidygigidygoo!

25 million people freed? Don't you think this could have be done without paying such a high price, including many people who have died? Did we preserve freedom for Americans? No--that means we are not defending our country. And we won't win anything by shoving our beliefs down people's throats.

BTW, I know you've selected "advanced" to reply before, so you should know this gives you options to spell check, quote, etc. If you don't want to look like you're illiterate...
