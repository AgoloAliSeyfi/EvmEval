This actually seems to be the prevailing attitude at a few Penn State message boards I've lurked at. That not one person who approves of Joe's firing is anything more than jealous of his success or is just reveling at seeing an icon fall. In fact, I've seen multiple cases of people saying things like "We will rise above this" and genuinely portraying this entire scandal as a concentrated attack against for Penn State. Everyone's just jealous of how awesome they are, and will stop at nothing!

There are a fair amount of people arguing - seriously - that most of the anger about the case is about people not being Penn State fans. There is a lot of claims that this is nothing more but some giant conspiracy between the media and anti Penn Staters to bring them down. There are many people acting like this entire scandal is about nothing more than malicious efforts to bring down Penn State because of how awesome they are. They are painting themselves (school, faculty, and fans) as the real victims in all this.

The big argument they are using is that Joe and McQueary both reported the incident to their superiors, and that going to the police would have been wrong because they would be undermining their superiors. They are literally saying that going above one's superiors is worse than going to the police once one's superiors take action.

What gets me is that there are people not just excusing Paterno and McQueary's actions as understandable human foibles, but are actually praising them. I have seen large numbers of Penn State cheerleaders saying that it is wisdom and maturity to not go to the police but instead count on one's superiors to handle things directly and defer to their determinations (such as not pressing charges or going to the police).

While they all seem to agree that the superiors are at fault for not reporting it, Paterno and McQueary are to be commended simply for reporting it and then doing the "appropriate" thing by not undermining their superior's decision.

And I've seen variants of this line about a million times by now:

"I really feel sorry for people with such hate in their hearts that they feel the need to go after Papa Joe after (list professional accomplishments of Paterno). Paterno did what he was supposed to, and still has said that he is sorry he didn't do more. As a Christian, I pity all these hateful critics and I will pray for them."

Also, Penn State fans are being encouraged to wear white to the next game in order to protest the persecution of Paterno and express their support.

Wow, this is pretty appalling. Fanboys will always be fanboys, but for a pedophile-enabler? Unbelievable. And it's not like he's even going to jail, he just got fired. Boo ******* hoo.

"Did what he was supposed to do"... wow, I hope these tards are never witness to any kind of crime or assault on my person, because I know I could never count on them for help.

I just don't get this.

McQueary tells JoePa that he saw "something inappropriate of sexual nature" between Sandusky and a 10 year old kid. And Paterno says, "Ok, thank you for that, have a nice day" and tells the AD?

That doesn't make any sense. He doesn't say, "What do you mean, "inappropriate"? What exactly did you see?"

This was an act supposedly by his best buddy, happening right in his lockerrooms, and he doesn't ask for ANY details to find out precisely what the guy was talking about? I said it before, this was Paterno's football program, and he is responsible for stuff going on within it. He can't pass the buck and say, "Don't look at me, I told my boss."
[...]
But no, he acts as if he got a memo from the McQueary and forwarded it on to his superiors like he was supposed to.

It just doesn't make sense. If that is what he did, he totally ignored the severity of the accusation, if not legally, but absolutely in terms of the impact it could have on his football program.

Yeah, the more I think about it, the more I believe that not only did Paterno fail miserably at handling the case, but he was possibly completely aware of what was going but was just protecting his buddy. I can't prove this, obviously, but when you gather all the facts, it paints a likelier story, IMO. Anyway, he's either a completely incompetent coward, or a lowlife scumbag protecting his child-raping friend.

He didn't look away and he did have empathy for the victim. 28 years old sounds old but it isn't. That he was a graduate assistant suggests he had been in school basically his whole life. Students, employees and young people in general learn to defer serious problems to their superiors, whose jobs are to resolve them.

Mike McQueary is an interesting case in that he was practically raised to be a part of the Penn State family. Son of prominent local businessman, star quarterback for the local schools, eventually Penn State quarterback. If there was ever someone destined to spend their life on the sidelines with Paterno, it was him.
