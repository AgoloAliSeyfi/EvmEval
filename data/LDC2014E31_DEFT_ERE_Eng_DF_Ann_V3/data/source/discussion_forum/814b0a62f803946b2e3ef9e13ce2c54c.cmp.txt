I like how free speech rights all point to protecting objectionable speech. Free Speech was meant to protect a political minority from the majority in getting their message heard. It was not meant to protect pornographers, hate speech against a minority or politically motivated attacks on a small group of private citizens, who are not even part of that discussion.

Some speech is simply unnecessary to the ends of a political debate. I expect that the ruling will fall on the time tested principle of liberty up to the point it displaces the liberty of another.

Pornography has value to many/most people, and the line between art and obscenity is impossible to draw. "Hate speech" is a form of political speech...just a revolting one. We do not restrict speech merely because it is revolting.

It is very very very hard to muzzle an American. Would you have that change, saveliberty?

I want the WBC to disappear as well, but this seems to me the wrong way to go about it. I doubt their finances can withstand scrutiny...why not instead attack their tax free status?

Calling for people to commit crimes against a group is hate speech.

Basically it's a kind of incitment to riot and it ought to be illegal.

There has to be a present risk of harm, editec. Reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on first amendment rights are constitutional, but only if they pass muster on this point.

And those already existing time place and manner restrictions were utilized at Matthew Snyder's funeral, with the result that the family never even knew WBC was there. So why do we need broad new restrictions on speech, or liability expanded for speech, when existing restrictions already work?

Apparently the restrictions did not work as harm was done. It was proven in a lower court by a judge. Granted that was overruled in a higher court, that is how we got here. I highly doubt the Supreme Court took this case, only to agree with the appeals decision. A narrow ruling with a ban on political speech focused on a private individual without a political opinion on the speech in question does no harm. In this case, the soldier was the private individual and could not speak in his own defense. I think something about private events that have no reasonable expectation of being completely out of the public might be part of it.

A lot of people think there are only tow ways to deal with something. The right way to deal with the idiots that make up the WBC is to allow them to say whatever they want, secure in the knowledge that we, as a country, are not represented by them.

The wrong way is to pass laws in an attempt to limit "hate" speech, or hope that the Supreme Court finds some twisted logic to justify shutting them down.

The American way is to step out and who them, and the people they are protesting, how we feel about them.

We don't need the government to protect us from hate.

WBC is getting sued by a grieving parent. What the fuck law or act (of Congress or of a state) is even implicated?

Freedom of speech has never been understood to restrict the ability of people to sue other people for things like libel and slander. It cannot be properly understood in that way, in fact. Only the so-called "1st Amendment 'absolutists'" think in such ridiculous terms.

So if a citizen can sue another citizen over something said or written, then why can't a citizen sue another citizen for the intentional infliction of emotional injury caused by the outrageous CONDUCT of the party getting sued? If the plaintiff succeeds in the lawsuit at the SCOTUS level, there will have been ZERO violation of the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech.

The fucking scumbags of WBC will merely have had their depraved, disgusting and outrageous behavior properly called into account. They remain perfectly free to express their idiotic beliefs either way.

Fuck them. God hates them. I know. HE told me so. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cool.gif"/>

I have to admit, after listening to the opposing arguments on NPR last evening, that I am starting to agree with your point of view in this instance.
