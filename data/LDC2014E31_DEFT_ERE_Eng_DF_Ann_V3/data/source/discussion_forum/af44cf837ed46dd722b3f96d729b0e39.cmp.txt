Actually, Warren was appointed to the congressional oversight panel by Senate Majority leader Harry Reid, not by either the Bush43 or Obama administrations.

Unless galveston had some other appointment of hers in mind.

[quote=Bryan Ekers;14106958]What do you mean, "intent aside" ? That's like saying "death aside, what's the big deal about murder?"

And I remain curious about how and when (and indeed if) the government (let alone specifically Clinton or ACORN) did this.

The intent part? You have heard the old saying "The road to Hell is paved with good intentions? Good intentions and a dollar will get you a cup of coffee, maybe.

I'm not doing your homework for you. I would give you the proper name of the act, but it was something like "The Affordable Housing Act" (probably not exactly right) passed during the Carter administration, revived by the Clinton administration, and bore bitter fruit near the end of the Bush administration. In Fact GW tried to get congress to reign in Fanny and Freddy, but no dice. ACORN's part was to push this for all it was worth to get loans for as many disadvantaged people as possible.

For a smart guy, you don't seem to be very well informed.

I stand corrected on Reid. Sometimes during those times Reid, Pelosi and Obama kind of run together.

Do you remember the checks that were sent out to individuals? I got one. Whose economy got stimulated? Well, I guess mine did a little. Did folks go out and buy something they didn't need, or did they just pay bills? Electronics, jewelry, etc? Where were those products made? Mostly not in the USA. We stimulated economies, primarily foreign. The same thing happened with the "cash for clunkers". People bought Toyotas, Mazdas, &amp; Volkswagens, with a smattering of Fords and Chevys.

That is why stimulus should be invested in infrastructure. Can't be outsourced, employment increases, the money is multiplied in local economies, and the country gets physical improvements.

What worked fantastically well until 1937? My wife's parents would have argued with you strenuously were they still alive, as I suspect many parents or grandparents who lived through the Great Depression would have.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession_of_1937%E2%80%931938">Recession of 1937Â–1938</a>
<quote orig_author="galveston">
By the spring of 1937, production, profits, and wages had regained their 1929 levels. Unemployment remained high, but it was considerably lower than the 25% rate seen in 1933. In June 1937, some of Roosevelt's advisors urged spending cuts to balance the budget. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration">WPA</a> rolls were drastically cut and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works_Administration">PWA</a> projects were slowed to a standstill. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession_of_1937%E2%80%931938#cite_note-2">[3]</a> The American economy took a sharp downturn in mid-1937, lasting for 13 months through most of 1938. Industrial production declined almost 30 per cent and production of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durable_good">durable goods</a> fell even faster.

Unemployment jumped from 14.3% in 1937 to 19.0% in 1938, rising from 5 million to more than 12 million in early 1938. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession_of_1937%E2%80%931938#cite_note-3">[4]</a> Manufacturing output fell by 37% from the 1937 peak and was back to 1934 levels. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession_of_1937%E2%80%931938#cite_note-4">[5]</a> Producers reduced their expenditures on durable goods, and inventories declined, but personal income was only 15% lower than it had been at the peak in 1937. In most sectors, hourly earnings continued to rise throughout the recession, which partly compensated for the reduction in the number of hours worked. As unemployment rose, consumers' expenditures declined, leading to further cutbacks in production.
