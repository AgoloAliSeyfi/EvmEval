An adult having sex with a minor is legally rape.
A man having sex with a minor is taking. A woman having sex with a minor boy is taking by giving, providing satisfaction.

I think this is a good point. Children are devalued in most western cultures. We all learn at home and in school that adults are to be given the benefit of the doubt, while children are not. Most of us are prepared to discipline children at the drop of a hat, but there are a lot more cultural rules to be followed when confronting other adults.

You seem to have missed his point.

You know, not that I'm excusing it in any way, but I can understand the Catholic apologetics like Donahue in the wake of the RCC scandal, because the RCC is founded on religious beliefs. People are afraid of the word of the Church Jesus or God being undermined, so they rush in with the support of people who failed to act as an attempt to preserve their faith. I may think it's terrible, but at least I can wrap my brain around their mentality.

But football? People let this continue for years, and now fans are showing outpourings of support towards Paterno, because of football?

I really agree with this. Here is an article that expands:

<quote>
Its connected to the Bowl Championship Series, conference realignment and all the ways in which college football has morphed over the last generation into a multibillion-dollar big business. This isnt about Sandusky. This is about about a culture that says the football team must be defended at all costs: a culture where the sexual assault of a 10-year-old is reported to Paterno before the police.

This is what happens when a football program becomes the economic and spiritual heartbeat of an entire section of a state. The Nittany Lions football regularly draws 100,000 fans to Happy Valley. They also produce $50 million in pure profit for the University every year and has been listed as the most valuable team in the Big 10 conference. Another economic report held that every Penn State game pumps $59 million into the local economy: from hotels to kids selling homemade cookies by the side of the road. Its no wonder that Paterno is revered. He took a football team and turned it into an economic life raft for a university and a region. When something becomes that valuable, a certain mindset kicks in. Protect the team above all over concerns. Protect Joe Pa. Protect Nittany Lions football. Protect the brand. In a company town, your first responsibility is to protect the company.

The love was evident as several hundred students crowded around Paterno's house, located just a couple of blocks from campus. Chants of "We are Penn State!" and "Joe Paterno!" filled an otherwise quiet, darkened street.

And note that Sandusky "retired" right after that incident, in the prime of his career when he was a shoo-in to get a head coaching job. Speculation today is the retirement was forced because PSU knew he was a child molester, yet they allowed him to use their facilities for his football camp for troubled children.

----------------------------------------------------------

There was a scandal at Notre Dame last year that created a lot of furor locally (I don't think it got much national news attention) where an unidentified athlete was accused of sexually assaulting a freshman girl. The university waited 2 weeks before contacting the South Bend police, by which time the alleged victim had committed suicide. That actually looks well-handled in comparison to the PSU scandal.

Well-handled?

To revisit this: I think you're off your rocker. I can't conceive of a single instance of an adult "having anal sex with" a ten-year-old that would not qualify as an assault, nor can I imagine what makes you think that there's any kind of circumstance which would render such a rape not in need of immediate intervention if such is possible. In retrospect, this is one of the most abhorrent posts I've ever had the pleasure of reading on this forum.

It seems to me that people up and down the chain of command have violated the Cleary Act. Every time someone on my campus is mugged, rather a lot, now I that I think about it, the campus police release a report of the incident and highlight the cleary act in the subject line. This full disclosure is federal law, and if it was not acted on at Penn State, well, yikes. The Chronicle of Higher Ed reports that the Education Dept. is now investigating.

By comparison.

The furor over ND was that they waited 2 weeks to notify the police (or properly counsel the victim), while PSU never did. Were it not for the 2009 complaint that brought on the Grand Jury investigation I doubt they'd ever have said anything.
