I chose this, my favorite thread, to make my 20,000th post. I want to underscore the statement by Martin Luther King, quoted immediately above. This thread is a sort of revival of one run be me and Joanne Dorel on Abuzz, right before we came over to Able2Know. I want to thank all of you who participated and also Craven for giving us the opportunity.

My impression of the so called peace movement is of a self-indulgent generation addicted to drugs and easy answers, but very adverse to constructive work or personal accountability. Not much there that looks admirable to me even in retrospect.

My most memorable direct contact with such advocates was when they dropped garbage and worse on the decks of our carriers sailing out of the Golden Gate for tours of duty in WestPac and the Gulf of Tonkin. They didn't appear so noble to us then.

I have memories of this, but nostalgia is not the word for them.

They were a diverse mix of people. Just as I am sure you didn't create a massacer of innocent villagers over there like William Calley did, we didn't all do those things you accuse us of. We could go tit for tat over and over. My side did this; your side did that. In the end it proves only partisanship.

I didn't accuse you or anyone of anything. I did observe the insulting banners hung from the Golden gate bridge and the offal and garbade dropped on us as we passed under., Happily their aim and windage corrections wasn't that good and much of the material missed us, but enough of it hit for us to know what it was.

War is indeed a terrible thing and one shouldn't indulge in it either lightlly or to feed the vanity of self-proclaimed intellectual strategists. However it was these people in the Democrat Kennedy and Johnson administrations who got us into this war. The sad fact was they lacked the wisdom and the balls to get us through it successfully, wasting many lives, American and Vietnamese in the process.

My strong impression was that the principal motivating factor on college campuses was the draft, and not any altruistic opposition to war. It was all very sophomoric and all quite futile. The only demonstrable result of our political loss to the North Vietnamese Communists and subsequent abandonment of the Government of South Vietnam, was the sacrifice of the Vietnamese people to a generation of poverty and tyranny under a very backward and oppressive regime. Apart from the PRK and Myanmar (Burma) also ruled by authoritarian regimes, Vietnam and Cambodia are the poorest and most backward nations in Asia. So much for the hugh-minded agrarian reformers that this misguided and pampered generation of self-indulgent Americans imagined were leading the opposition in Vietnam.

Again, I say, there were differing reasons, as there were differing people on both sides. Some who went to war didn't want to go, but felt they could not disobey. For them, the morality or lack of it was not the question. Obeying orders was. Others believed in it so strongly they reupped to go again. My brother refused to be sent because "I'm not going to fight somebody else's war." I protested it on grounds of morality. Some refused to go because they didn't want to be killed. You are not accusing anyone, but you are accusing people anyway. Kennedy and Johnson had the balls to start a war, but couldn't win it. Nixon expanded the war, having balls the size of watermellons, and got that many more needlessly killed. In no way was he better on the question of the war than Johnson. Only difference, Johnson came to recognize the futility and left office with the situation such that his successor could end the fighting. Nixon's "secret plan to end the war" was to bomb them into submission, among other things and he ignored Johnson's moves. Too bad they didn't remove him from office his first year.

We had been "bombing them into submission for four years under Johnson, The problem was we were bombing the wrong things. Johnson MacNamara and the self-styled "intellectuals" running the show refused to allow us to bomb surface-to-air missiles being unloaded from Soviet Ships in Haiphong, or to simply close the harbor by mining it - or even to bomb the missiles in various central locations where they were being assembled.. Instead we were directed to wait until the missiles were assembled and operational, and then directed to attack them - costing us hundreds of aircraft, many lives and prisioners. Nixon quickly closed the port of Haiphong by mining it and in a brief intensive bombing campaign exhausted the air defenses around Hanoi - in the last days we could fly anywhere at will without much opposition. Sadly, by then we had already lost the political war on the streets and campuses of the United States. A generation of unfortunate Vietnamese have paid the price for that madness.
