Your map doesn't say that much to be honest.

Iran has gained immensely beyond their wildest dreams from the removal of their old enemy Saddam and the installation of a Shia government that is very much influenced by Iran in Iraq. In Afghanistan, Iranian special forces fought alongside the Americans to capture Herat in the early stages of the war and the Taliban were long a foe of the Iranian regime, they were close to invading all the way through the 1990s. Of all the countries in the region, Iran has gained the most by American interventions. It is the Saudis who lost out because they lost their buffer with Iran in Iraq.

It shows the American bases primed to attack Iran. Regardless of collaboration between Iranian and Americans, the situation has now changed, for the worse.

You do realise that these mullahs want to be bombed. They will use it as an excuse to abuse the Iranian people even more.

Well in my opinion they're both the terrorists in more ways than one. Regardless you can't defend Iran for the fact that it hasn't invaded another country in a couple centuries seeing as using proxies is technically the same.

I'm not saying that Iran is the "good angel" in all this but just suggesting that people should put things into perspective. Like:

(1) No evidence has been found of Nuclear weapons.

(2) Iran has complied LEGALLY with every IAEA request.

(3) Whilst all the fuss has been made that Iran supports "terrorist" groups, no one has made a pipsqueak that America continues to support the Bahrani and Saudi regime who are crushing down on their own protesters with weapons supplied by America itself.

I don't understand what you mean, Iran is not part of Arabia, Arabia is just the Arabian peninsula, I'm confused I have no idea what you're on about and Iran is no more an Arab country than the UK is one. Iran wouldn't be under threat if it didn't have such a hostile approach towards Israel and the US. It's feeding them and giving them more reasons to beat the war-drums and making itself more prone to invasion. The US bases around Iran would pose no threat to it if it's fanatical leaders didn't keep baiting Israel.

Let's get this down to the nuts and bolts:

Who is the problem in the Middle East? Muslims or Jews

<quote>
...and the Iranian regime are supplying Hamas, Hezbollah to do their dirty work for them and keep poking Israel. Funding Assad to shoot his own people so it can have a like-minded dictatorial neighbour so they can happily defeat the Great Satan that is America with complete indifference to the position of its own people. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that two wrongs don't make a right.

Maybe if the US stopped backing and cosying up to the Saudi's, maybe we'll get a more positive reaction from Russia and China who have been vetoing military action.

Or and let's again puts things into perspective:

Rockets vs Tanks - Which one is worse?
Planes vs Mortars - Which one is worse?

And you seem to be under the misapprehension that Hizbullah instigates wars when they are the self-defending party which couldn't be said the same for the Saudi's.

An attack on Israel is very very unlikely. The Israelis know this. However the worry of a nuclear Iran is not that it would attack Israel but the other consequences and destabilisation that would come with a nuclear armed Iran.

As for attacking nations does that really matter when they have constantly been supporting terrorist groups throughout the middle east as well as supporting dictatorship in Syria?

</quote>

For the third time now please could you tell me when was the last time Iran have attacked or bombed another nation? The Israeli Prime Minister did state to Obama, "The Jewish state will not allow those who seek our destruction the means to achieve that goal. A nuclear armed Iran must be stopped". The do seem adamant that Iran would aim nukes at them!

Wouldn't a pre-emptitve strike that be illegal under international law or something?

Oh wait! I forget. Israel has never been good in following laws. Such a shame that they then turn around and claim another country (Iran) should not do what is essentially allowed of them under the law. i.e - possess nuclear technology.

</quote>

basically same as what i think. I dont condone the political situation in Iran nor their stance on nuclear weapons but it is legal for them to have nuclear power. They have said they dont want a bomb.
