This morning I was watching "Good Day New York" on Channel 5, which is part of the FOX network. The co-host were interviewing a guy who is part of the on-going occupation of Wall St., and were (of course) repeating the media standard line by questioning the man as to why there is no set goals or leadership to advocate such goals. During his response, the man pointed out that it's about all types of people pointing out that nothing is being done about the economic inequality and subsequent crimes perpetrated by Wall St./banking giants (individuals and corporations)....and that you had leaders from various backgrounds join in. He stated that Al Sharpton "a self made man from the streets like me" was joining.....at which time co-host Greg Kelly interjected (twice) that like Al Sharpton, Rupert Murdoch is a self made man.

<img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/confused.gif"/> Come again?

Rupert Murdoch INHERITED HIS FATHER'S OWNERSHIP OF TWO NEWSPAPERS IN THE U.K. (Australia). He did NOT start out in the copy room of some local city paper and work his way up to mogul.

Al Sharpton grew up doing the preacher circuit for his particular brand of religion. Big difference.

I saw this as just another Fox flunkie pushing the "class warfare" line that's heard from the neocon/teabagger pundits in the media. By trying to equate Murdoch as a successful "every man", co-host Greg Kelly pushes the subliminal context that the Wall St. protesters are just "jealous" of "successful people".

Typical Fox BS....but not unexpected.

What the hell does that bolded part mean? Anybody?

I forgot how willfully ignorant and purposely obtuse you can be, Cali-Girl. Let me dumb it down for you: Murdoch was born into the American equivalent of upper middle-class....the next best thing to being "old money". So he had ADVANTAGES from birth...he did NOT have to work his way up the ladder or beat his brains to get a scholarship. So the comparison to Sharpton as a "self made man" is a crock. Got that, bunky?

It means that after inheriting two small nondescript newspapers, Murdoch turned those into a media empire and is a self-made mad. The parasitic class at OWS just want everything for nothing. They are having fun at the expense of New York. They get to take drugs, drink, have lots of anonymous sex in the filth they produce and no one can touch them. This is the life!

And here we have yet another neocon/teabagger parrot squawking loudly about something he knows absolutely NOTHING about.

The Sunday Mail and The News in Australia were anything BUT "small, nondescript" newspapers....case in point, the Sunday Mail, an Australian mainstay, has been around for 90 years, so they were obviously doing okay before little Rupert came along....I do wish these Limbaugh wanna-be's would do their homework honestly sometimes, because I get tired of doing it for them.

My opening posts stands valid.

Fox News is more balanced than CNN,NBC,or NPR. There are far more Liberals/Socialists who appear regularly on Fox News than do Conservatives on CNN,NBC,or NPR. It has actually been studied and proven that Fox News is more 'Fair &amp; Balanced' than the Liberal Press is. So i can't agree with the OP's paranoid conspiracy thinking on this one.

Still waiting for TackyLiberal to explain what 'in the UK (Australia)' means. Australia is not in the UK.

I stand corrected. Now, do YOU have the cojones to deal with the FACTS that back up my opening posts point regarding the idiotic comparison of Murdoch to Sharpton as "self made men"?

Don't hate your fellow Americans. Being a success is a good thing. Don't be jealous and bitter. That only leads to hate and violence. God has a plan for us all. Stay true to him and he will stay true to you. Some Politicians are now just preying on human weakness. They are promoting this Class Envy/Class Warfare stuff to get and hang onto power. It's not healthy for our nation. Turning American against American is just wrong. A house divided will surely fall.

Okay folks, this clown is obviously just some wonk who feels he has to keep things rolling by just parroting right wingnut mantras of Levin or Limbaugh or Hannity or Beck...... just ignore this "paluitician".

He inherited 2 regional Australian newspapers from his father. How outrageous! A kid inheriting the family business... albeit a pretty small one.

</quote>

probably a lot more than Sharpton inherited.
Yes, Murdoch is a self made man, but he came from a little better back ground.

From a couple of little newspapers in Australia to a global media empire. Yea, I'd say that qualifies as 'self made'. But I am more interested in when Australia became part of the UK. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> Was it before or after the 1,000 countries suddenly appeared on the globe? Inquiring minds need to know.

Seems the dumber the neocon/teabaggers are, the louder and prouder they are. Someone clue this Cali-girl clown about the history of the Sunday Mail. Inheriting two newspapers of that circulation is a hell of a lot more than working the local preacher circuit in the USA.
