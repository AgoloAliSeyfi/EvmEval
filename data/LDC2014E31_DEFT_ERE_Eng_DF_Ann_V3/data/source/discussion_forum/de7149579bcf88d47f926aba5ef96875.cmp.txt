Unfortunately don't have the time/inclination to read all 200+ replies here esp as I have read and replied to others elsewhere, but here is what I posted in the sports forum (and elsewhere):

Paterno heard an allegation. He reported it and I suspect was very skeptical about it, which at the time wasn't so unreasonable, as he THOUGHT he knew Sandusky well, so he didn't do more. In hindsight, he could've/should've, but it's easy to say now. To burn him for getting thrown into the middle of this and in such a rush is BS IMO.

If they're going to cruxify Paterno, then they better do the same to EVERYONE who "knew." That includes people at that charity the guy worked for and who knows how many others. But that won't happen. Know why? Nobody cares about the nobodies. They care about big splashy revenge, and burning an icon like Paterno goes a long way to that. "Look we got PATERNO! How's that for a big counter-strike?" Nothing like the satisfaction of revenge...you go mob, put another body on the bonfire and don't care if it's really justified or not, long as the blood lust is served. That is what bothers me about this. Not only do I disagree but I esp disagree with it being done in such haste. Let's not carefully review this or realize how ultra-sensitive this is and so tempers are running high meaning rational calculated thought is not exactly in top form.....nahhh let's just BURN people and how dare anyone disagree for even a second?

Down the road I may change my mind on this but right now IMO this is BS. Paterno told the people he was supposed to tell and they were supposed to handle it. It is not his fault they didn't. He wasn't Sandusky's employer or the GA's daddy/wet nurse. PS again I am not saying he's faultless and even he said he could have/should have done more, but it's easy to be self-righteous in hindsight and from a distance and again I think it was so extreme he doubted its validity which is why he didn't go further. Fautless? No. A villian who should get axed? No. Burn the people who were supposed to handle it and who Paterno rightfully thought were.

Well, the Uni is apparently canning everyone who knew and "just passed it on", so you're getting that part of your wish.

And, no, his responsibility was not to report sexual assault to a superior. He's Joe Pa and he controlled that area and everyone knew he controlled it. His responsibility, even legally, was to report it to the law and allow them to investigate it. Being the God of Happy Valley does not abrogate your responsiibilities to society.

You'll have to show evidence that Paterno thought someone else was handling it. And then you'll have to show evidence that he had no vision, hearing or sensibility because he seems to have not noticed that the police didn't show up on campus.

A contract, even with Football U., cannot contravene the law. Any clause that states that is illegal and invalid, so he can't even hide behind his employment agreement.

He should've reported it. He's a football coach, not law enforcement, judge and jury.

Are you sure?

This is an allegation of raping a child, you do not just pass that on and forget it. What did the law say at the time, as his supervisor, the law normally states you must report it to the police, not just pass it up the line.

It certainly seems like they're head hunting when Joe Paterno is fired and Mike McQueary whose inactions I find more reprehensible than Joe's hasn't been fired yet.

Generally when a coach gets fired his staff goes too. I think McQueary will be gone shortly.

The whole rotten bunch needs to go or the stench will cling to PSU.
