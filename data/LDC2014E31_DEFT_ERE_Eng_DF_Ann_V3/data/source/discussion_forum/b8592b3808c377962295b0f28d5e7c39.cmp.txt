Could you explain it in terms a non-wall street financier would understand, Mr. Sallow? What would a 'ton of liquidity' be?

</quote>

Several trillion dollars of cold hard cash.

A company that has reduced its labor force from 110,000 workers to 105,000 workers through attrition, still has obligations sometimes for 35 or 40 years after they retire to maintain their pension and insurance needs after working for 25 years and receiving an early retirement.

Sometimes what looks like a ton of liquidity may not seem so on the flip side of the coin.

And if it is popular to trash big businesses to rob their assets for "others more worthy" than the people who earned this money for the corporations, that is quite a change from America's former habit of rewarding those who earned the money, not those who spent a lifetime training themselves to hone in on what appears to them to look like a big stash of "free money." If you take that "free money" and give it all to somebody else, you will leave 105,000 people who did earn the money with no financial future.

Something seems wrong with the picture I'm seeing of pouncing on the assets of other people and using the government to go after it.

Companies have been saying for at least two years that they aren't hiring because the economy is unstable. No one believes them no matter how many times they try to tell the people.

If business feels that obama will lose the election they will find that a sign of returning stability and star hiring.

Massive layoffs started during the last administration. I saw it in the tech sector.

Was the economy stable then? Or volatile?

Gosh..no thoughts on this?

My thought is that there is work out there for those that want it, and are useful enough to go get it, wherever it is.
I can't imagine sitting on my ass crying about any president affecting my getting a job.

These are just musings..but lately there's been alot of frenzied activity from recruiters. And I just went to the office party of my old job and while talking to some of the guys there, many people who were looking for a year or more are getting snapped up.

What's going on?

Well aside from the economy getting better, the Bush tax cuts are set to expire. And there's not much evidence they did anything to help. Employers are sitting on tons and tons of liquidity and playing "shell games" to keep making money..without adding to the overall economy. Given the present anger in the public at large, I have a feeling that to quell some of this..there will be a hiring boom.

I don't think you'll see a "Hiring boom" till after the 2012 elections and that would depend greatly on the outcome.

</quote>

What exactly are you basing this on?

On another blog several years ago I said corporations wouldn't be hiring for a while for a number of reasons.

-They wanted to cut benefits and wages.
-They wanted to make the President look bad to loosen regulations or get another guy in office.

That position got slammed..but it turned out to be pretty true.

</quote>

They aren't hiring. But not for the reasons you state. You imaginarium is running along the paranoid lines. I've seen many small business owners interviewed and have listened to many who are members here on this board..

A. Thousands of anti business regulations from obama

B. obama care and the associated costs.

c. Uncertainty in an anti business enviornment.

D. They're not look forward to the expiration of the Bush tax cuts.

so,, we'll wait and see who is right.

Well, despite all the ranting and back and forth about this policy or that policy creating jobs, or not creating jobs, or stimulating the economy, not stimulating the economy,

ultimately time alone will move the business cycle along,

and it's been a long time since we've had robust growth.

and why would an employer hire new employees that he may have to lay off later and then know he's going to have to pay unemployment benefits for a lifetime? who in the hell would knowingly do that?
