This year (and last) the cooling over the NE US and Europe has been due to blocking highs because the rest of the arctic has been so much warmer. If anything it shows that global warming is more likely to cause harsher winters in Europe, NE US and NW Russia.

fancy that - just what the scientists said...

Summary
While 2009 showed a slowdown in the rate of annual air temperature increases in the Arctic, the first half of 2010 shows a near record pace with monthly anomalies of over 4°C in northern Canada. There continues to be significant excess heat storage in the Arctic Ocean at the end of summer due to continued near-record sea ice loss. There is evidence that the effect of higher air temperatures in the lower Arctic atmosphere in fall is contributing to changes in the atmospheric circulation in both the Arctic and northern mid-latitudes. Winter 2009-2010 showed a new connectivity between mid-latitude extreme cold and snowy weather events and changes in the wind patterns of the Arctic; the so-called Warm Arctic-Cold Continents pattern.
The annual mean air temperature for 2009 over Arctic land areas was cooler than in recent years, although the average temperature for the last decade remained the warmest in the record beginning in 1900 (Fig. A.1). The 2009 average was dominated by very cold temperatures in Eurasia in February (the coldest of the decade) and December, while the remainder of the Arctic remained warm (Fig. A.2). The spatial distribution of annual temperature anomalies for 2009 has a pattern with values greater than 2.0°C throughout the Arctic, relative to a 196896 reference period (Fig. A.3). These anomalies show the major feature of current Arctic conditions, where there is a factor of two (or more) amplification of air temperature relative to lower latitudes.

and further

Winter 2009-2010 showed a major new connectivity between Arctic climate and mid-latitude severe weather, compared to the past. Figure A7a shows normal early winter atmospheric conditions with low geopotential heights of constant pressure surfaces over the Arctic (purples). These fields indicate the tendency of wind patterns: winds tend to blow counter clockwise around the centers of lower heights, parallel to the height contours. In Figure A7a for example, winds tend to blow from west to east, thus separating cold arctic air masses from the regions further south.
In December 2009 (Fig. A7b) and February 2010 (Fig. A7c ) we actually had a reversal of this climate pattern, with higher heights and pressures over the Arctic that eliminated the normal west-to-east jet stream winds. This allowed cold air from the Arctic to penetrate all the way into Europe, eastern China, and Washington DC. As a result, December 2009 and February 2010 exhibited extremes in both warm and cold temperatures with record-setting snow across lower latitudes. Northern Eurasia (north of 50° latitude to the Arctic coast) and North America (south of 55° latitude) were particularly cold (monthly anomalies of -2°C to -10°C). Arctic regions, on the other hand, had anomalies of +4°C to +12°C. This change in wind directions is called the Warm Arctic-Cold Continents climate pattern. The most extreme winter (December, January, February) Arctic high-pressure event in 145 years of the historical record occurred in Winter 2009-2010.

Too many pages to go through...has anybody discussed about supposedly the Gulf Loop current is stopping? Could not find any real news - only some videos and items in discussion boards...

It depends. The Gulf current is a wind driven effect and since the prevailing winds that cause it are ultimately caused by the spin of the earth. IOW the Gulf Stream shutting down simply isnt possible.

What can happen is that if the salinity of the water in the arctic decreases the point at gulf stream subsides (sinks into the deep ocean) can move southward. Were this to happen much of northern Europe and North America currently warmed by these waters would instead be cooled by arctic waters.

This is one of the leading candidates for the sharp cooling event called the Younger Dryas that occurred about 13000 years ago. In that case its believed that a freshwater inland sea formed by melting glaciers was released in a massive flood. While its conceivable that such a sea could form in Greenland as the glaciers there melt it would take a long time so even if we get a similar thing happen from current warming it wont occur any time soon.
