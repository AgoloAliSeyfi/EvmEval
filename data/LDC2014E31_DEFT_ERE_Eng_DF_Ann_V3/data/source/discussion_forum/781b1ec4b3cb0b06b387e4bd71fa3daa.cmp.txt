OH came home from work on Monday evening by taxi and found 3 men trying to break into the house. They set upon him, knocked him to the floor and kicked him several times in head and stomach, stole his mobile phone and bag and ran off. The police came out very quickly, did a drive around with OH and the cabby but didn't see them that night. They took DH's bag (which they found dumped a few streets away) and said they would forensically test it, and there was a CCTV camera which covered the area and the cabby said he could definitely identify the men as he got a clear view.

DH has not been asked to give a statement, and we assume nor has the cabby. He got a letter in the post this morning, dated Tuesday, saying the police were closing their investigation. The detective in charge hasn't answered phone calls and his bag hasn't been returned to him, which contained business papers and clothes. DH did need treatment at A and E after the attack

It seems pretty clear that the police did not bother with forensic testing and may not even have checked the CCTV footage <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/angry-smiley-030.gif"/>. Is there anything which can be done to challenge their decision not even to do a preliminary investigation into an attempted burglary and common assault, where there are witnesses to the attack? If it is relevant at all, DH has no previous convictions, arrests or anything similar with the police, and is a middle aged businessman set upon by 20 year old males of a different racial background to us.

no, something is wrong here. They can't just 'close an investigation' the day afterwards, not having even taken statements. I'd say get some legal advice, or write to the Police, stating what you've put in your post above and ask for an explanation.

you could try posting this on the moneysaving in marriage and relationships board? you might get more answers there.

I would get down to the police station sooner than just writing a letter. If CCTV needs to be examined and has not yet been looked at, you want it seized asap, before it is recorded over.

It is of course possible that the CCTV wasn't working on the day in question but I am still surprised no other forensic examinations have taken place.

If a full note of your OH's / the cabby's evidence was taken in a police notebook then the need for an immediate witness statement is reduced.

Make a formal complaint.

The police are trying to fiddle the figures. Was it even recorded as a crime? Ask for the crime number and see.
