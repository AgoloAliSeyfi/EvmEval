Jerry Sandusky, former defensive coordinator of Penn State's football team, has been indicted on multiple charges involving sexual contact with a minor (you can find the indictment <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.gov/uploadedFiles/Press/Sandusky-Grand-Jury-Presentment.pdf">here</a>, but be warned it is a VERY difficult read). Over the course of over ten years, he used his charity for underprivileged children to meet potential new victims and established a pattern of abuse which has now been brought to light.

There is much to be discussed here, especially regarding the responsibilities of witnessing parties/athletic administration and the way the public will view the tragedy in the scope of "well, it's awful, but how will it affect FOOTBALL?"

This is beyond disgusting, many people should be in prison over this.

Matt Millen broke down talking about it on ESPN.

I'm not a legal expert, but I think failure to report is something that you can only get fined for, kind of a public shaming. But I agree, there should at least be a house-cleaning in the athletic department. One thing that is interesting is the contradiction between what Joe Paterno has said in his public statements recently (namely, that the GA gave him explicit details matching the testimony of what he witnessed) and in his own testimony (namely, that the GA had told him "something of a sexual nature" had been witnessed). Either he was really being vague on purpose in his testimony, he's lying now, or he was lying on the stand.

All of this is just awful.
