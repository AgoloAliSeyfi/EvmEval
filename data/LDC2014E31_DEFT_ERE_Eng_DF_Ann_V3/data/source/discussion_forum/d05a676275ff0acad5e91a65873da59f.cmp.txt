My sister and I used to cause sooo much s**t for our parents (she's my half sister, so we had our respective mothers, and our stepfathers because our father is a deadbeat cheater). One of the things that we LOVED to do was go on all-day hikes in the forest, get ourselves lost, and try to find our ways home before it got dark lol. Ohh did we ever have a hard time doing THAT sometimes lol. We once got home JUST as it got too dark to see without a flashlight.

We used to swim in the big pond every summer, and catch frogs and raise tadpoles... I also used to catch daddy longlegged spiders and torture my brother with them because he was afraid of them lol.

Although, my favorite memory is reading my big pile of books under my grandma's big ash tree with my old dog Snowball curled up at my side <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/> Unfortunately, said ash tree is dying, and Snowball has long since passed. My grams still remembers it tho, which is great.. because its one of the few memories she still has.

I was raised with my male cousin by grandma. We used to take our baths together and I guess grandma never concidered that we would eventually see the difference between both of us.

I didn't quite understand why my cousin wasn't like me and he didn't understand it either. So we wanted to be alike. We decided that I would get my scissors and cut off his extra meat ( I think we played doctor too much).

Good thing I had children plastic scissors. I still hurt the poor guy. Granted we never took baths together.

Also, i used to do like my grandma and wash everybody's clothes. I would put it in the toilet bol, add some hand soap and play with it. When i was done I would either flush or drag them around the house.

When I was about 5, my dad was 'babysitting' my cousin (6) and I. He was drunk and passed out as soon as our moms left.

We decided (for some reason <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/> ) to hide his boots and 'paint' his feet with anything we could find in the fridge. We unlaced his boots, took off his socks, and began our masterpiece. Mayo, mustard, relish, ketchup, peanut butter, jelly...and about ant thing you may find in the fridge. He was so passed out that he didn't even flinch.

Our moms came home and had no clue what to say. They tried to be mad, but laughed pretty damn hard. They made us clean it up <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/eek.gif"/>... he stayed asleep through that too <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/>

I LOVED spending summer holidays at my great-grandma's house. She lived in a tiny village (maybe 100-150 inhabitants) in the middle of woods and fields... they didn't even have a train station... you had to go to a neighboring village to catch a train... It was AWESOME. The nature was so amazing... I still remember the smell of freshly cut grass in the summer mornings... Waving at trains from a bridge and getting honked at by them in response... Ah, so many amazing memories... My great-grandma has long since passed... the last time I saw her I was 12 years old. I have yet to visit her grave. I will do so with my daughter this year...

I also adored to listen to my grandpa's WWII stories. He was taught how to play violin by a Nazi officer who cared more about music than about the war. He also ran into guerrilla fighters that fought Nazis and hid in the surrounding woods and got bitten by their German shepherd dog... I was always fascinated by history and people's past experiences... and my grandpa was such a good story teller.

I used to love climbing trees... and reading books while sitting on the branches <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>
