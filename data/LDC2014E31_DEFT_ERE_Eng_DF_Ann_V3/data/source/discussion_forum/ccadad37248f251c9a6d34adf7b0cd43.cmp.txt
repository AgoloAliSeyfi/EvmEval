Random men approaching you in the street asking you personal questions and stalking you?

Sometimes I could be walking in the street, minding my own ****ing business when a random bloke, usually foreign and black will ask me questions such as " Hello, whats your name? Where do you live? Do you have a boyfriend?" and sometimes just "Hi, how are you?" as if we know each other or something. Yesterday I was walking in the rain with my umbrella, wearing modest clothing (jeans, baseball jacket, Converses) when some random guy just starts talking to me like we know each other. <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/> The day before some chavvy looking bloke comes out of a store as I was walking past and nods his head at me like we know each other, and as I walked he kept turning around and then stopping in the middle of the street at some point. But the worst experience I've ever encountered was when I was 11, on my way to school one day when some guy asks me where a tube station is. So I say I dont know because I dont and walk away and he keeps following me and asks again. I say I dont know and then he proceeds to ask me personal questions. He asks me if I'm off to school and I say yes, then he asks me where I live, what my name is, etc. I tell him I dont speak to strangers but then I tell him I'm 11 in the hope that he'd back off but he didnt. He countined to follow me as I walked to the bus stop then said that he'd just like to know where x station is and that I "dont need to be afraid". I tell him that I told him repeatedly that I dont know where the bloody station is and he just kept following me. What made things worse was that it was difficult to get help from anyone in the street because they thought that he knew me. <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/>

I know some girls have experienced worser situations before, so I'd like to hear your experiences with this type of behaviour.

So, just because some creep in a car scared you when you were 11, you're using him to tar all men with the same brush, even someone 'nodding' at you. Get a little self-confidence and stop being terrified of casual conversation. All of those questions, with the exception of "Do you have a boyfriend", could be interpreted as just being friendly. Not everyone walks around in complete silence all the time, you know.

And just because someone 'nods' at you or asks your name does not mean they are hitting on you.

You get this a lot in downtown Nicosia, Cyprus -.- It's mainly immigrants or sleazy old Cypriot men, they start walking next to you and ask you questions.. I had a 65+ year old man ask me to come with him for a drink. I've had several people smile creepily and say in broken English, "Hullo, what is your name". Scariest was when I was sitting at a juice bar reading, minding my own business waiting for my ride home when this creepy old man with 2 teeth came up to me and said hi, he stood right in my face for a full 10 seconds before he walked off. I seriously thought he was going to hang around for ages and harass me, there weren't too many people around either.

It has happened to me a few times. I often receive stares from men and this is coming from someone who dresses conservatively. I suppose I am quite tall and apparently quite 'good looking'. Just to clarify, those aren't my own words. Sometimes they say 'hello' etc, but I try my best to ignore them.

In all fairness, why were you making your own way to school at 11? That's rather young isn't it? My mum still drops me off to school at 17.

Once when I was cycling a foreign man stopped me and asked for my bike as he need it to get to the airport. I was very frightened and made my way home quickly and he was crying <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/>.

Really? I was making my own way from age 9, public transport from 11, I thought a lot of people did.

Anyways - this has happened to me as well. Some guy on a train started asking me/my friend our names, school, addresses etc...But apart from that, no hassle thankfully.
