Exactly, no point either side denying the atrocities committed by it, that kind of thing only leaves lingering bitterness and paranoia.

During a 2 day conference in mid-2005, held by the US DOD, the Bangladeshis themselves said that the official number of civilians killed was around about 300,000 which had been misquoted in the past as 3 million.

As for the anti-Sikh riots estimates range from a highly unlikely 2700 to around 20,000 (that's what my wikipedia page says as well by the way). The Ahuja commission set up by the Indians themselves quoted the number of Sikhs killed in Delhi alone as 2733.

x "Bangladeshis themselves said that the official number of civilians killed was around about 300,000" -yeh right as if anyone takes pakistanis word

re operation searchlight -pakistan armies mission to exterminate student protesters in bangladesh with specific priority to non muslim groups yes of course, allow me to quote-
"as many as 3,000,000 as claimed by Bangladesh (from 1972 to 1975 the first post-war prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, mentioned on several occasions that at least three million died "

After much of the pakistani media claimed there to be a mistake in the numbers, later some bangladeshi ambassador staff stated there may have been some "mistranslation" though this has never been quantified.

but various other historians have later confirmed the murdering of bengalis by pakistani soldiers amounted to mass genocide - on a scale far larger than the region had seen before

"Ultimately approximately 10 million people would leave East Pakistan, and about 6.7 million were housed in 825 refugee camps"

October 1997 <a href="http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/wiki/R._J._Rummel">R. J. Rummel</a> published a book, which is available on the web, titled Statistics of Democide: Genocide and Mass Murder Since 1900. In Chapter 8, Statistics Of Pakistan's Democide - Estimates, Calculations, And Sources, he states:

And i didnt even mention the murdering of Balouchis and Waziris by pakstan that is still going on today.

Not really, seeing as you have already admitted you are completly clueless on this region (and yet are obsessed on passing comment on it)

and the fact that extremist islam and and the western far right have had many things in common in the past, hatred of jews for example.

Again britain takes some responsibility for the actions of pakistan seeing as they created it.

OH shove off, you're not impressing anyone. Troll.

Yes, we gave the Muslims a nation because they and the Hindus could not get along. It's not our fault the Indians chose to be Socialist and the Pakistanis have chosen to descend deeper into dogmatic madness.

Yes, the conference held by the US DOD and attended by representatives from Bangladesh and Pakistan where the Bangladeshis put the amount of dead at 300,000 was clearly some kind of elaborate ISI conspiracy. The Pakistani figure is near 30,000 by the way not 300,000. The situation in Balochistan and Waziristan is regrettable and I genuinely feel the pain of those living in these areas but it's wrought with complications- not something I expect someone only intent on slandering my country to understand.
