Shirley Sherrod, we now know that her video was edited, yet it was played on Fox again and again. And when poor Shirley was forced to resign, Fox comes out with a report, just tonight, that Obama threw an "innocent" woman under the bus. Now, Fox says she's innocent. Only now.

Except, you have zero evidence that Fox even played the clip until after the Administration forced her to resign over it. In fact, watching Fox will tell you the exact opposite of what you are claiming.

Of course, you will continue to pretend Fox has been attacking her all along. But the fact is, you idiots fired her before anyone knew about the story.

Not to mention... on the local news today, they had a caller trying to defend this racist bitch saying "she was taken out of context"... the problem is that she sure reveled in riling up the crowd with her story of 'sticking it to this white farmer'... and the crowd would not be knowing that she would be adding more at the end, was SURE APPLAUDING her story of what she did... showing even more the racist bullshit of the NAACP

But we will have the leftists defending racism once again, as long as it is within their ranks

I take it you did not hear the racist motherfuckers applauding during her story, all the while not knowing what she had to say at the end

Only six percent of posters will read that entire article.

except he's not wrong about the rightwingnuts setting her up...

yet another reason obama needs to stop giving in to them. it just encourages the loons.

it also proves that i'm dead on about breitbart being a lying hack...
