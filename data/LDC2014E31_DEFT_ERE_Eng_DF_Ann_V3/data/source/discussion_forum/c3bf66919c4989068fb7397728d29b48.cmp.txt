So, then why was she not found guilty of those things (in the 2nd sentence)?! Only the lying! Still, I find this incomprehensible...and I hope to God the jurors are receiving all the publicity/noteriety etc they so richly deserve. Needless to say, I agree with LaP on this...there isn't enough time (nor space) to say all the actual technical things about this case that are wrong to the bone.

Also, in order to find someone guilty of a crime doesn't it have to be within a "reasonable doubt"...not NO doubt, not beyond the shadow of a doubt; but "within a reasonable doubt" mother murdered her daughter?

im pretty sure all those other charges were dropped earlier because the prosecution wanted to go exclusively for the murder one

the jury can only decide on the charges that are put on the table

Look-let's face it. If Casey Anthony hadn't been able to afford a high-class legal team that was able to bumfuzzle the jury under the media spotlight, she'd be sitting on death row right now. I'm not in favor of the death penalty, don't get me wrong. I'm saying that people (poor people with court appointed lawyers) in murder cases have been convicted with evidence that's a lot more circumstantial than this. It just shows that justice is basically for sale in America, especially if the media is watching.

And that's fucked up, it doesn't matter how poor you are, they should need proof to convict you, not just a gut feeling and the fact that you make funny faces at the wrong times.

Isn't this stupid case over yet? Just ignore it and it will go away, there's plenty of more important things to be concerned over and to protest about. It's a bad thing, sure, but things like this happen every hour of every day all over the world in the system we have now.

If we change the system then we won't have to worry about things like this anymore.

Things like what?

While this case has gotten waaaay too much publicity, the one thing I am thankful for is that it renewed my faith in the justice system.. If only a little.

Seriously, you think that things are broken.... and that if they where fixed, she WOULD have been convicted?

Likewise! I'm quite relieved, it's excellent that the jurors can make intelligent arguments and defend themselves against nancy grace, and make a fair decision without letting emotion get in the way. I expected her to be convicted, and am more hopeful for america's future than I was before this dog and pony show.

So, I heard an, uh, interesting fact on the news tonight. Casey Anthony waited 31 days before reporting her child missing...? What the fuck.

Has anyone heard her explanation for this? I'd be interested in hearing it.

^ Her explanation is that there was no missing child to report. The child was dead.

Right, but according to her she didn't know the child is dead.

You don't either assume your child is dead, then wait a month to report it, or figure your child has been missing for a month, and then report it.

She must have been asked in court why she waited 31 days to report her missing daughter, what could she have possibly responded with?

Her defense was that she knew her kid was dead all along but that the death was an accidental pool drowning.

Oh, she actually admitted to that. To be honest I didn't follow the thing very closely, however for the past three days every news channel has been covering it so I caught bits and pieces here and there.

So in the end was it basically like an OJ thing; "We know you did it but we can't prove it." ?

How could she admit to knowing her daughter was dead and not get in shit for it? Did she admit to hiding the body and whatnot?
