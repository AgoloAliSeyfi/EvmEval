Not that I'm aware of, no. As I've yet to actually encounter a real life wahabi. However, I've encountered a few online.

Wahhabism does not equal extremism. I've encountered many Wahhabis in real life and not a single one of them believes that terrorist attacks such as 9/11 and 7/7 are legitimate. Wahhabis are fundamentalist (i.e. "strict adherence to specific set of theological doctrines typically in reaction against the theology of Modernism").

Although the number of Christians is declining you don't have a point. There are still far more properly practicing Christian children in this country than Muslim. Now, of course, Islam demands a stricter adherence to a rigid structure than Christianity because it is a cult, but that proves my point. On a global scale there are 2 billion Christians and they haven't committed one biblically inspired terrorist attack. Muslims on the other hand have committed over 16,000 in the last 10 years.

Given that a rather large proportion of the Quaran and haddith are fighting and being called to arms, it seems it is you who is being selective in what you read and not them.

The crusades comes to mind - which undeniabley was inspired by several quotes from the Bible.
The Quran and hadith are actually very clear in fighting only when attacked which compared the Bible isn't clear at all and has undeniably poor ethics when it comes to war.Although thats probably why the Bible isnt taken literally and so fewer people do attend the Church as there is confusion under knowing what is taken literally and hence many denominations of christianity. Which further proves my point that although the extremist attacks are under the name of Islam they arent religiously justified by the people - if anything its an unjustified attack out of feeling to dominate over others who dont follow their mentality. Its similar to the way some families of animals decide to kill the others of the same species out of feeling dominance and being the 'last to stand'. Simple.

It is supposed to be a prophecy of Babylon but the ethics of war including the killing of women and children is part of the Old Testament. Ezekiel 9:5-6

Note: I am talking about extremists here, not your every day, moderate young Muslims

Why is it that Islamic extremists usually tend to be quite young in the UK? I mean, when you see the ones who protest with extremist placards - they usually don't seem to be any younger than 40, most of them look 18-30. The 7/7 bombers were also quite young, the Christmas day bomber, etc.

This confuses me, because one would think that the conservative older generation would be more prone to extremism and a middle-aged first-generation immigrant from Pakistan, instead of a young, third-generation immigrant born in multicultural London.

So why does it seem that younger Muslims are more prone to extremism?

Look at any group and it'll usually be the young people (18-25 range) in it who hold the most extreme views. The arrogance of youth and a lack of experience of the world, we're all prone to it. Then we see more of life, realise things are a lot more grey and a lot less black and white than we thought they were, and mellow out, for the most part.

As young people, I think we are more open to new ideas and experiences. I can't relate specifically to being a young Muslim, as I'm a young Christian, but I think any liberating or empowering bold new ideas and ways of life etc can be very attractive to us young people as we try to find a our feet in life and plan how we will make our lives meaningful. I think all young people consider the latter quite greatly and deeply. I imagine that extremist influence and propaganda, if it can be described as such, aims to satisfy this desire for meaning in young lives. It offers fulfillment of the role as God's servant, and is assuring I guess as it offers the idea that ultimate judgement belongs to God, and so also offers early shelter and refuge from the toils and judgement in this world.

As Terry Pratchett said,
"The problem with having an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming along and putting things in it."

I think this speaks true for the case of young minds being more susceptible to being manipulated into extremism.

Spot on. They might not know a lot about the religion, so they're more likely to believe what others tell them they are meant to do as followers of the religion.
