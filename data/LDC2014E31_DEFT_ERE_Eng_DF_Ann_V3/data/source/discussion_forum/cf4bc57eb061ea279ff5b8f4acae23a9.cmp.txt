Gah. When my grandparents passed away, I was co executor of their will. They lived in a 6500 sq ft house in the middle of nowhere and they rarely threw anything out. My step-grandmother was big into collectables, so naturally she had Beanie Babies. I just had no idea how many she had. In huge storage tubs. In every closet. I consolidated them and I had a 10x12 walk-in closet filled floor to ceiling with storage tubs. I quit counting at 1000 and that was about 8 tubs worth.

I regret not taking pictures while we got the house and contents ready for auction.

A large plastic tub of Beanie Babies was a serious source of contention for my parents during their divorce. I will always remember them as a symbol of their infinite ability to argue over everything in existence.

Pretty sure I found what you're talking about. Outfit's called NAEIR and they still exist, but membership is only open to schools/nonprofits and the catalog's only visible to members. <a href="http://www.naeir.org/index.cfm">Here's a link.</a>

This is totally it. I am googling around trying to find a copy of a catalog and all I found was this guys review.

<quote orig_author="Random Guy">
The Hedberg Public Library "belonged" to NAEIR for several years (you had to
pay about $600 annually for the privilege of reviewing the catalog.) The
office and computer supplies section was pretty random and seldom would
totally replace anything we were buying from a place like Quill. We used
things like jewelry, CD wallets, and holiday d√©cor as prizes at staff
meetings.

But the truth is we got so into NAEIR that we actually went to "the BIG
GRAB" one broiling August afternoon. We traveled to Galesburg, IL, on
Illinois's scantily marked byways in a mini-van, presenting ourselves at the
gate at our appointed time. We were number 150. Various other non-profit
agencies had armed themselves with pick-up trucks and rented stepvans, and
recruited some of their more brawny customers to help them grab.

By far the biggest item NAEIR had in stock was wrapping paper, greeting
cards and tschotchkes from the register of every failed card store in
America. Pallets and pallets: Happy Father's Day, Congratulations 2001 Grad,
Baby's First Christmas 2001, Snoopy in a Mortarboard, gift bags with
lazy-fishing-dad motifs. One of the rules of NAEIR is that the agency
getting the free stuff can't resell it - so what were "the Friends of
Russia" going to do with a 4' x 4' crate of Happy Father's Day wrapping
paper? Insulate their steppe homes, we thought.

We did manage to fill up a mini-van. We got some fabric that a staff
member's daughter made into pillows for the staff room. We got some 9 x 11
envelopes in a weird pink shade. We got tons of gift bags for our
Friendshop, though the manager was a little non-plused when we presented
them to her. We only narrowly avoided heat stroke and being run over by the
burly, toothless minions of "First Baptist Angel Hearts Day Care."

We did have enough gumption left over to visit Carl Sandburg's childhood
home, which is only 24 feet square and delightfully if anachronistically
air-conditioned. I've always been fond of Carl Sandburg. Galesburg...not so
much.

As a kid I remember we went into the warehouse and it was like building 19 but 10X the size and with less useful products.

The Big Lots near me has a ton of discontinued Monster energy drinks for a buck fifty.

I checked eBay and people are buying them for ~10 <img src="http://i.somethingawful.com/forumsystem/emoticons/emot-psyduck.gif"/>

I bought two cans of this at Big Lots last weekend. It tastes like drain cleaner mixed with malt liquor.

They had about 30 more cans....I'm debating going back to resell them now.

Okay, drat this thread for making want to explore around old shops for ancient treasure. Sadly I haven't found anything recently even remotely close to what I posted about earlier.

Any southeastern Ontario goons who can tell me where to go for old stuff, please speak up. If it's in Kingston so much the better, I can round up some friends who are into this kind of poo poo and we can make a day out of it or something.

As for the person who posted about old stuff in schools, I can attest to that. Last year I was filming a thing at my old elementary school, and low and behold - they're still using old edutainment games from when I went there back in the early nineties. That isn't the worst part - I think I remember the school having one of those "hang in there, baby" posters with weathered edges and yellowing paper hanging up somewhere. That thing was old when I was young, and they still might have it.

The cat the picture's based on is long dead by now. <img src="http://fi.somethingawful.com/images/smilies/frown.gif"/>

That poster is my favorite thing to change a co-worker's desktop picture to when they're having a bad day.

It even showed up in the Terminator TV series.
