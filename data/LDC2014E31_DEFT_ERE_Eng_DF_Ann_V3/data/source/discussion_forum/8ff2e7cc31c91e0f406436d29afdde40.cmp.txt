Am posting under a different user name as OH knows my usual one.

Since being made redundant I have worked really hard at both getting the house together and finding another job. OH has some health problems and have been supporting him through these as well. It's gradually dawned on me that OH is just not committed to our marriage, he has spent his days watching tv, dvd's and on the computer while I do housework, cooking cleaning etc.

To cut a long story short we had words today after hoovering downstairs he'd made a mess which he'd just left, presumably assuming I'd clear it up. We had a row and a while later he came down with a backpack and basically said if there's any more of this I'm off. After a few more words he walked out.

This has been a pattern of his during all the time we've been together, I think he expects me to run after him (which in the early days I did) to reassure him I love him (which I do, very much).

Am now sitting here wondering if this time he will actually come back, frightened, very unhappy and don't know what to do. Just had to put this down in writing, I don't have close friends as he didn't like me spending time with them, so cyber space is really my place for venting and discussing how I feel.

Sounds like my ex. Do what i did, wake up and smell the roses ! A relationship should be about give and take, you shouldn't be doing everything but, like me, you made a rod for your own back by running after him and now he can't cope with the fact that you've realised thats not how it's supposed to be. When (if) he comes back, you both need to have a long chat about how you feel, if he doesn't know you're pi**ed off or why, you need to spell it out to him. If he doesn't like what you say, you have a very big decision to make. My ex did me a favour by going off with his slapper of a girlfriend, i've never been happier !! You might struggle at first, but as someone once said "don't go looking for the light at the end of the tunnel, stomp up there and turn the !!!!!!! thing on for yourself" !!! You won't be Sadme for long !

If you run after him you are saying "your behaviour is ok"

Is it?

I think you really need a serious talk with him if/when he comes back tell him a few home truths and then you can truly move forward if you want to.
