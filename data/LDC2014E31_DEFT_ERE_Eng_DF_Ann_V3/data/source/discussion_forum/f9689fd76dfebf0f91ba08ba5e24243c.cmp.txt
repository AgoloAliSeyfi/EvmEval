Sorry to butt in- what are your opinions on this matter? Just interested <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

Hmm. I think that, both government and economy have an influences, just as much as they do on everything else. Thats inevitable. However, when going into detail. I believe education is EXTREMELY important. Little knowledge is dangerous. (hence why i set up this thread) a good and justified education is what society and a countries reputation is most likely to benefit from. Hmm, economically, im not entirely sure. Which is why i asked <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

Dont mind you butting in, ha ha.

I like this. Makes sense. However dont you think that regardless of where they get what they need, its their responsibility to conform to the culture and language of the host country. Surely thats common courtesy?

You and I think that- but unfortunately not everyone thinks the same!

I think there's 2 things in play here:

One is laziness- it's easy to not learn a new language and just stick with people from your background, and build your own shops and things so you don't have to mix with other ethnicities

The second is a sort of fear, obviously it's not easy to move to a different country, and so it is much easier to just move close to a huge community of your own, safety in numbers and all that! And then I think that they get used to living like that, and it turns into the laziness I described above.

Down the road from us there's an Indian couple in their 60s, who have been here for 40 years and can't speak English. My mum speaks Hindi so she goes and helps them do EVERYTHING. Like, phone the gas company, accompanies them to cash machines cos they don't know how to read properly so they can't use it, and other mundane things we see as daily routines. My mum has encouraged them both to go to English classes but they can't be bothered. They have gotten into the habit of asking others to do absolutely everything for them, and so don't want to make an effort lol.

Post academic sources? Via cut and paste? Have you no opinions of your own you can articulate?

There seems to be a lot of the 'I'm not racist, but....' brigade on here. If people want to discriminate then fine, at least behind the protection of anonymity on an internet forum they should have the courage to admit that this is their primary motivation. Justifying it with examples of discrimination against their own perceived in-group is just weak. I have experienced first-hand racism and discrimination. I refuse to use it as justification for anything, it's simply an evolutionary throwback.

I identify with my own ethnic community and I have a strong ethnic identity along with feeling a very strong kinship with members of my own community. If you feel discriminated against because of that I could not give a **** <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

Honestly? Id say the schools are sorting this issue out by itself - at least the mixed raced schools - not the ones that are 80-90% one ethnicity etc... In these types of schools, the schools should make links with say other schools that are mixed or nearly all White.

Social projects would work as well - I do slate Bradford, but I think Bradford does this quite well. They organise things like kids days out for free over the summer and it's nice to see people of different colour getting on and mixing from these events

Basically, social events and education, particularly focused around kids where they are not as prone to just listening what their parents say, but can see what is going on around them and what is real and what is not

Thank you so much for your post! Do you think we'll see a noticable change throughout the UK and have such an influence as Bradford has made?

Like this! <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/> But do you think that if there werent such dense communities throughout the nation, would people whO have migrated here, be more likely to make an effort to adapt?
