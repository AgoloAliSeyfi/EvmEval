Major is the only party leader in British history to lead his party to break the 14 million votes mark in a General Election.

Even the Blair landslides of 1997 and 2001 did not get as many votes as Major back then. Considering that election campaign was fought in the midst of a bad recession, against a fairly well organised Labour party, after the Tories had been in office nearly 13 years already, to get 14 million votes is an incredible achievement and reflects the high level of popularity Major had at that time.

Well. To be fair she didn't have any real competition now did she.

The opposition was of the same calibre of the current leaders of the main parties. Someone like her in this Era would destroy any of the idiots currently leading the parties.

She was capable, though. We need more politicians like her that's for sure.

Seems like people like to glorify the past too much. Most people here (including myself) were not old enough to experience a Thatcher administration. It's easy to read from a textbook about XY issue and say "yes, she was the best", but asking the people who lived and worked when she was in power may show differently. Obviously the poll shows Thatcher is most favoured but 20 years later, people might say how Tony Blair oe David Cameron was a great.
I would take this with a pinch of salt

i suspect history will be kinder to Major as it has been kind to Callaghan and Attlee and less kind to Brown as it has been less kind to Heath.

I mean that compared to the PM's that succeeded her there wasn't really much competition. In that her successors have been so dire that compared to them it really wouldn't be difficult to be considered as the most capable. (Hope this makes sense).

Actually that is somewhat a myth too, motorways were already being built in various parts of Germany even before Hitler came to power, it is just that he expanded and rapidly accelerated its construction.

The Public didn't trust a Conservative majority, hence why it was their 5th lowest total since 1922.

I understand that, that's obviously why they need the coalition! But I'd prefer the Conservatives to be more right-wing. Make of that as you will, we are entitled to our own opinions. I am aware that some people are very anti- Conservative. (Not sure why but there you go). Along with this, there is increasing apathy (which is very worring) among younger people and some of the lower social classes. Most voters are not very well-informed and will make very stupid decisions at the ballot paper (i.e. voting for Labour).

In essence, it is fair to say voters were not going to 'trust' the Conservatives, though Labour are much worse as they proved, but there are other factors such as low voter turnout.

Why do you think I am a 'troll'? You refuse to respond because you know that what I had said has some truth in it.

The Hitler argument comes up quite often "I know he was a bad guy but..."

I struggle to see what he actually got done effectively. He left the German economy in ruins and he failed on two fronts militarily and suffered a humiliating military defeat.

The officers did wear nice uniforms though... Its a shame that Feldgrau is now taboo because of the Nazis... I think it's a very nice colour for uniforms... dress uniforms especially.
