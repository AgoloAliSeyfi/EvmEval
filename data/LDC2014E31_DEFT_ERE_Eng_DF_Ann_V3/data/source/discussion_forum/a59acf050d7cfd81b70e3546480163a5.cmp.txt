A defiant Saddam Hussein has rejected charges of war crimes and genocide, telling a judge: "This is all theatre, the real criminal is Bush.''

Â“I am Saddam Hussein, the president of Iraq,'' Saddam twice said.

Saddam defended the invasion of Kuwait, saying it was "for the Iraqi people''.

The seven broad charges against Saddam are:

the killing of religious figures in 1974;
gassing of Kurds in Halabja in 1988;
killing the Kurdish Barzani clan in 1983;
killing members of political parties in the past 30 years;
the 1986-88 'Anfal' campaign of displacing Kurds;
the suppression of the 1991 uprisings by Kurds and Shiites;
the 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

Specific charges will be filed later, said Salem Chalabi, director of the Iraqi Special Tribunal. Those charges were expected to include war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.

He also chose to not recognize the new Iraqi government. I think we should have him tried by a Kurdish/Shitie court, they have plenty of reason to give him death.

I don't think we should put him to death. I say let's send him to Alcatraz, lock him up in maximum security, and let him rot for the rest of his life. Then he will be wishing we gave him the death penalty.
