If this was truly about medical health, then it would be about condoms and not the pill.

The women who need the pill for legitimate medical reasons are a tiny minority who would incur a very small cost to the healthcare system for their medication. To use these innocent women as human shields is vile, disgusting, shameless behavior.

The rest of the women who want the pill would multiply the cost by a factor of ten. And so these women need to justify the expenditure.

They have not.

For these women, the pill serves no preventative medical purpose whatsoever. In fact, a condom is far safer as it actually prevents the spread of disease. But they did not ask for condoms.

And that is why they cannot hide the fact this is about subsidizing their sex life, which is a totally bogus argument for a handout.

So that is the end of that.

For the pro-life camp, they don't get off so easy from me, either. For decades, pro-lifers have been bitching about Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood gets federal funds to hand out birth control. Most people, including pro-lifers, are NOT morally opposed to birth control. However, money is fungible and so when you give cash to PP for birth control, that frees up other monies which can be spent performing abortions.

While Congress is technically not funding abortions, it actually is.

For the life of me, I do not know why after all these years it has not occured to the pro-life movement to open their own women's clinics which can then be used to provide adoption services, pre-natal care, and birth control. And if Congress is going to be spending money on birth control regardless of whether or not you think they should, then these clinics should get that birth control money, too. And there will not be any stain on that money abetting abortions.

This is America, and we thrive on free enterprise and competition. Time to wake up and get smart, folks.

the GOP is fighting for freedom of religion.
the left is fighting for freedom of choice.

you have it backwards.

the GOP is fighting on the basis of religious institutions. where in the discussion has kaiser, united health care or blue cross / blue shield come up?

No sir. You have it wrong.

It started as freedom of religion when the Catholic Church complained.

Obama agreed and compromised.

However, the compromise meant that insurance companies can be told by government that they MUST offer something, even if it goes against their morals.

When has ANY business been told they MUST offer a service?

It is about freedom of choice.

The left wants the people to get BC form any insurance company they want to......at the cost of freedom of choiuce for the owners of the insurance companies.

The right wants the inmsurance companies to ALSO have freedom of choice....so sell it if you want...dont if you dont want to....take insurance with one that offers it or take insurance with one thayt doesnt.

Freedom of choice is swecured for both sides the GOP way....freedom of choice is eliminated for owners of insurance companies the left way.

no matter how much you keep telling yourself that, its not the essence of the debate.

show me where the health insurance companies are coming together to protest the contraception mandate.

they are not, it is the church and religious institutions involved in health care.

i didnt know they church sold insurance now? this is news to us all....

you do realize that there is a difference between an insurance company and a health care provider right?

Some institutions are self insured because they make enough profit to cover the liabilities.
