I don't know if anyone will read this, but I just feel desperate and feel the need to tell someone.

This September I left home, and started at University. I was incredibly anxious about doing this, but rather delayed thinking about it until I got here! Now I'm here, and have been for over two weeks, I feel terribly overwhelmed by it all and feel unintelligent and socially awkward.

I have been struggling emotionally for the majority of my life since moving to Secondary School, although I did lose my dad at around the age of 9 and always used to blame that for my feelings. I have had two periods of counselling in my life, over roughly 15 months from December 2009 until around March this year.

I feel at the moment like the problems in my life are incredibly overwhelming, and are making me ever more doubtful of my always low self-esteem. I have no ability to concentrate on work, often find myself becoming very quiet in social occasions, and doubt myself over anything and everything.

Neither of my counsellers have diagnosed me with depression, and both have suggested I do not suffer from it, but it is a huge worry to me, as depression was the cause of my dad's death, suicide.

I have tried to solve my problems before, and have found exercise and meditation particularly useful, and have also tried things like self-help books and tapes. But my general feeling, is, 'Is this what my life will be? My one chance at existance, my one chance of being a young man, I am wasting it!' And these feelings are beating away at me.

I simply don't know what to do, and when I think of things to do, I never follow through with it. Friends often say I'm lazy, and I can't disagree a lot of the time. I feel like everything anyone could do to help, people have tried, and time and time again I fail.

Sorry to anyone whose read this jumbled mess, and I feel a bit like a self-seeking moaner, but I truly do feel desperate.

Its not uncommon for people's existing feelings about themselves to become more intense when they are in new situations and feel the pressure to socialise with strangers and fit into new roles, i.e. being a university student.

I am not a health professional and I can only speak from personal experience which is why I strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional about your feelings and worries about depression.

Most people feel unintelligent and awkward when they first get to uni- you're definitely not alone there. But I would really recommend that you get an appointment with your uni counselling services. It doesn't really matter whether anyone has told you that you are depressed or not, you are obviously having some problems at the minute and could use some support- labels aren't as important as your experiences. Meditation and exercise are really helpful, so definitely try to do those. But yeah, you will have to engage with help and life in general to get somewhere- but don't beat yourself up about feeling unmotivated to do anything at the minute, lots of people feel like this and hopefully it will pass as you begin to feel better. Being unkind to yourself will only make you feel worse- be kind to yourself and get some help.

Good luck.

I think a lot more people feel the same way as you do, but medicate themselves by using friends. Whilst it probably isn't a 'solution' as such, being around friends whilst being depressed is definitely better than being alone and being depressed. Either way, if you fancy a chat, feel free to PM <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

If i were you id focus on an idol. Someone you aspire to (not want to be them but someone who your admire and have respect for) e.g. someone who came from a bad background and ended up successful and happy with a family and married etc etc

Focus on what you want to achieve in life, you havent stated what your studying, or indeed why....is it because you wanted the experience? Because your mum wanted yo to go? Because u need a degree for the career you want to do?

Either way, sum up why youre there and work your bottom off to get the best grades you can, cos once you get ur degree, you wil have something you can say "hey i didnt fail, it was hard work and i passed"

hope this helps <img src="images/smilies/colondollar.gif"/>
