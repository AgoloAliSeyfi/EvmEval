How do the children get welfare? How do children get health insurance? They get these things through their parents who, instead of being responsible, mooch off of the taxpayers. The democrats pimp the children as victims of 'heartless Republicans' when, in reality, the children are victims of their pathetic parents.

Just when I thought you could not be any more dense, you surprise me.

Oerdin often has a problem with connecting the dots. Nobody blames the children, and welfare should be in place for those families who really need it. I am not convinced that we are screening applicants enough to weed out the moochers. The story about the chicklet who won a million in the lottery and felt entitled to still collect food stamps because she didn't have a job is a perfect example.

There are stupid people and "moochers" on both sides of the political spectrum.
That's why birth control is so important. <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif"/>

It's also been reported she has been cut off. Will she have to pay back what she accepted after her lottery winning? She should.

I would guess at the time she applied she might have been well qualified, but a failure in the system is not keeping tabs on peoples incomes monthly.

I have nooooo clue how it works here, but in Canada recipients of AISH are required to fill out a card EVERY month to report ANY changes in living situations and any possible earnings. The problem there is, when a person CAN put in some hours to help their situation, they're punished by having that amount deducted from their check, or the threat of losing those checks altogether.

I read that she was required to inform the authorities about income changes WITHIN 10 days! She should, at least, pay back the money.

But you don't have a problem to pay, collectively, for birthing related charges of other people?

She didn't seem like the brightest bulb in the tool box, but yeah that should be paid back.

Did anyone hear on the news today about a woman who won a million dollars in the lottery, owns two houses, and she still collects food stamps?

What a friggin' deadbeat.
