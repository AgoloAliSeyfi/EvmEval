Oh wowza...Sheppard Smith talked about it for a WHOPPING ten minutes.

Big whoop! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/>

I'd still need to see a link to believe that tripe.

Maybe they just report the facts and don't waste time creating faux outrage without some legally sound facts to back it up?

Maybe they don't want to whip up hatred for the sake of ratings?

Maybe they don't like race baiting?

Wipe your chin, Marc, you're drooling again.

FOX is covering this, as are many, many media outlets.

You've gone beyond emotional basketcase and into full hysterics.

As I said, asswipe, he covered it for quite some time, I'd say for 45 minutes at a minimum. And the other news anchors covered it earlier in the day and you'll see it later too.

The truth is you don't believe it cuz you don't wanna believe it. And that's fine, your entitled to whatever you wanna think. But don't be pretending you want a serious conversation minus any bias, cuz you can't offer the same. Why don't you tune into Fox News dipshit, and see for yourself? Might I suggest the lead story at or near the top of every fucking hour until O'Reilly shows up?

I'm going to watch all the FOXNEWS shows tonight like a hawk.

From what I've seen thus far, they've been a day late and a dollar short. Tepid and very light coverage when they did cover it...spinning it more like it's an opportunity for the Left to grab their second amendment rights away from them.

The FOXNEWS questions and covers the authenticity of President Obama's Presidency, citizenship and religion 1000 times more than they cover the Trayvon Martin killing.

I'm not buying your hypocritical hyper-partisan BS.

You really need to learn to differentiate between 'news' and 'comment'. A substantial amount of FNC's programming is dedicated to comment programs. Currently, with this particular issue, there is nothing for commentators to really be discussing... other than to indulge in race baiting - like you are. Their news coverage has covered it... in sufficient detail as is available. The hysterical bullshit and speculation that you indulge in has no place in a 'news' program.

Now, try and use the limited intellect you possess to think logically and dispassionately - without regard to the victim's race about how much solid factually accurate information there is about this case... 10 minutes would seem generous to me.
