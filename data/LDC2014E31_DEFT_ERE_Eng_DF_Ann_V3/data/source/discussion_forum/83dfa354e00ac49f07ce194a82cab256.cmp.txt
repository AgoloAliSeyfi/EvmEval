This is an excellent essay, too.

Penn State Flagged for Illegal Procedure</a>

No, actually, it's not. It's a piss poor hack piece written by some nobody schmuck portraying the mob mentality so dominating these discussions and attitudes now, full of accusations and witch-burning attitudes and rather lacking on facts. Not that most care about such things right now.

You'll have to show evidence that Paterno thought someone else was handling it.

So much for innocent until proven guilty eh? But OK: it is a matter of record that he reported it to the AD, which is where the responsibility to handle it from there lies.

And then you'll have to show evidence that he had no vision, hearing or sensibility because he seems to have not noticed that the police didn't show up on campus.

<img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/mazeguyemotions/boggled.gif"/> No I won't, nor would he. Can you really not see how ridiculous that is? You seem to really literally think Paterno is "the" God. Apparently this will come as a shock, but Paterno cannot and does not know or see every single thing that happens on every square inch of that town, FYI.

He's a football coach, not law enforcement, judge and jury.

Hey you got something right.

It certainly seems like they're head hunting when Joe Paterno is fired and Mike McQueary whose inactions I find more reprehensible than Joe's hasn't been fired yet.

</quote>
Hey somebody gets it, thank you. Yep. McQueary wasn't nearly a big enough fish to fry. Paterno's axing was to satisfy the mob's desire for blood and hopefully take a lot of heat off of them by "doing something." So what if it's the wrong thing? Nobody cares. Just GET SOMEBODY. Brilliant.

While I understand where you're coming from, it's difficult to appreciate unless you've lived there how loved and revered JoePa is in that community and by those students. It sounds crazy that a feeling of "family" can be generated on a campus of 40,000, but that really is the case there, and JoePa is the patriarch of that family.

When a family member takes heat for something, your first instinct is to rally around that person. Picture how you might respond if your dad or your grandpa was embroiled in a controversy. You'd do what you could to support the person you love, at least initially.

EXACTLY. Thank you. I have put this to others and rarely get a response, let alone an honest one, ie: if (for ex) your father was accused of knowing about an act like this and did nothing and was getting ripped left and right, what would you do? Assume they are right and join in or defend your dad? What if it was "only" a beloved uncle or grandfather? I think we all know the answer.

Perhaps you didn't notice, but the JREF is not a court of law.

You didn't read the Grand Jury report, did you?

It makes me wonder if any of these rioting students bothered to read the Grand Jury transcript. It seems that very few of them did or if they did they refused to believe it. The university has a bad enough reputation already without students protesting and rioting to support a child rape enabler. It will take almost forever for this institution's reputation to recover, and that is based on what we already know. A lot more dirt is sure to come out with the Feds getting involved, the trustees conducting their own investigation and the upcoming trial of Sandusky. This train-wreck will only get worse.

As an aside, I never quite understood why so many people think of accomplished athletes or successful coaches as "heroes". The naive all too often equate success with goodness or high moral character. I can understand Paterno being admired for his success, but I cannot understand this "living legend" God-like status he has at the school. The students there act like he can walk on water or raise the dead, even after being exposed as a mere mortal of questionable character.

If I had a child who wanted to attend college, I'd recommend he or she stay away from any college that turned its students into lemming like cult-members over something as frivolous as football. I admit I have trouble understanding this pervasive quasi-religious football culture at so many American universities. Then again, I didn't go to college.

I would examine the evidence available and then make my mind up. If I thought a member of my family or circle of friends had responded as was described in the Grand Jury paper I would be more angry than I would on learning of a similar set of circumstances involving a work colleague.
