The Falklands the first Gulf War and to an extent the second gulf war.

I see what your saying but if we have a chance to help people fight for democracy and not be brutally crushed then we should do something.

There is no inherent good in democracy.

We rarely get the chance to support rebellions as in most cases the rebels are as bad as the government they are fighting. Libya can be seen as a popular uprising against a Tyrant.

One excepts tyrants in government. Life is tough, get over it.

But there is inherent good in basic freedom and liberty to choose your government. Gadaffi is bombing and murdering his people. He should be stopped

All key US allies.

If you saw someone in the street being mugged then beaten to a pulp, would you try to help or would you walk by on the other side of the road?

</quote>

Equally, if you then saw another person being mugged, having intervened the first time but deciding against it this time around, is that not kind of wrong?

Walking away from it is cowardly so I would help the muggers.

Firstly, Gaddafi was not an enemy of ours.

</quote>

Tell that to the victims of the Troubles, the people of Lockerbie and the family of PC Yvonne Fletcher.

<quote orig_author="rajandkwameali">
Secondly, Gaddafi is the autocrat of his country, if he wishes to stamp out rebellion, it's his prerogative. All states hold the right to defend their own interests. Humans are cruel, people should get over it, it's our nature.

</quote>

Yes, all states do have the right to defend their own interests. In this case, the UK is defending it's own interests, comercially and diplomatically at the UN. All I can say is sucks to be Gaddafi.

<quote orig_author="rajandkwameali">
Additionally, shouldn't our own armed forces be used for national defence only ? Of all of these conflicts over the past 20-30 years or so, which directly affected our interests:

- The Falklands
- The First Gulf War (liberation of Kuwait)
- Bosnia
- Sierra Leone
- Kosovo
- Second Gulf War (removal of Saddam)

I would say only The Falklands.

</quote>

According to the MOD, this is the Mission of the Armed Forces
Peacetime Security
Security of the Overseas Territories
Defence Diplomacy
Support to Wider British Interests
Peace Support and Humanitarian Operations
Regional Conflict Outside the NATO Area (intervention in self defence)
Regional Conflict Inside the NATO Area (intervention in self defence)
Strategic Attack on NATO

So
- The Falklands (Security of the Overseas Territories)

- The First Gulf War (Defence Diplomacy, Support to Wider British Interests, Regional Conflict Outside the NATO Area)

- Bosnia (Defence Diplomacy, Support to Wider British Interests, Peace Support and Humanitarian Operations)

- Sierra Leone (Support to Wider British Interests, Peace Support and Humanitarian Operations)

- Kosovo (Defence Diplomacy, Support to Wider British Interests, Peace Support and Humanitarian Operations)

- Second Gulf War (Defence Diplomacy, Support to Wider British Interests)

do you honestly believe that we should've stood by and watched as the people of benghazi, 700,000 innocent civilians, were murdered?

we only intervene when practical. syria is only just reaching tipping point now, and we may intervene soon if we have the resources and if it looks like turning into genocide.

Bahrain would be a complicated mess, as cruise missiles are fine out in the desert where the tanks are sitting ducks, not in civilian areas like the whole of Bahrain.

Saudi Arabia is better armed and would be a huge provocation against religious muslims, as it has so many islamic holy sites. also, it hasn't got to the point where there is a serious revolution under way that we could support without taking over the rebellion.
