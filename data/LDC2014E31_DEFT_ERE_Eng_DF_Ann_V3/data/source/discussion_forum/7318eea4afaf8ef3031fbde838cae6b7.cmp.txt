For middle and liberal support?

</quote>

But why would decieving them really get their support?

I dont understand these politicians. Whats the point of getting "Supporters" if you get them dishonestly? They turn on you the first second they realize you are lying

</quote>

This is why I can't stand Paul haters. They dislike one or maybe two things about Paul and it's allll over with for him... Then these same people run off and support self declared progressives (Newt and Mitt), then have a fit when it looks like Paul supporters might not vote for a morally and politically corrupted person like Newt, costing the Republicans their election.

</quote>

These are the same people who declare "we're not going to get a perfect candidate", yet say they'll stay home or vote for Boiking if Dr. Paul gets nominated.

You gotta laugh to keep from crying. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

I'm watching the debate now. So far this is what I see.

Mitt trying real hard to sound conservative.

Newt getting his butt handed to him.

Paul is the comic relief (no insult intended cause he is trying to be funny)

Santorum is wearing the big pants.

I just saw clips on the cnn website, it looked like Paul was schooling Newt on his saying the budget was balanced. He started to say that they weren't taking into account the money they took from Medicare and social security. The clip cut off though so I didn't see what was said after that.

Gingrich has some explaining to do about things he has said about Reagan.

Better to know these things now than to hear about them after the nomination is settled and Obama uses them to make Gingrich look bad.

p.s., your link didn't work for me, but I used your quote to find this one: <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/InsideCover/Limbaugh-Reagan-Gingrich-Romney/2012/01/26/id/425666">Mike Reagan, Rush Limbaugh Blast Romney</a>

It's easy to 'splain...Gingwad is a double-dealing necon opportunist, who'll say anything to grab power.

He's Clintoon with an (R) by his name.

I appreciate the accomplishments Newt had during his term as speaker. Most importantly welfare to work and bringing the Gop to power. Working across the isle to create a balanced budget with a surplus. I also like many of his current ideas.

I don't like his soaring liberal rhetoric as it relates to Mitt.

This is the 3rd time I've answered this question all be it with less detail this time. Please stop asking.

</quote>

Ok, thank you. As far as I know it was the first time I have asked you.

I still will say Newt might have been *part* of the reason we got a balanced budget but remember Newt is a very real *part* of the reason we got the housing crisis and the DoEducation, among other Government growth that has helped bankrupt this country.

As a Paul fan I see Newt's best 5 minutes of his political life as just another day in Paul's political career.

</quote>

The housing crisis was set in motion long before Newt came along. As far as the Dep of Edu, I don't know anything about it or its origins.

</quote>

Yes, but Newt played his part in the housing crisis, even made lots of money off it we all hear =D

I did a super quick google on the DoE.

Newt lies at every chance he gets to fool someone into supporting him.

It's inevitable. His presence in the race shines a floodlight on the ridiculous hypocrisy that is Republican SOP.

I'm watching the post debate coverage and can't believe my ears, AGAIN.

Newt railing on Romney AGAIN about his money. Bitching about Romneys investments. WTF?!

I want to support Newt but he keeps spouting liberal hate lines. The only one that doesn't is Paul and Santorum. Paul won't win and Santorum, even if he did, is so polarizing that I don't know if he could beat Obama.

Newt is so desperate to beat Romney that it seems he will stoop to any level, including the anti capitalism liberal lines.

Newt picked a bad time to fuck up.

One does have to wonder why an avowed anti-capitalist Marxist is so popular in the GOP.

One does wonder why Liberals like you would expect any of us to take what you say seriously when you Deny Obama is Liberal Let alone Marxist while Claiming Newt is a Marxist.

Your Stupidity rises to levels that merit ignoring. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

</quote>

lol....your rant is cute. You are all in a bunch since I claimed Obama is a moderate rather than a Marxist. Isn't that cute.

Me liberal? Perhaps in some ways, but I currently support the most conservative candidate running: Ron Paul. My next choice would be Gary Johnson. However, up is down and black is white in your twisted little world <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>
