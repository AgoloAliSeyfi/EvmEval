So I offered to host Thankgiving this year at our home for my husbands family. His mother wouldn't allow it, she wanted to have it at her house, which was fine. So I offered to make whatever she didn't want to, and at first she didn't want me to have to make anything. After asking about 5 times on what I could bring she finally told me pumpkin pie because she was making everything else. So the night before thanksgiving she asked me if I was still making the pie and I told her yes, I was going to make it from scratch with suger pumpkins I grew in my garden. She actually asked me if I had a can of pumpkin for back up. Grrrrr! I told her yeah and if the homemade pie didn't turn out I was making one out of a can as well so there would be plenty of good pie either way. All the while I was bummed I didn't get to make anything else. So I slave over this pie, it took 3 pumpkins to make and I make homemade crust, only to show up on thanksgiving to find that she had already bought a pumpkin pie. Omg I wanted to come unglued. And on top of all that she asked my sister in law to make everything, literally my MIL put a ham in a roaster and my SIL made EVERYTHING else. I was allowed to make a pumkin pie and she bought one just incase I sucked at that....... what a bitch!

P.S. my pie turned out awesome and got completely eaten, so she can suck it!

That was kind of rude.

Do you think she just told you not to bother because you just had a baby not to long ago? I don't know why that would matter, but it just seems odd that she wouldn't let you help out...especially seeing you offered.

Strange <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/confused.gif"/> Are you close with your SIL...maybe say something to her like, "oh I offered to bring more - feel kinda bad you had to make everything else"

Is your MIL normally weird - or is this out of character for her?

Glad your pie rocked though!! <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

I don't think its because I just had the baby because my SIL has a 6month old and a 2 year old. I don't really know what is up but I'm super mad about it. I don't know why I'm even upset really, she just saved me from more work, but the more I think about it the madder I am.

I would be mad too! That is pretty rude behavior. I would say maybe she is just a control freak, but then why would she have your SIL do all of it? I don't know. Sorry it bummed you out on Thanksgiving. :/
