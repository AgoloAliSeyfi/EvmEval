Yet another thread on this topic, first lets get this straight the Presidents budget did not cut any MONEY, it CUT and re-tasked program(s) within NASA and the DoD. In fact the President raised the funding, so why then would Republicans be for any of that based on a fiscal level when it adds to the deficit and accomplishes NOTHING. Starting with the F-22 and ending it's production at 187 in favor of the F-35 which by the way is an average aircraft at best in terms of performance and the US Navy is calling into question operating costs on that aircraft and due to these factors Sec. Gates yesterday fired the program manager for the F-35 project and is holding back 614 million in funding until these issues are addressed. One of those issues is the F-35's failure to perform well against current Russian, American, and EU 4th generation fighters. The Cut in the Constellation program will result in the US after the shuttles last flight this year, having to rely on Russia to provide lifting and resupply needs to the ISS which is a several billion dollar US investment. Further the US will be unable for the forseeable future to service the HST ( Hubble Space Telescope) as well as communications, GPS, and it's own sat. networks without assistance. We will have launch only capability with the Delta series rockets but no manned capability. That is is a FACT. Now if those of you who think that "outsourcing" our space flight needs to other nations at the expense of American security, jobs, and science is a good thing, then by all means continue to celebrate mediocrity.

Go to NasaWatch home page. Seems there isn't a whole lot of disagreement with this decision after all. And this was of particular interest. (I thought conservatives WANTED private enterprise to do all the heavy lifting?)

He is cutting spending. Isn't that what you want?
Sheesh, some will bitch if you hang them with a new rope.

You are one dumb fuck, the Space Program was so small it did not even register at 1 percent of the Budget. You do understand what happens when we can no longer reach space to repair satellites? Well then maybe I am giving you to much credit for intelligence.

Which "satellites" are you talking about? There are a slew of them up there that belong to private industry. It's their problem. The only "cut" was to the expensive and iffy "Constellation" moon project.

Working with NASA, the industry can develop the capabilities to safely launch U.S. astronauts just as commercial spaceflight providers are already trusted by the U.S. government right now to launch multi-billion dollar military satellites, upon which the security of our nation and lives of our troops overseas depend, wrote Bretton Alexander, president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, in a prepared statement. Investing $6 billion will fund a full program of multiple winners for commercial crew, so that robust competition in the marketplace can reduce costs and generate innovation.

6 Billion to develop a private manned space flight industry, Maggie, your smarter than that. Come now so far the ONLY private enterprise to even put a man in space was Burt Rutans group and that with spaceship one which flew to 328,000 feet and then back. It has ZERO lifting capacity to orbit and with the follow-on which has not flown yet it will be sometime before a private entity can even orbit a man around the earth much less develop the capabilites for complex procedures such as docking manuvers needed for the ISS and other systems. Space-X the other competetor that NASA has pinned all its hopes on has ZERO manned launch experience and so far is in its infancy in the launch of commercial LEO rocktes. (Falcon-9). In terms of 2008 dollars a program like Apollo would cost 145 Billion dollars, so it's nonsense to think that these companies will suddenly with this small amount of money will step in and take up the slack. In reality and NASA has said as such in the near term RUSSIA will provide launch capability and heavy lift capability when the shuttle retires at the end of this year. As for Ares.

Can anyone explain to me how the Russians have "caught up" ?

- We have the most powerful Air Force (and Naval Air) on earth
- We have the most advanced avionics
- We have the best missiles
- We have the best intelligence
- We have air superiority in any theater on earth

The Russians tried for 50 years to keep up with us and they couldn't. What makes you think they are our equal now or anytime in the forseeable future?

They just finished testing a stealth aircraft comparable to our F22 Rapter so now we're on the same playing field with them. They now have the only space program capable of delivering heavy payloads into space.

By the way....Chinese pilots can clean our clocks in dogfights so I wouldn't pound my chest too much if I were you.

Oh dear, I wonder when the plan of attack is scheduled for? Before or after the Chinese decide that without the U.S. buying up half their economy is more important than attempting a "dogfight" with us (a battle they might win, but would lose the war)? The Chinese will never relax its military might, just as Russia won't, not because they see any territorial threat from the U.S., but the threat comes from neighboring countries.
