According to MSNBC, this morning on Meet the Press Gen Colin Powell will endorse Barack Obama for President of the United States!

That is incredible and will certainly silence (no pun) a lot of the "he's too risky" bullshit coming from McCain &amp; Co.

I was hoping for this since Colin Powell is probably the ONLY Republican I'd ever vote for!

Another huge endorsement for Obama.

Powell should be led before a firing squad and shot to death for his role in getting tens of thousands of US soldiers killed, maimed, and critically wounded with false "evidence" he KNEW was false.

SO, the Powell fraud endorses the Obama fraud.. big deal.. America still loses

</quote>

Uh, tens of thousands of US soldiers have been killed in Iraq?

This is news to me.

Wounded and maimed perhaps but killed? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

it's just my opinion Black... you don't have to agree with it.

Powell had shown himself, prior to the Iraq war, to be a man of deep integrity. He resigned from the Bush Administration when it was revealed that the intelligence was faulty. I believe he did that because he felt they had used him.

I'm not privy to inside information so I am not stating this as fact, just speculation based on years of following this man and his actions.

I agree with you.

Let's point out the CIA Director, George Tenet, was a Clinton appointee and said the WMD intelligence was a "slam dunk".

So how come Powell gets a pass for being duped by Tenet but Bush does not? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

Its the Nuremburg Principle.

Powell wasn't an architect of this war, there's no evidence that he was involved in cooking up bogus intelligence, and behind the scenes all evidence points to the fact that Powell was trying to talk bush out of invading.

Yes, he's guilty of complicity and weakness. He's an asshole on a whole front of issues.

But the people that should be rotting in prison in the Hague are the architects, Cheney, Bush, Wolfowitz, Hadley, and the NeoCons who proactively engaged in deception and lies.

Silence is a Liberal by the way.

Powell didn't invent the war, but he knew it was based on lies and deceptions.. AND, he was silent.. and he's not a liberal.. which kinda' blows your theory.

Liberals are however, weak as mud.

Are you impaired in some way? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/> I agreed with the poster regarding Powell's integrity, etc. I simply pointed out that Powell is given a pass on accepting faulty intelligence from Clinton appointee Tenet but Bush is not.

Do you notice the amount of hypocrisy in that post?

If he endorsed John McCain, you'd be talking about how great Colin Powell is and what a great decision he made.

Don't bet on that based on what you see from some of our "elected" officials. You might be suprised.
