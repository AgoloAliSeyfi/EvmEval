The surrender offered by Japan prior to the bombs is the same surrender we accepted after the bombs.

This is what I mean. Either this is an accepted, established historical fact or it isn't. We shouldn't be debating WHAT happened. I thought we KNEW what happened. I'm very confused by these different scenarios you guys present.

If we A-Bombed Japan needlessly, it was not ethical. Or was it? Do we agree on that much?

I say no. Even though we benefitted from the object lesson/demonstration of US military power, the use of the A-Bomb -- TWICE -- just to flex our post-war muscles was not ethical, if it was not ALSO necessary to force Japan to surrender.

Pure horseshit. At first the line by Truman was "It saved lives." As it was getting revealed the bombs were not necessary it was "They saved 100,000 lives." As more facts were revealed it became "They saved over 200,000 lives." When Truman's book came out it was "They saved 500,000 lives."

Anyone see a pattern here? Now that we have a lot more facts the number gets increased to "They saved millions of American lives."

All the top military leaders including Fleet Admiral Leah, said the bombs were not necessary.

Furthermore, why didn't we drop the bombs where the highest concentration of Japanese troops were located? We purposefully targeted civilians which made our use of the A-Bombs terrorism defined. You don't target areas that are predominantly civilian. Yeah yeah...I've heard it before the cities were military targets because japanese military socks were made in the cities....or something as fucking silly.

You are arguing the wrong point. There was no surrender on the table before the A Bombs were dropped. The ONLY thing the Japanese offered was a cease of hostilities and the return of captured territory. They would hand over what ever they still had from after Dec 7 and we would hand over what ever of theirs we had from before Dec 7.

It is a bald faced LIE that the same surrender existed before as after and that we ignored it to bomb them.

My link is to SOURCE documents. We have the actual conversations from the Japanese Government.

Call me selfish, but if it saved even just one American life, I'd have dropped the A-Bomb myself. I am not asking for a pie-in-the-sky ethical debate.

I merely want to know, was it necessary or not? Had Japan surrendered BEFORE we bombed there?

RetiredGySgt says he can prove they did NOT, that he has source documents to back up his position. Well, is there any doubt that he does? Is there some question about these documents?

This is why there should have been a court proceeding. I am just mystified as to why none was ever conducted.

He is LYING. I have provided you with SOURCE documents. The actual conversations that occurred in the Japanese Governments meetings about Surrender, and after the A bombs.

The ONLY thing the Japanese offered before the A Bombs was a cease fire to move their troops from captured territory while we removed our troops from captured territory.

We demanded an unconditional Surrender just as we did in Germany. The Only concession we final relinquished on was allowing the Emperor to remain the Emperor.

Go ahead, I have provided the actual conversations of the Japanese Government, he has offered nothing. Ask him for evidence.

You just admitted we accepted a conditional surrender from Japan. If we were willing to accept a conditional surrender, the same one offered prior to the bombs, then why didn't we? Here are some links for you to ignore:
