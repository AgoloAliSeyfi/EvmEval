I remember when I was a kid, I loved to go to 4th of July parades. And sometimes I would see some men suddenly burst into tears as the flag would pass by. My parents explained to me they were veterans. WWII and Korea were not that far in the past when I was a kid.

I did not understand why these men were so emotional about the flag. A lot of people were actually burning the flag back then, and calling it "just a piece of cloth".

When I joined the military many years later, I did not do it out of patriotism. It just looked like a great way to get a technical education and to see the world. It certainly was not my plan to serve 20 years, but that's what I ended up doing.

Then one day after I retired, I went to a parade.

And the flag went by.

And then I was one of those guys.

Caught me TOTALLY by surprise.

The military is voluntary. Nobody is forced to join. You know you are going to "get shot at" when you join. Same with police officers. Firefighters know they are going to run into burning buildings.
But, how much subsidies are "enough"? If someone goes into the military for 3 years are we then supposed to keep that person for the rest of their life? Pay everything from healthcare to their car and mortgage? At what point does the military and perks become something beyond what it is intended and not just another govt dependency plan? None of us have issues with treating our military or soldiers well. We want the best possible equipment and gear and good pay. But, i see politicians using the Military in a way and trying to turn them into another govt dependency group.

Mortage? Car Payment? wtf are you going on about. The military doesnt pay for that. You get a pension and health care, only after serving 20 years or more. Less than that all you get is VA benefits.

</quote>

VA benefits. They ware what keep many bums in the streets alive. Then there are the criminals that use them to restart their lives. Oh yeah, front of the line for all those government jobs conservatives want to cut.

Conservatives love veteran's benefits because it helps people they've thrown out of work

Actually, shopping seems to go a lot faster now. I like the way they have it laid out - frozen stuff last. Remember a few weeks ago, before they had produce open and the new entrance - you started off with frozen stuff. I didn't like that arrangement at all.

Yep, it's much nicer now. Thank you taxpayers.

</quote>

You're not thanking Obama? Or does he only get blame?

</quote>

The last I read, Obama is also a taxpayer. He does not need a seperate thank you. He though, is the fucken idiot that submitted a dumbass budget that proposes that I pay a shitload more money annually for my health coverage. His budget last year got laughed at by the senate 97-0. I imagine that this year's will as well. The people need to know what the fool is up to. You, though, if employed and one of the few in this country that pays taxes, keep writing those checks and pay for the benefits coming to those of us that are due.

Using the conservative logic of the day -- as with Planned Parenthood, government payments subsidize other actions. Recipients are able to afford mortgage payments and car payments because the welfare subsidies ( VA benefits), handouts, free up other monies
