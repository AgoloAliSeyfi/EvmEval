The Peace Movement has not died, nor is it resting. I thought this would be a good time for a meeting thread to exchange information and to remenisce. Because so many peace activists also are civil rights proponents it seems natural to include both topics together.

It is difficult to determine if President Bush is so full of blood lust he will invade Iraq, whatever the cost, or if it's simply a game of chicken to insure that Iraq will disarm if it has not already done so. It is the place of the Peace Movement to act as though the former were true, until Bush's final decision has revealed itself. I confess, I do not understand the mentality that drives the current administration. I believe that the president has too much ego to allow himself to be a total puppet, though there is an element of that. I don't know how far down he is prepared to drag us; I don't know if the Democratic party has enough morale to rally itself against him.
My purpose here is not to rabble rouse, but to have a meeting with like or similar minds to discuss what has been and is going on.

Philip Berrigan has died at age 79 of cancer. He served eleven years total behind bars for his antiwar activities.

One of the voices of protest I fondly listened to belonged to Ed Sanders - Yeah, the gross poet wanna be who sang dirty songs as the leader of THE FUGS. Ed had a good ear for music and he had some great ideas in between the sex/drugs thing. He put the poets Matthew Arnold, William Blake and Charles Swinburne to music. (Well, with Swinburne it was more of a chant, almost a rap.) He did the same thing for Ginsburg's Howl he did for Swinburne.His own composition, RAMSES II IS DEAD, MY LOVE appears in Songs That Tell Stories, at the end of the thread. Another song by Sanders is JOHNNY PISSOFF MEETS THE RED ANGEL, from the album It Crawled into My Hand, Honest. The lyric in part goes
"I woke up all sweating
My derringer in hand
I have a hand grenade launcher
And a burp gun under the bed"
and
"Ain't no pink --- legislature
Gonna say I can't have guns"
He chastises Johnny, sayng at the end
"When the red angel comes
And the T. V. is cold
Will you pray in the dawn
For the rest of your soul
When you lie in the dour death coma
Do you think you're gonnago to heaven
Oh Johnny
With a violent heart
With a violent heart

(Are you ready, Johnny? Are you ready to meet me?)

Ahimsa oh Johnny ahimsa
In the spinning confusion ahimsa
In the flood of life death and torture
Ahimsa ahimsa ahimsa
Ahimsa is the seashell of Buddha
Ahimsa is the rose and the lamb

When the red angel comes
And the T. V. is cold...."
Sanders also wrote a book on the Manson murders. I think it may be called THE FAMILY.
Well, after all these years I searched his websit last week. What a dissappointment. He not only promotes Republican messages, he reads like an advertisement for the NRA. I left the site determined to still love the man he once was to me and so I continue to listen to his records to this day.

Last night PBS had a re-run of folk music of the 60s and 70s and I felt the old blood start to stir and I am ready to engage in political protest of this coming war. This time I am better prepared but feel it is an obligation to get active again.

I wish I were young and unattached for a couple of years so I could go where I need to go and do what I need to do, but, alas, I will mostly write and agonize. Still, that's something. In the 60s I went to the east coast because that is where the power center is located. I was extremely green and not at all effective for the most part. I did get my draft board excited when I mailed them my draft card. I think they let me slide because I already had my honorable discharge.
