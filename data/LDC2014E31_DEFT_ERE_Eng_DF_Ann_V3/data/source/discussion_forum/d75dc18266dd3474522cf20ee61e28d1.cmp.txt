Why do I get this sinking feeling that it's not so much denying the OP her "running away money" as more a case of making sure he keeps plenty for when it suits him to bail out of the marriage!

Are you sure that there isn't another woman somewhere about, waiting... ?

I hope very much that I'm wrong but so often in life I have discovered that when someone behaves out of character, there is a solid reason behind their actions although the spouse/partner didn't know it at the time.

I think re the £7.5K we might be being a bit harsh on the husband. I'm assuming that he had a stocks and shares ISA and she had either a cash ISA or just a regular savings account, and the reason for putting the money across into his name was probably to get a better long term return on the funds. Whilst the account is his name, he may well consider it joint long term savings. Certainly both DH and I have ISAs, but mine has considerably more in than his, because in the early days when we couldn't afford to save more than one allowance we just kept adding our savings to my open account rather than go to the bother of opening a second one. We only opened the one in DHs name when the amount we were putting into long term savings monthly was too much for one account. In a good, strong marriage, then the notional name on the account shouldn't matter.

With regard to paying off the mortage now, again, it might be that as stocks and shares are a long term investment, that it would be financially more sensible to make any overpayments with cash savings rather than investments.

I think the biggest issue here is the lack of trust that OP has towards her husband. Given the past affair, it is understandable, but surely it is not the sign of a healthy marriage. I wouldn't dream of having an emergency escape fund or feel the need to have *my own* savings, and I am suprised that anyone in a happy marriage would do so. I do think that all couples need to have access to an amount of readily available savings for emergencies, though, and £2K is not actually a lot of accessible money between them. So I would suggest it might be a good idea to build up the accessible cash savings before overpaying the mortgage.

Just a thought. Would it be worth sitting down with your husband and taking stock of your finances?

Look at your last mortgage statement and see just how much you need to pay it off. Look at your husband's ISA. If he's been topping it up every year, to take advantage of the tax benefits, then he'll be sitting on a tidy sum..... and you should know how much that sum is.

I say this because my mother leaves all the finances and savings to my dad. She hasn't a clue and I worry about that - even though I know that they have ISAs and savings certificates in their own names. Partners should take an interest, in my opinion - just so they know their situation in case of death or some other catastrophe.

If I were you I would take this opportunity to learn more about your joint financial situation. I certainly wouldn't part with my savings until I'd seen all the paperwork.

Good luck!
