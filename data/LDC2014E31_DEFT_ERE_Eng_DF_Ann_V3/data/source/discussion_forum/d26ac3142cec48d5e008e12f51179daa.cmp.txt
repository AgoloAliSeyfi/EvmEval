Wait - what? You gave a guy your phone number, and he came back with a full report of these activities? That is creepy as hëll. What was your reply when he told you this? I hope it was something like "uh.....you did what? That's weird, and not cool at all. Goodbye."
But also - how would a call your parents made be linked to your address? And what does "you seem to recycle them every six months" even mean?

My friend who works in the fire department said since my cell bill goes to my parents that might be the connection.
As for recycling my cars - I used to trade them in every two years.

Oh. That's not every 6 months. I wonder why 911 knows how often you get a new car based on your phone number. And since when does one call several years ago equal "a lot" of calls?
If you hadn't already gathered this, he's a creepy azzhole and you should run for the hills. I would be tempted to report him to 911 for this. And do dating websites kick people out for being creeps? If so I might consider letting them know too.

Because I have been in an accident with each of my cars. Apparently people like to hit me. Only one was my fault.
I am debating reporting him to the 911 center. He is working now and since he is a supervisor, may answer that direct line so I wiill call tomorrow when he is off shift. He deleted in online dating account.
It is creepy.
I just got another text. He is the supervisor for the entire county. Just lovely. Just freakin lovely.

I am guessing he could be fired for that. Some guy at the bank did something creepy like that to me many years ago. Sent me letters at home with information he got off my checks and included details about checks I had cashed. My brother happened to be in management at the corporate headquarters of the bank, so he gave him a call, and it stopped, but we could have hard him fired.

Regardless, he still has a supervisor.

Report him. That's so many bad things rolled up into one big ball of douche.
And maybe change your phone number? Yuck. I'm sorry

Whether it's illegal or not is a matter of your state and local law. 911 records are often public records that can be requested by anyone. This of course varies from place to place.
I'd be surprised if he hadn't violated office policy in doing that. Because of what we do, my clients have access to a lot of public databases. Even though the info (or at least the vast majority of it) is public, they're not supposed to be snooping around checking up on their neighbors.
He's creepy. Dump.his.ass.

Super creepy!

One of my friends used to do some online dating about a year ago (now she has a BF) and she got a Google phone number that she could give out rather than giving out her real cell phone. That way she could change it if there were any creepers. It's free to get a number and you can use it for phone calls or text; the phone calls forward to your regular phone number but the person calling doesn't know. Just a tip if you decide you still want to try even though this guy clearly wasn't a good one.
