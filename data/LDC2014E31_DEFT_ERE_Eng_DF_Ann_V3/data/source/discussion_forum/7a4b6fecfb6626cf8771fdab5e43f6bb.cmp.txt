@Setanta,

I was discussing Voter ID laws you insisted that voting machines were an issue. I do not see how voting machines are linked to hurdles in the ability of people to vote or how it is the responsibility of the Republicans to fix this issue.

Actually, there aren't many other countries where "voter fraud" is such a topic.

how many countries are stupid enough to turn over voter sign-up to political pressure groups which have a huge motive to ignore the voting laws while doing so?

I am referring to anyone other than the Sec Of State in each state who is allowed to sign up voters. I think that if you want to vote you should be made to go down to the Sec of State office and sign a form. If you are not motivated enough to do that then you should not be allowed to vote, as you are unlikely to be a quality voter.

Odd choice of adjective, Hawk. Would a quality voter be a person who was all gung ho for murdering a million or so Iraqis/Afghans, destroying countless homes and lives, spreading WMDs all over the place so little kids can have toys to play with?

Are Americans given a tube of K-Y Jelly after they vote?

"Here citizen, thanks for voting. Be sure to keep yourself well lubed for whoever get into power."

@joefromchicago,

Sorry, but this bugs me every time I see it repeated. ACORN workers were never charged with election fraud. They were charged with voter registration fraud. They were accused, in many instances, of registering ineligible or non-existent voters (largely because they were paid per signature, so the more bogus signatures they collected, the more they got paid). Registering Mickey Mouse to vote is a whole lot different from stuffing ballot boxes or rigging electronic voting machines.

It's not uncommon for specific types of electoral fraud (i.e. voter registration fraud and ballot stuffing) to be referred to under the broader umbrella of election fraud or voter fraud.

In any case, it's not as if millions of Americans might say something to the effect of:

"Oh, those ACORN people were only guilty of voter registration fraud? And here I've been thinking they were guilty of election fraud! Where's my checkbook, this organization got shafted!"

So voter registration fraud is a relatively benign scam, because the only guys getting cheated are the ones who paid for the bogus registrations.

I guess those guys were just looking to incentivize voter registration and they made the harmless mistake of assuming that's what they and ACORN had in common, a desire to see more citizens enabled to exercise their precious right to vote.

Come to think of it, why does anyone think that someone would pay for bogus registrations? It's not like they can be put to use in committing election fraud.

On the general topic, I think there are many voters today who shouldn't be voting at all. The last congressional election is pretty solid evidence for that.

I know, do you believe the Republicans didn't take back the Senate too? What kind of a moron votes for Harry Reid?

I am, therefore, all in favor of the government discouraging people from voting. But if the government takes any steps in this direction, it should focus on discouraging the growing segment of Stupid-Americans from casting ballots, rather than putting hurdles only in the path of the poor and lazy.

Fine with me, you pretty much catch all the poor and lazy by disqualifying for stupidity.

I'm afraid the circle goes much much wider than that, Finn.

I disagree with Joe that your vote should be taken away and I will defend to your death your right to vote.
