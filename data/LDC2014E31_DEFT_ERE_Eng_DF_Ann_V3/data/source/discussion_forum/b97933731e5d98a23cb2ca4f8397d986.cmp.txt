My solution is for these people to get the hell out of my city and organize in their own communities.

The city you live in also happens to be the financial capital of the world, a world that is in very severe financial crisis. Bad luck!

Now they are threatening to clog our court system by demanding a trial for every misdomeanor arrest. Perhaps at one of their "teach-ins and discussion groups" they can learn the actual meaning of civil disobedience -- accept the punishment to show that it is the law that is wrong, not the action.

Which civil disobedience rule book does that come from?

<quote>
These people are nothing but thugs...

Not true. They are non-violent. They have been violently attacked by the police and have not retaliated with violence. Count your blessings.

<quote>
... who think they can take over our city with mob justice and violence. Due to protestors two cops were hospitalized recently and a subway stop was shut down during yesterday's morning rush hour. Meanwhile I don't know anyone who would dare walk near Zuccotti Park at night, despite the police presence there. NYPD overtime is now over $3 million.

Who do you think is going to attack you?

So much for trying to help the other 99%. I can only hope we have an early and harsh winter.

I made some specific points, in response to your post, about banks having not paid back what was given to them. I notice that you haven't responded to these points at all. Instead you have posted a rant.

Getting back to the Occupy A Park That Isn't On Wall Street folks, I can across this <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/the99percentdeclaration/home">99% Declaration</a> ; not sure if it's official, but worth discussing.

Essential elements of the plan are as follows:

1. National convention to take place starting July 4, 2012 in Philly. Two delegates (one male, one female) to be elected from each congressional district. The delegates will come up with a Petition of Grievances, which they will submit to the Congress.

</quote>
It's an interesting concept in toto, but I'm afraid I can never support it since they require "delegates" to be of a certain gender. What were they thinking when they slipped that in there?

Yes indeed bad luck for the 99% of New Yorkers who aren't millionaire Wall Street bankers.

JPMorganChase paid back the TARP money. What don't you get about that?

They couldn't even get that right, Zuccotti Park isn't on Wall Street and there has been no occupation of the actual Wall Street, which by the way isn't where the headquarters of big banks the fools hate are located. Epic fail.

First Ammendment is fine. It's the idiotic crap that some corporate whore law clerk slipped into a decision as a headnote claiming 14th Ammendment rights for the corproate slime that needs to be overruled.

</quote>
Nope, but thanks for once again proving you don't have the slightest clue as to what the Citizens United ruling was about.

The 14th Amendment was not mentioned once in the decision, while the 1st Amendment is cited 12 times.

This was a case about freedom of speech, and freedom of speech won.

I would like to know who specifically (by name) is in this "mafia" and what crimes they should be prosecuted for based on the the New York City criminal code, the New York State criminal code and/or the criminal code of the United States. Specific offenses by section number will be fine.
