Dear Helen Killer,

I love your site and was thrilled to hear of your win against PayPal. I recently had a heartbreaking experience of my own with them.

I sold an old French violin to a buyer in Canada, and the buyer disputed the label.

This is not uncommon. In the violin market, labels often mean little and there is often disagreement over them. Some of the most expensive violins in the world have disputed labels, but they are works of art nonetheless.

Rather than have the violin returned to me, PayPal made the buyer DESTROY the violin in order to get his money back. They somehow deemed the violin as counterfeit even though there is no such thing in the violin world.

The buyer was proud of himself, so he sent me a photo of the destroyed violin.

I am now out a violin that made it through WWII as well as $2500. This is of course, upsetting. But my main goal in writing to you is to prevent PayPal from ordering the destruction of violins and other antiquities that they know nothing about. It is beyond me why PayPal simply didnt have the violin returned to me.

I spoke on the phone to numerous reps from PayPal who 100% defended their action and gave me the party line.

Basically somebody disputed the label on the $2500 they purchased through Paypal and Paypal forced them to destroy instead of return it. This did not go over very well with the seller, who has already had the violin authenticated.

This is not the first time Paypal has proved itself to be a terrible service. The site this was posted on had other problems with an account being frozen. There was also the famous case in 2004 when Paypal froze an account Lowtax opened for hurricane Katrina relief. In that case Paypal refused to unfreeze the account and also refused to transfer the money to the Red Cross because of a business deal it had made with United Way.

In that sense this is just the latest in a very long string of poor public relation and customer service incidents but this one is one of the stupider ones I've seen.

Why would the violin need to be destroyed? Why does Paypal only require the customer to launch a complaint for the violin to be destroyed?

I don't understand.

-Person sells buyer an antique violin
-Buyer claims it is not authentic, so he/she sends a request for money back
-Paypal says "Nope, you have to destroy it first to prove whether or not it is authentic"
-Man does what they says, proving that the violin is authentic... and then he gets his money back for it not being authentic?

Huh?

The moral of this story, is that much like lending money to friends, never let paypal deal with more of your money than you are willing to lose. Also something about getting ripped off by people you don't know on the internet.

The bigger question is, why do people continue to do business via Paypal? I refuse to send or receive money via that service due to the sheer number of horror stories I've heard about them. It gives me just as good a reason never to use Ebay.

This is the first instance I've heard of Paypal requiring the destruction of property, but at this point nothing surprises me about that outfit.

I don't understand why the buyer didn't just return the money and send the violin back without involving paypal? It seems like the best option would have been something like "Hey, I think this violin is fake and Paypal is saying I have to destroy it to get my money back. If I return it, could you return my money?" Instead he decided to break a work of art, take pictures, and get his money back, then send them to the seller too to boast? What kind of loving sociopath bought this violin?

So really, the guy just stole 2500 bucks from this woman under PayPal's supervision? Or he bought a lovely violin, took the tag off the antique and put it on a similar looking violin, and broke that one so he got his money back and an antique violin?

Unfortunately, if you are a collector, Ebay is a great source for things and you more or less have to use Paypal with it. I just hold my nose and never buy anything worth more than I am willing to lose.

It seems like a lovely policy that only exists due to pure laziness/cheapness. I'm guessing they require the buyer to destroy the item, so they don't have to deal with the seller demanding they get their item back, while still preventing people from completely scamming the system to get free stuff.
