Care to provide a citation of the paper which predicted it?

I will wait with abated breath and expect to become very smurfish before receiving a reply.

It goes back to Arrhenius at the turn of the 20thCE and is obvious given the physical principles involved. He, of course, thought it was a purely technical point for a distant future, living in a time when cars and electric power-grids were a novelty and powered flight was still a pipe-dream. As a Swede he also thought warming might be rather a good thing.)

Subsequently there was the work by Callendar and Plass and a growing awareness in the scientific community through the 60's and 70's that AGW was a near-term issue. This emerged onto the more general scene in the 80's. It has, of course, proved to be a near-term issue because here it is in 2010. Hardly surprising given that the laws of physics dictate it and aren't mysteriously different when applied to climate.

I see no predictions at all. I see no citations at all. Care to provide them?

Assess the other variables first, then I'll separate it out for you.

And don't tell me you can't do that.

I am taking the time to point out what you claim regarding CO2 has not been done despite your assertions. You agree CO2 has not been separated out. You agree that other factors can change the expected result completely. Yet you insist increasing CO2 has caused and will continue to cause warming.

How can you honestly make such claims?

There's no brief for the other variables either, by your logic, CO 2 being a variable like any other. It's a well-tried strategy when briefed for defence to claim that the crime is a complete mystery. Juries don't always buy it.

The argument for CO 2 having a role in climate is based on laws of physics which are used widely in other fields. What argument do you have that these laws do not apply in the atmosphere and oceans of this planet? Which is, after all, where climate happens, and coincidentally where we live.

I point you have agreed there is no way to know and that you certainly do not know what the effect of all the variables will be.

To remind you of a previous post, greenhouses work by trapping warm air not by trapping infrared.

The climate of Europe has been both warmer and cooler than it is today without burning fossil fuels.

The world's climate is not static. It is always changing.

And that is why you have to agree there is no way to determining the contribution of CO2 from fossil fuels.

Assumption by whom? Current global warming is explained by human activity, and was in fact predicted (using non-esoteric laws of physics) before the event.

</quote>
When you get around to producing a proper citation of that prediction we can discuss your claims about it. As you have not we cannot hold a discussion based upon your belief in a fulfilled prediction which so far as I know does not exist.

Please produce it or stop predicating your statements on the false assumption that there was in fact a fulfilled prediction.

I got my BS in physics from the U of Cincinnati in 1967.

Try this <a href="http://www.aip.org/history/climate/index.htm">http://www.aip.org/history/climate/index.htm</a>

Predictions of global warming due to an enhanced greenhouse effect have been public since Margaret Thatcher first raised the issue. That's why the IPCC was created and why Hansen was asked to testify on the subject before Congress. I'm surprised that anyone literate could have missed it all.

There's no denial without a claim, and surely nobody can have missed the denial over the last few decades. It doesn't even require literacy to watch Fox News or tune-in to Rush Limbaugh.
