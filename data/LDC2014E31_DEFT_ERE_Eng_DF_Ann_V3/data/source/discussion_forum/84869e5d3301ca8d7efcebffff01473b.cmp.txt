Hi there.

Have your children ever had to talk to Cafcass about their access with the non-resident parent? Did it go OK? Was it as gruelling for them as I'm imagining? Did the report actually reflect what they wanted?

We're off to Cafcass tomorrow morning...

Thank you. <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/smile.gif"/>

Not mine, but my brothers children had to go. My brother is an Alcoholic, with 2 daughters from 2 different marriages. When his second marriage broke down (through his drinking, though he started the divorce proceedings stating his wife was violent, even though HE had smashed up their house!), both daughtes had to go to CAFCASS for inteviews. The older (just 16 now) had a nice sit down chat in a nice room, she didn't really like it, but it wasn't like an interrogation or anything (her words). The younger one (just 3) had her 'interview' with lots of toys, there was no sitting down, making her talk and posing questions, it was done in a very relaxed sort of way, I don't think she even noticed!!
The CAFCASS website details very well how they interview children of different ages-there is even a section there for children to read themselves to put their minds at rest. Have a look, it helped me not to worry before my nieces went.

The reports were very much what they had said. CAFCASS is impartial, and work for the childs interests, not those of the parents.
