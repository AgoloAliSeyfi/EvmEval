It seems like every time something goes on between my husband and I that his friends have to get involved or make rude comments. Greg wanted to go buy a headset for his xbox that is $60 dollars. As of right now, we have about $60 in our account, and his check is going to be maybe $200 since he hasn't been working much. I told him no because we really need to start saving, we have NOTHING. Well he was talking to his friend about it and I saw the text messages...His friend has the nerve to tell him to "man up". MAN UP?! First of all, he may work for the money, but that doesn't make the money just his. We have a family now, and were all entitled to that money. Excuse me for wanting to save and not spend it on STUPID CRAP. It seems like every time I make any decision with money he has a friend telling him to not be a little "bitch".

Am I wrong for being upset? I just feel like its really NONE of their business to open their mouths, especially the ones that aren't married. I'm so annoyed. Husband is mad at me now because he thinks I shouldn't let it bother me, but it does, because every time we fight his friends opinion somehow come into our argument.

IM SO ANNOYED!!!

I dont think you are wrong at all. Bill is the bread winner of our family aswell.. even though I do work, but he is the one that pays the majority of our bills. Fact is though, even though that paycheck has his name on the top of it.. he made the decision when he got me pregnant and when he proposed to me, to be the man of my life. That means that his money is OUR money and same goes for mine. I dont make major investments withough speaking to him and I expect the same respect from him. There are times, especially when we are pregnant, that we have to prioritize. X box headsets are not a must... diapers, wipes, formula, clothing, toys... those things are "must haves". Men tend to not think with level heads... so we have to think for them. His friends have no right sticking their noses in your business either- hearing that pisses even me off and Im not there to deal with it <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/mad.gif"/>. I had this problem with my DF and I told him straight up.. "Im not playing these bullshit games... its me or your friends. If you choose them.. then pack your stuff and I'll see you in court...otherwise this engagement and this family will be just You, Me, and Conner." I didnt agree to marry his pathetic worthless friends... I agreed to marry him. Your husband's friend was right.. he does need to "Man up"... he needs to "man up" and take responisibilty for his family. He needs to be making money and prioritizing and quit worrying about x-box! Hope things get better for you Kim. Ya know there are times when I read your stories that I get soooooo mad at your husband for putting you through this drama! <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/frown.gif"/>

Hell no you're not wrong for being upset! If we had $60 in the account and he was wanting to spend it, omg, I would be furious...I am furious for you! One, my husband woudn't even have the balls to even ask that question, and two, if he had a friend like that I GUARENTEE, he would NOT be hanging around him anymore!
