ah MP.. that must've been incredibly hard for you... how did you cope?
It's so hard to know why they do this...we bring them up and feel we have done our best, just to get it all taken away as if I am just some friend on facebook he can delete!

I am SO pleased for you that your daughter came back, it must have been hard not to ever question her why though.
I don't think they can ever realise how hurtful this is.

Hope is good.... thank you xxx

Minxz, it was hard, incredibly hard, she was also in contact with other members of my family but they didnt tell me how she was unless I asked. I cant tell you the buckets of tears I have cried. I suspect that she blamed me for leaving her dad as he was very handy with his fists, after all, every child wants their parents to be together no matter what is going on.

I used to think of her when she was a little girl and she needed me for everything and we did everything together. These memories kept me going.

I think that age and maturity came into the situation once she had met her OH. When you grow up, and I mean really grow up (I.E. relationships, money, jobs, motgage etc) you see things from a much different perspective. I think this is what happened in my daughters case and it will happen to your son too. Please dont give up, but get on with your life and enjoy your other children. I only have one child as I lost one to cot death and one I miscarried, so her rejection of me was all the more upsetting. There is hope and I pray that your son will see sense. Am sending you my good wishes.

I was estranged from my parents for a while, due to them refusing to meet or accept a boyfriend. It was very difficult for all concerned and I know my Mum had lots of sleepless nights over me. It's fair to say that she also said things about me being bad with money, into drugs that were very hurtful and just not true. Meanwhile I was buying my first house, building my life and being independent.

She always wanted me to do what she wanted me to do and oddly enough, I wanted to be my own person.

I can still feel that feeling of letting her down because she wants me to do something else than the perfectly tidy and respectable life I have chosen for myself. My friends laugh when I say I am the black sheep of the family because you'd need some very snowy white sheep in a family for me to be the black sheep. But I am older now, in my mid thirties, and able to move on and bite my tongue sometimes. Over Christmas we did have a bit of a row because of something stupid she said to try and wind me up and I bit (it was a touchy subject).

I think you have to let your son be and contact him quarterly rather than weekly. Be glad he still sees his grandparents. I managed to maintain contact with mine which was very importnat to me. And remember that he probably doesn't think about you only because it hurts too much if he does, and he won't block it out for ever, but he needs to acheive what he wants to acheive and you just need to let him....

Thank you... Good to hear things are getting back to normal with your family, despite you having to bite your tongue. I often did that with my son.. he was a tearaway when he was a teenagers, and I have tried hard to forget his past, and I told him only 2 days before he did all this how v v proud i was of him, how he's the first in the family to graduate ( I doubt I'll be there now... he graduates this year, and I know I'll be cut to bits if I am not invited!) and we had the most lovely phone call, so another reason why i truly can't understand his sudden behaviour.
I am not a perfect mum, i get things wrong like we all do... but i never stifl the kids, I don't impose my expectations on them ( only that they try their best for what they want in life).. but the way he's acting you'd think i was the worse ' jeremy Kyle' type mother around!
Thanks,

Having known the OP for some years I can hand on heart say that this couldn't be further from the truth. It's easy to try &amp; blame the parents but gosh, I'd feel my kids were doing well if I was half the parent OP is. When I think of all she has done for her kids over the years, they way she has been there for them through thick &amp; thin. I consider myself blessed to know the OP &amp; she has taught me a lot about unconditional love. I know it's hard when you only get a small snippet of a story so can understand why you said what you did so I'm not having a go at you. I know the OP doesn't need me to say anything, she is more than capable of explaning things herself but I didn't just want to read &amp; run as I'd feel I wasn't being a good friend to let that comment go without saying something.

Better go &amp; PM the OP now so she knows who I am <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/smile.gif"/>
