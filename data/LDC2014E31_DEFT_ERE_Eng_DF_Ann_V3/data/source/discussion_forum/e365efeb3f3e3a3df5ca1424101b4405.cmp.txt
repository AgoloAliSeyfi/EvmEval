Yeah, and a crowd of idiots turned up in Dublin as well.

The burn everything British brigade up on their soapbox were performing to an empty house (bar some amused passers by).

West Brit. I love that phrase and I've even grown to love it as an insult hurled against me by you. I might embrace the tag 'West Brit' just because it annoys and rattles folk like yourself to your very core - which is a bonus and very amusing. The Good Friday Agreement has put all the prior issues to bed and unless you were personally affected by "700 years" of British oppression ( Remember they were invited in here in the first place ) then you choose to get upset at this and give it a meaning that it does not have. A friendly state visit - nothing more.

Angela Merkel can go to Moscow and meet Vladamir Putin when 70 years ago 20 million Russians were slaughtered and their country destroyed and take a phone call from Sarkozy after occupying France 1940 -1945. The English could not give a damn about Northern Ireland, 80% want it to leave the union! It is only in the United Kingdom because of the lunatic loyalist community - I pity the UK having to deal with the whole issue. The six counties are not occupied, the majority of the population wish to be part of the UK, and until that changes, it will be part of the UK. There is no 'occupation', in fact, most of the 5,000 British troops officially based in Northern Ireland have been deployed to Afghanistan, so they are actually occupying someone elseâ€™s country. I'm honestly not that bothered about the Queen, but her visit does have it's benefits - It will rattle cavemen like yourself to your very core. Best iron the Celtic jersey and practice setting fire to wheelie bins eh?

First sentence. You called a lot of people idiots. You haven't shown yourself to be be a genius on this forum anyway., so its a bit rich.

Second paragraph makes absolutely no sense tbh. Mindless mutterings...

A lot of your third paragraph makes little sense too. Proud to be a west brit. God help you ffs. Invited in? Right I think you need to re read that part of history. How can the head of the army that occupies our country come on a friendly state visit lol??? The same army that has committed countless war crimes in our land. A member of the monarchy responsible for the Irish Genocide? Not to mention the war crimes her "troops" carry out across the world like in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.

Merkel isn't head of the NAZI government and Putins not the head of the USSR so that statement is redundant. That was a war that is long over. In Ireland the occupation still exists. Now some brainless muttering about soccer team and bins that are irrelevant to this thread. Can you really not stay on topic?

Yeah, everyone is confused bar you!

Let's face it, when taking the Irish national opinion and attitude towards the Queen's visit to Ireland - the rug was pulled from under the barstoolers by an 84 year old woman. Very bad news for frothing at the mouth types who want to live in 1973 forever, Celtic will lose a few games, The Wolf Tones now will go techno and maybe finish them off.

At present there is a majority unionist population in the north, and it probably won't last too much longer but obviously it will still be a sizeable proportion of the population. Now you want a united Ireland (as do I actually) but what happens with the unionists? Much as you might say they were planted or whatever, the fact is they are there and their traditions have to be taken into account and the actions of the lunatic loyalist paramilitaries must be taken into account as well. The reason we had the troubles in the first place was because one crowd was stamping all over the other. A united Ireland now will only come about through a referendum and some unionists are going to have to vote for it to make it a reality. So really it is not up to the queen if the north is given back or not but when she visits (like she did this year) it might well make the unionist population not so suspicious of the Republic as they used to be.

Yet again, you have god way off topic and started talking about, barstools, soccer teams and bands ffs. What is wrong with you?

The unionists are treated the same as every other citizen of the country. Why would they get any different treatment lol. The British Government which the queen is the head of has the power to pull all its troops out and remove all its governmental representatives here.

Genuine question, why do the Irish usually blame England for what's happening and not Britain collectively (with Wales &amp; Scotland)?

</quote>

Yes it was the England who invaded and occupied. The Scots and Welsh where also occupied.

England was also invaded and occupied by various groups of people over history. England became England largely through conquest.
