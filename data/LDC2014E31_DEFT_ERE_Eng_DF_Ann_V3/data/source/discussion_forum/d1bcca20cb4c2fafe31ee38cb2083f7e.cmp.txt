Well the suposedly communist states are largely what i, and i think most others, see as the natural result of the application of authoritarian marxist dogma, that being, that the transitional state proposed, the dictatorship of the proletariat, would naturally result in such vile pseudo-socialist despots. I rather adhere to libertarian socialism / anarchism who oppose such, and did so before it even bore practice. In fact, Bakunin in the 19th century made, what i think are, some of the only accurate predictions to occur in the social sciences in his critique of marxism, claiming; "take the most radical revolutionary and place him on the throne of all russia, or give him a dictatorial power, and before a year has passed he will become worse than the tsar himself"; "the red bureacracy would prove the most vile and terrible lie of the century."

I don't think authoritarian marxism works in theory or practice (although i think marxism provides valuable means of critiquing and understanding capitalism), i think communism, predominantly anarcho-communism or even left-communism / council communism works in theory, but it has yet to be attempted, unless you count the anarcho-syndicalism of Eastern Spain.

State socialism has been practiced widely, such as the 21st century socialism of the ALBA states of Latin America. I don't think libertarian-socialism has boar practice on a nation-state level, but it has found practice in the Spanish Revolution, the Free Territory of Ukraine with regards to the Makhnovists, the Kibbutz of Israel, the Paris Commune and other such occurrences.

Do you subscribe to an ideology?

Excellent, I'll look into that.

What you've said is fascinating - I've actually met quite a few people with your views. With the Cyprus problem and all, we have significant numbers of people from all parts of the political spectrum.

Personally I'm not politically aligned just yet, it's an issue I'm only now looking into.

WHY DO PEOPLE KEEP SAYING THIS? How is China communist?

Does it matter if they are technically communist? The average person thinks they are communists, and that's who the right-wing propaganda ensnares.

They aren't.

Even if this is true, which i think is highly contestable, it's irrelevant to what they are. The numerical weight of opinion has no sway on the truth.

Perhaps, but it doesn't affect what they are.

The general consensus is that "Chinese? They're communists aren't they?" And unfortunately no enlightened TSRian is going to be around to correct them. It makes no difference whether they're technically communists or not(and I personally wouldn't know how to tell)

Oddly I have never seen that in the media. <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/> the only thing I read about them is their booming economics and other good **** we hear. Maybe I have been following at the wrong type of media?

I think the media is demonizing China. The often just post pictures about the rebel instead of some solider helping people to overcome problems, such as earthquake

Is this the same China that lends unassailable support to the prison state of North Korea? Omar al-Bashir's genocidal Sudanese government? The Iranian theocracy? The Than Shwe junta in Myanmar? The same China that has repeatedly laid claims to Taiwan? The same China responsible for the slaughter of hundreds of Uighers in the north-west last year? This is without mentioning the censorship, the routine execution of mentally retarded foreign nationals, the lack of democratic mandate and arrest of political dissidents, etc. Are you telling me that a rising power with such an appalling human rights record shouldn't be demonised?
