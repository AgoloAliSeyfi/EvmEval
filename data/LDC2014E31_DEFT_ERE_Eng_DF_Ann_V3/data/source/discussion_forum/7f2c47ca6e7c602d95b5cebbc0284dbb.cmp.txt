fox news is balanced somewhere between rightwingnut and malitia audiance

More proof that the administration was absolutely right in their assertions that Foxnews is NOT a news organization.

Maybe this incident will compel the administration to man up and knock Fox, and the rest of the rightwing propaganda machine, on its ass.

Even if this assertion about Oreilly is correct... he is not a newscaster. He is a commentator giving his opinion. He should still be accurate with his opinion, but he isn't a newscaster.

Shirley Sherrod, we now know that her video was edited, yet it was played on Fox again and again. And when poor Shirley was forced to resign, Fox comes out with a report, just tonight, that Obama threw an "innocent" woman under the bus. Now, Fox says she's innocent. Only now.

Except, you have zero evidence that Fox even played the clip until after the Administration forced her to resign over it. In fact, watching Fox will tell you the exact opposite of what you are claiming.

Of course, you will continue to pretend Fox has been attacking her all along. But the fact is, you idiots fired her before anyone knew about the story.

Not to mention... on the local news today, they had a caller trying to defend this racist bitch saying "she was taken out of context"... the problem is that she sure reveled in riling up the crowd with her story of 'sticking it to this white farmer'... and the crowd would not be knowing that she would be adding more at the end, was SURE APPLAUDING her story of what she did... showing even more the racist bullshit of the NAACP

But we will have the leftists defending racism once again, as long as it is within their ranks

The USDA and the NAACP should have verified the story before they jumped the gun and threw Ms Sherrod under the bus.

They only checked it after they drove that big ass bus over Ms. Sherrod.

Then, Golly Gee, Whoops, they found the story was taken out of context. OOOPPPPSSS.

Now of course its everyones fault but their own.

Always easy to blame others for your ineptitude.

Typical. Jeeze.

There was the problem for the NAACP in that they had just cast out the charge that the Tea Party was 'racist,' and didn't want to be tarred with the same brush...

And the administration had been so thoroughly dinged by exposures of prior vetting errors that that sought to end the episode quickly...Anita Dunn follows Mao, and Van Jones claims to be a communist...

sort of hoist by their own petard, huh?

And the irony is that Glenn Beck outflanks them! He indicated that the official was not behaving in a 'racist' manner.

</quote>

You're absolutely right that it was the worst kind of rush to judgment which was made based on past performance BY FOX. Why is it Fox needs to keep some obscure "story" alive for weeks on end, such as the Van Jones thing? What is THEIR "intent"?? Within the realm of national priorities, that issue should have been a back page two-liner, but Fox managed to build it into such a big deal that The Stupids assumed the Constitution would soon be replaced by the Communist Manifesto.

C'mon...grow up.

You angry leftists are so quick to throw not only the 'racist' accusation, but the word 'lie'.

Now, here you are challenged to prove the lie charge, and you are unable to do so.

Were I a leftist, I would, of course, accuse you of 'lying' with your charge, as it is clear that the video provided in post #14 is in no way a lie, nor could you misunderstand my post which indicated that the vid was dispositive as to Fox being fair.

So, I'll simply leave you with the brand of immature, angry, sophomoric, spittle-spewing, left wing janissary, infused with the desire to paint opponents with vituperation, rather than banter about the value of each others' ideas.

There, now, isn't that more literate than 'lying racist'...

what? you don't believe FOX NEWS?

FOX news says themselves that they REPORTED IT FIRST.

<quote>
The Agriculture Department announced Monday, shortly after FoxNews.com published its initial report on the video, that Sherrod had resigned.

Try to read the entire thread before post, as it will make you appear less silly.

The point here was not whether or not Fox News went with the story, but, that, in a fair and balanced manner, the Glenn Beck Show put the story in its correct context.

Note post #14 above.

What choice did he have by then?
