My engagement ring/wedding ring and other personal ring along with my husband's wedding ring was stolen. At least we assume so.

We went camping and put them together in the car. After camping and coming home we searched high and low and could not find them. We called the campgrounds and the owners said they had cleaned our campsite and did not find anything.

So we had to assume some one stole them. We did have the car unlocked at times so it is a definate possibility. Really stinks at it was just our anniversary right before.

@Linkat,

Yep, that stinks. We were robbed one time right before Christmas. Came home, and the basement door had been kicked in. All they took were wrapped Christmas gifts, and all of my husband's socks. Sounds funny now, but at the time I felt very violated at the thought of strangers going through my house.

@mags314772,

Yes I can say the one thing was at least it wasn't in my house. The idea of some one going through your house is as bad as them taking Christmas presents.
