I am so glad you brought this up.

The Republican Party is anti women. No question.

They want to cut funds for Planned Parenthood which provides health services for women.

They want to destroy teachers unions, and most teachers are women.

They want to take away a women's right to chose, and force women to have unwanted children.

Is there no evil in the world that the Republican Party won't support?

You didn't address it!

You tried to (lamely) to DEFLECT away from the issue with a lot of laughable accusations.

A) Planned Parenhood was a racist organization started by Margaret Sanger to sterilize blacks. (Fact)

<a href="http://www.blackgenocide.org/negro.html">BlackGenocide.org | The Negro Project</a>

<a href="http://www.mcculloughsite.net/stingray/2009/01/22/the-negro-project-exterminating-the-black-pop.php">The Negro Project: Exterminating the black population - Stingray</a>

B) Planned Parenthood engages in the murder of thousands of females every year and YOU libs talk about misogyny??????

C) Are you suggesting ONLY women work for Unions????

Very misogynist of YOU!

D) I find it very funny that you talk about a "woman's right to choose" in the same breath and saying women SHOULDN'T HAVE A RIGHT TO CHOOSE how those children they CHOOSE GET EDUCATED thanks to the Teachers Union.

You're all over the map and you still won't address how women were treated by Bill Clinton and his goons.

An embryo is not a person, therefore abortion is not "murder."

If it were then the tens of thousands of frozen embryos in labs across the country would be people.

Unwanted children are MUCH more likely to be abused, so if you are against abortion, you are pro child abuse. Think about that.

And 76% of public school teachers are women. So anti teacher is anti women.

These issues are much bigger than Bill Clinton's issues with women. But you guys have so little left in your clue bag, that you have to go back to Bill Clinton.

A)WHEN DID YOUR LIFE BEGIN GENIUS?

I don't care how you libs try to twist and turn and spin, I'm pretty damn sure there is one event YOU ALL HAVE IN COMMON.

That is the CONCEPTION BY YOUR PARENTS!

Until you libs can prove otherwise, then I'm pretty damn sure that's when ALL YOUR WORTHLESS LIVES BEGAN!

But life doesn't begin with conception?

Where does it begin, with magic liberal fairies raining welfare and foodstamps dust on y'all?

Idiots!

B) ARE YOU SUGGESTING ONLY EMBRYOS ARE ABORTED?

Dude you cannot be that stupid. An unborn baby at 7 weeks already has a hear beat. THAT ISN'T AN EMBRYO.

My first child at 12 weeks (in her ultrasound) was already sucking her thumb. That's not an embryo.

Liberals are still trying to get the partial birth abortion ban overturned, and in the 90s were justifying that attrocity as needed to guard the "health of the mother."

That's no freaking embryo we are talking about with partial birth abortion.

SO YOU ARE FULL OF IT, talking about "embryos!" Good grief. Did you actually think that BULLSHIT was going to work? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/new/lmao.gif"/>

C) The Teachers Union isn't the ONLY UNION being dealt with, so nice try but you are just trying to hide behind the Teacher's Union.

D) "Bigger issues" than Bill Clinton?" Or you know damn well all your talk about caring about women falls flat IF YOU ADDRESS BILL CLINTON?

I'm still waiting for you phony liberals to address how many future women are killed each year IN abortions!

Now there is a nice "non sexist" term. Glad you could stop by the misogyny thread and drop that little bomb for us all to witness. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

I have a theory.

Misogynist Lefties use the words "twat" and "cunt" as insults because they feel sexually inferior and are actually afraid of Real Women (and they have Mommy Issues).

I think you got something there!

Anti women, anti gay, racist bigots?

You just described the Republican Party!

</quote>

If only the republicans didn't want sara palin or michelle bachman as their president
If only bush didn't have the most minorities in his cabinet of any president prior to him
If only herman cain and alan west weren't both supported by the teapartiers and republicans.

Sorry man but reality clashes with that old, worn out, and innacurate talking point.

I'm glad you brought this up.

There are a lot of similarities between the Republican Party and Islam.

They both are anti women, they both are anti gay, and they both are racist.

And they both love their guns and their religion.

Notice every time you bring up something that refutes the liberal idea of conservative women, Chris says "I'm glad you brought that Up" and then rattles off a string of total BS about the Republican party?
