No, you don't, you make blanket statements about a diverse region.

You're changing the subject - we are not talking about whether its justified. You said Iran respects its neighbours - that is patently false: it funds another bunch of backward mongrels. This is nothing to do with what America does but your statement that Iran "respects" neighbours. Please stay on topic.

And just so you know, America funded 7 groups under the umbrella of the Mujahadeen - the Taliban came into existence in 1994, with some of the members of the Mujahadeen.

Like I said, you're taking a man's words and putting them above his actions toward his own people.

Any book on the Middle East.

Read the quote I gave. And read the article which shows that the majority of Arabs believe Iran to be a greater risk than Israel.

How do you not think funding the Taliban is causing turbulence in the region? It has to do with the risk to the region because it creates instability. To the statement in bold: pure ignorance. This isn't just about Shia control, its about Iranian dominance.

the "majority of arabs" from your claim see iran as a greater threat than israel. I would say this is because of the shia threat to the sunni islam.....

iranian dominance will mean shia control.....

Is this a serious question? Are you being serious!?

Not saying the fundamental reason for the war on terror was religion but rather procurement of natural resources and geo-political dominance…. If it was all about 9/11 and the extremist Islamic jihadi ideology, they should have been banging on the door of the Saudis who are the sellers of wahabi islam which preaches this whole Islamic jihadi crazy loony things we have become so familiar with… and of course deal with Pakistan (but we know they can’t because they are a “soverign” nation – means they have nukes!)
</quote>

Exactly! I said this to you: if it was all about religion and war, they would have gone for Saudi! There's oil there and, as you said, there is as much Islamic radicalism there! It disproves your point!

<quote>
LOL! You’re still going on about the Iranian culture issue…. I never said stoning was part of Iranian culture (however long that culture is)…. The practice of stoning/hanging etc is part of Islamic law which some muslims countries follow…
</quote>

I am going to quote you: "I haven’t condoned iran’s laws… I said I don’t agree with them.. barbariac to us in the Christian west. But it is part of their culture "

<img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/> You don't even know what you're saying.

‘How iran behaves now’…. What exactly has iran done (apart from funding various groups fighting against America/Zionists). Iran hasn’t threatened an arab nation…. They are funding groups which fight Americans/Zionists..
</quote>

<img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rofl.gif" alt=":rofl:"/> "Apart from funding various groups" - they destabilise the region you lunatic! They not only "fight Americans and Zionists" - they fights against the will of the Afghan population. What else have they done apart from undermining their Afghan neighbours? Abu Musa. Leaving aside the threat they post to all the other regimes in the Arab world with their hegemony and ability to start strife.

<quote>
My every point doesn’t have to contradict what you say… my point was just that it is all going to depend if you have an inclination to support sunnis/shias etc…. The middle east doesn’t want a shia nation to become powerful…. You agree perhaps because you have an affinity for arabs/sunnis….. I side with the Iranians because I tend to back the underdogs… and in the whole arab/Persian – sunni/shia, the shias are the underdogs….Oh look, I’m making childlike comments again…
</quote>

I have no affinity with anyone - where the hell are you getting this from?! I'm a Zionist, I don't particularly want any of them to get powerful. I am saying this because of what I have quoted - which you continue to ignore.

<quote>
They are only disrespecting the “puppet afghan gov”, as after all claims of being a new American installed democracy showed that karzai was involved in vote rigging and has clouds of corruption allegations over his head…
</quote>

Corruption is bad, yes but that doesn't mean you turn to fighting an even more corrupt inhumane organisation. The Afghan population does not want the Taliban.

<quote>
Iran has never “disrespected” Afghanistan…. They are allies…. I’m sure they share “blood”…. They are fighting against an American installed gov…. If your claim that iran are a threat is on the basis that they fund the Taliban that’s why they are a threat to the arab nations is ridiculous.
</quote>

Ridiculous. They are fighting against the Afghans when they fund the Taliban. Do you know what the Taliban did to the population? Do you honestly believe they want them back? And its not an "American installed government" - its one that has been voted for by the Afghan population. And no, Afghanistan is distinct from the Arab world - which you would have realised if you had actually read my posts. When it funds the Taliban, it not only destabilises the government, it funds a backward bunch of barbarians.
