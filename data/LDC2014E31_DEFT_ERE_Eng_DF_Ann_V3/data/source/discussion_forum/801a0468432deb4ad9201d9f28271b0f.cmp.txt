I've been with my boyfriend since I was 16 years old. He was my first serious boyfriend, he'd been with somebody for 2 years before me.

Things got pretty full on, pretty quick, we never really 'dated' we was just all of a sudden a full on couple.

I was very naive at 16, as I say, first relationship. Looking back, he treated me appaulingly. He did physically hurt me, not punches, but he throw things at me, caused massive bruises on my arms (which I then had to cover up infront of family) and I remember him grabbing hold of the back of my neck and twisting it so it bruised. At the time, I knew it was wrong, but I was so stupid I just go on with it. It was never anything major and probably happened less than 5 times in the first year of our relationship.

For the first 1-2 years he HATED me going out with my friends. During this time I was at college. He said he found it hard to trust me because his ex cheated on him. Again I was naive, I fell for it. I stopped going out with friends who I had been friends with all the way through school.

When it came to me choosing universities, he told me I would have to stay here, or we would have to split up. I fell for it AGAIN, I didn't want to split up, I loved him, so I never moved away like my friends did.

My boyfriend swears A LOT. He doesn't just swear in conversation, he swears at me, and gets really aggressive. I guess I've just got used to it, but it just makes me so embarrased.

We've been together 4 years now, and I really do just feel so down.

I am very lonely. I probably have 2 or 3 friends. Everybody else got so fed up of asking me to go out and me saying no that I think they just gave up on me.

My sister is getting ready to go to uni and I really am starting to resent him for how my life is now. I am stuck at home, still living with my parents and my life could have been so different.

I know I don't want to be in this relationship. I can not imagine myself marrying him, or having kids with him (though thats what I want more than anything else in the world, but with the right man!) but if I aren't with him, I literally have no one at all. If it wasn't him I would be stuck in 24/7. I have very few friends, and my 'best' friend is tied down with kids and a house etc. He's got me right were he wants me.

He's walked out tonight, we've been arguing over little things for a few days, and he was supposed to be staying in to talk tonight, but insterad he's gone to football. I told him not to come back, but I know yet again I will take him back.

I know this is just a load of jumbled rubbish but I'm so down and fed up with this <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/frown.gif"/> I've probably brought it all on myself, but I just cannot see what to do next.

I've been here before, with someone much older, and it won't get any better.

You're not stupid, just young and vulnerable. Change your phone number, get in touch with your old friends (it won't be easy to do, but they will be glad you're free of him!) and if needs be move away. You deserve better. Pm me if you need to talk more x

I was in a bad relationship in my early 20's (although never physical). I actually married the guy &amp; 18 months on he left me. I took him back &amp; he left again, I said to him if he went I would not take him back...it was the hardest thing I ever did because at that point I still loved him. But what I said to myself was "do I deserve this for the rest of my life or do I deserve better?"

I went out &amp; found new friends. I got back in contact with old friends who were so happy to see me. I did things for me.

18 months later I met a new man. 14 years later I am still with him &amp; we are so happy. I do not regret what I went through - it makes me realise how lucky I am with my OH.

So ask yourself "do I deserve this for the rest of my life or do I deserve better?"...I bet you already know the answer.

Why are you wasting your life on this viscious, useless waste of space ?
You're better off without him in your life, and you'll have a life.

dont call yourself stupid - youre not - just, as you say, naive. as a parent and grandma can I give you some advice hun? you say youre living at home with your parents. And he has walked out to go to footy? Pack his stuff up - put it outside and Lock the door and sit mum and dad down and TELL them what has really been going on in the relationship...if it was my daughter he wouldnt set foot in MY house again!!! this person is only going to get worse - not better. and tbh - once you do have kids - you will feel even more trapped. you are not married to him - you are still living at home. You CAN get out of the relationship and rebuild your life.
