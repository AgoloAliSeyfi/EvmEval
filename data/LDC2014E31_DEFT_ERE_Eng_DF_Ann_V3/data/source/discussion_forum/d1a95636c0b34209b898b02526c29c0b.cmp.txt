And I think I like him... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/confused.gif"/>

Hey, the man seems like the real deal. I lived in New Jersey from ages 0 to 27, just missing his tenure by about 4 months. Thus, I haven't studied him much, since he's of no consequence to me anymore - I'm out of New Jersey and I will never return, unless I become so rich that I can afford a middle-class home there (Even then not so sure I'll ever return). The man seems like a straight-shooter. The interview was refreshing. You can bet I'll be looking into this man and reporting back.

Current Jersey natives; Particularly those of you to the left of the spectrum (Winger?). Where you guys at on this guy? Surely you can't deny some of what he says makes sense.

I liked Christie when he was a federal prosecutor. He held back no punches in going after corrupt politicians. So far, I think he is doing a good job but needs to be able to work better with others if he expects to get things done.
He tends to bully the opposition and does not have the political clout to follow through

But given the poor performance of our recent Governors, he is a breath of fresh air

Yup.

I like a straight shooter and Christie is certainly that. I would like him no matter what party he represented.

I sure hope he can straighten NJ out and give the residents of that State a much needed break on the taxes.

I've lived in the garden state for over 30 years and despite the high cost of living, the corruption and negative stereotypes, I love living here. Christie is what we need to turn all that around, but I hope its not too late. He's proposing a state takeover of Atlantic City, and a drastic measure like that, makes me fear that the economic situation is even worse than we are being told. Opponents accuse him of fear mongering. I fear he's actually holding back.

I thought Atlantic City was taken over by Trenton years ago! I had a project in Atlantic City that had me living there for a year and a half. That was back in 1998-1999.

There was a massive snow and ice storm that winter and AC had no means of removing the snow. New Jersey paid to have the AC Expressway cleared, as well as Georgia Avenue. But, that's it! I had to go to a city council meeting to request a street closure for 48 hours during my project. City Council couldn't grant the request until it was filed in Trenton.

AC couldn't even post a stop sign without approval from Trenton!

Anyone who doesn't like what Christie is advocating is a...well, state employee scared the benefits gravy train will be upset before they get to start lapping it up for the rest of their days. And screw them.

Christie is taking on some of the Sacred Cows in NJ Politics

- Teachers Unions
- State Workers unions

If he can make any progress he will be a saint in NJ

I have a problem with anyone spending like a drunken sailor...

Do you believe in spending money we don't have on things like healthscare reform?

If you have a problem with the Bush Deficit, then you should oppose Obama more than Tripling it.

You feeling alright Cuyo? Christie is a conservative you know. It's not like you to think a conservative makes sense.

</quote>

Yes I know, hence the <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/confused.gif"/> in the OP. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

I never said conservatives are always wrong, it's more that some of the arguments I hear in favor of conservatism are so ridiculous, as is the way they frame the liberals.

Most aggravating for me is that so many here on both sides have not an inkling about what either side really represents. It's like a sporting event to such people; They've picked a side ahead of time, and memorized that side's talking points. I could easy name half a dozen from each persuasion that fall into that category here.

As always, I'm on the side of "What makes sense;" and as of right now, Mr. Christie is making a lot of sense to me.

I can totally understand what your saying. But it all makes sense if you look at the thread i started about what everyones motivation is for posting here. Most of it's pride.

I feel like I'm in the twilight zone that there could actually exist a politician who brings people from both sides together.

I'm on neither side. I just like to take shots at one side more than the other, at least at USMB.
