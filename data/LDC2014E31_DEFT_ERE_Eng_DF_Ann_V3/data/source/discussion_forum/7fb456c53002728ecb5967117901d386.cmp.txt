types of people who irrationally mock / hate gold and anybody who mentions it.

1. people with no money to spare ever.
2. people who would lose advantages gained from the current system, banks, governments and their media etc.
3. academia &amp; econ professors (see 1 &amp; 2.)
4. people who are locked into 401k's and cannot easily get out (see 1.)
5. people who are locked into real estate and cannot easily get out (see 1.)
6. people who see, but are too scared to partake (bull market wall of worry)
6. keynesian woo disciples.

that about has it covered, which of these are you all?

I am not any of the above. In fact, I do not have any real objection to gold standard, provided it remains standard. And there is the problem:

<quote orig_author="kevsta">
this nonsense they continually dream up about it being absolutely set in stone that Gold always crashes, when in fact we have a set of exactly one previous case.

</quote>
Actually, "we" (as in, human race) has seen quite a few gold crashes, every time a large new supply was dug out of the ground and dumped onto market. The worst one was Spanish conquest of Mexico -- Spaniards brought so much gold from the New World, they effectively devalued their own treasury and destroyed their own economy. But lesser gold rushes, such as Yukon, did not do the countries involved any good either.

Granted, all easily mined gold has already been mined out. But...

<quote orig_author="psionl0">
We have been through this before. At current prices, there is not enough gold in the world to replace US base money - not to mention the money created by banks (and we haven't even touched on the rest of the world).

To become the world's money supply, the value of gold would have to increase considerably and since much of the world's gold is privately owned, a lot of people are seriously in favour of a gold standard.

Which, I repeat, does not bother me in itself. I do not care whether an ounce of gold buys a moped (which now it does) or a car. But if an ounce of gold buys a car, it becomes a huge incentive to invest in new mining techniques, and to dig MORE gold out of the ground. Which inevitably drops the price, and if the currency is tied to gold causes more market problems. Again.

Which was the point of my OP, which everyone seems to have ignored. My complaint about gold is -- the supply is not fixed, and the more valuable it is, the more likely it is to suddenly increase and devalue.
