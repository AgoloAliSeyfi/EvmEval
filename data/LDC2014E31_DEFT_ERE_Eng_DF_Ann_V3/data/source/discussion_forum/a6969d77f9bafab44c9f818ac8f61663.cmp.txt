Again, a slur against an institution doesn't make you seem intelligent. You are knocking the degrees of thousands across the UK that go to Aberystwyth and universities lower down the table.

I'm glad I'm going to Aber, I'd rather go there than to one of the top universities full of posh *******s who struggle to get laid because they have their head stuck in a book 23 hours a day. You are so up your own ass its unbelievable. Do you think a degree certificate that says Cambridge on it is going to give your prospective employer a boner? No its really not. A degree is only as much worth as the skills you possess to back it up. I would have more chance with a degree from Aberystwyth and a good polished portfolio of getting a job than you would with just a degree from Cambridge. A piece of paper that says a universities name on it is not the be all and end all. I picture you as being this

The fact is Aber has a good employability record as well as good academic reputation in Computer Science. I've been told by top level people at Sony. I think they'd know more than you somehow.

I never claimed to know everything. I just know a lot of advanced things about networking, web design etc.. I know a lot of PHP, not a bit as you claim.

I know little about programming languages like Java, C++ and so on. That is why I am going to university to learn a wider range of things.

May I ask what university you are at or plan to go to?

Also, I didn't format the last part in bold so I did not offend you, you mighty intellectual superior being. Can't offend the super university posh virgin tw@ brigade now can we.

You're a total idiot if you think going to a good university makes you "posh". I'm not rich or posh, I just work hard. You're also an idiot if your think everyone at Cambridge is a virgin, you're doing the geekiest course in existence and since you brought it up I think it's probably more likely you are one. And for the record I have a gf so no i'm not.

And no I don't want to go to a good uni so 'it will give my prospective employer a boner', I want to go to one because they have the best facilities, lectures and research and as an added bonus, no ***** like you.

I hope the same protestoes come out at his sons wedding with the paintballs.
When the queen dies I hope the same protesters again hit the streets, as time is near for a republic.

There is a difference between attacking a car with bulletproof glass with a bit of white paint and attacking two unmasked (and innocent) people with paintballs - the latter is life-threatening if someone gets in a lucky shot.

<quote orig_author="NeoNerd">
It's just appeared on the AP wires and the BBC live coverage. People who spilled over from the "protest" attacked their car as it went down Regent Street. No harm done to them, apparently.

Looks like the mob is spilling over.

Just as an aside, she is not "Camilla Parker Bowles" - as Prince Charles does not have a surname, she is now Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall (technically Camilla, Princess of Wales).

Just to point out that a degree from a top university like Oxbridge does help you get your foot into the door for interviews over other universities. In particular if you look at the top IT firms(I am talking Google/FB/MS here) or IB they do have a very strong preference for graduates from the top universities, some will even mark you down if you aren't from one of their target universities. Also would like to point out that graduate employment figures often only measure the number of graduates in a job, not the firm they are employed in or their salary, or indeed the number of people pursuing further study and are at best to be taken with a pinch of salt.

If it was America and it was the Presidents car and people started smashing it's windows, all kinds of **** would go down. People would probably get shot, riot police would be using tear gas and rubber bullets.

Here the police can't even use baton's in an angry mob of rioters in case someone gets injured.

</quote>

Probably the only way a person would get shot is if he/she pulled a gun on the President, and then more likely he/she would just get tackled.

The police over here are very careful, but considering the assassinations and attempted assassinations in our history, I don't blame them. The President has a very important job to do. Keeping him and his family safe is of top priority (of course the royal family needs to be safe, too).

President Bush also faced protests (this one was after he left office):

No shots fired, just people arrested.
