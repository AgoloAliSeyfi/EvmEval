I'm a wedding planner so....well...I could write a book.
Here's a doosey....
My favorite ever is getting a fax from a groom cancelling his wedding 2 months out at the Hotel I worked at.
Yes, a fax.
Written in huge handwritten letters:
"Cancel the Smith/Reeves wedding ASAP. Return all deposits to me. Signed, The Groom"
Um...ok. No.
The contract stated we keep all deposits made up till that point and anything else stipulated in the contract. I called him and explained it to him. Also explained that payments were made from his credit card and the bride's parents. So he would need to discuss it with her or her lawyer.
Then I get a call from the bride.
She asks me to keep the room reserved...her side of the family was looking into having a family reunion in its place. Fairly common when something like this happens and the client realizes they paid for a room and they might as well use it one way or another.
She asks to keep everything the same...even the cake and gift tables.
I thought it was weird for a potential family reunion but what ever.
The day of the event comes and the bride has asked me not to put it on the Daily Events sheet that is posted through out the hotel.
She asks that our staff let guests know what room the event is in when they ask. I comply.
The event starts. No family reunion.
Its still a wedding.
The guests have been told no different, there was never a family reunion in the works. They are there for the Smith/Reeves wedding.

This is when I get called to the ballroom from my office....at this point the Banquets manager is handing everything.
The Banquet Manager has huge, crazy eyes when I get up to the room.

The bride is getting married to a DIFFERENT GUY.
The guest are realizing this as he comes out to stand at the end of the aisle to wait for his bride.
People are looking around and asking "Who's that guy??"
There is mass confusion and people crying and basic bedlam.
It was awesome.

One week later I get a call from the groom asking if anything was in the works for him to receive a partial refund on his cancelled wedding.
My assistant who was out on vacay when this all went down took the call.
She told him no, we don't refund wedding that happen only ones that are canceled due to acts of God.
He was like "What the WHAT? What wedding happened???"

That was a fun conversation to have.

A guy I worked with &amp; his girlfriend staged a fake wedding, to appease her parents (who were convinced that their daughter was being taken advantage of by this much older guy) and conceal the fact that he was not yet actually divorced. Another coworker pretended to be a minister. The ceremony was held at the bosses house.

Winner. /gavel
Do you want to pick up your trophy, or have it delivered?

I just want my wedding gift back. They didn't even tell people it was fake until the last possible minute. I attended the bridal shower, they registered, etc. They played everyone. Then came up with a story that his (the grooms) wife was dragging out the divorce based on his infidelity. Obviously he would have known weeks in advance that he had no marriage license.
They kept all the gifts, explaining that they would have a REAL wedding asap.

Cinderella Disney themed wedding.

Me too! Everything from invitations, cake, favors, etc. The bride was older and the groom's very uptight Jewish family didn't like her. There were 2 ceremonies, one in a church that looked like the Taj Mahal and the other at the hotel. The dad put down her family in his speech. My boyfriend at the time and his best friend were groomsmen. My friend (now wife of friend) and I were seated with the bride's parents' neighbors who kept making comments about the groom's grandfather's blessing in Hebrew.
