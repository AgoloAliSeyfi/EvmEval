Certainly there must be a few dissidents here or there, but the majority really do believe everything they are taught. There is no reason for them not to. From birth they are conditioned and never hear an alternate version of anything. Very successful indoctrination. That indoctrination of the Juche philosophy manifests the isolation and paranoia. It's a philosophy of self reliance. One of their favorite mottos is "We have nothing to envy". They believe they are the pure race. The people think South Korea is a hell hole and that the North is a heaven.

It's not as if these people know they are being suppressed or know that it is wrong (besides those in the slave camps perhaps). Through their propaganda they wake up each morning thinking "today is when the US attacks". They delude themselves into thinking the suppression is simply "what needs to be done" in order to defend themselves.

Despite this brainwash the North Koreans as a people are extremely humble and pleasant. When I was visiting I was told at all times what to do. I could not leave my guides side. He told me who to talk to, what to eat, where to sleep, what to take photos of. However I did get to talk to quite a few people in impromptu settings. They are very curious about me and the world, but nothing will stray them from their brainwash. No no way did I try to argue with them, it would be a waste and very very rude. A few times I tried to tell them I was American (i figured out the Korean word) and some of the facial expressions were great, most didn't believe me. Thought I was British.

It was a completely bizarre but fascinating place that is very misunderstood (not to say nothing is wrong).

Here are my public photos if you are interested. I even met with a 4 star General at the DMZ! We talked and he mentioned he wanted peace with the US. haha go figure!

Isn't that the issue lisab pointed out?

It doesn't take a lot of effort to plan a tour that will only show you the rich/patriotic parts of the country.

Of course, they showed me what they wanted me to see, no doubt about that. In my mind I often "joked" about what was on the other side of that hill. However Pyongyang and the other few cities I visited are quite large and you can't stage everything.

Actually, I'd heard a while ago that they (in partnership with telecom giant Orascom) has resumed work on the Ryugyong Hotel and had at least finished the exterior cladding:

Kim Jong Il was the front man for the military dictorship that runs North Korea. He had power but others have power too. Given N.K is so secretive it difficult know anything about the place for certain so what does all this mean -who knows. Any thinking on this is pure speculation. Time will tell what will happen, the one thing we know for sure societies change when we least expect them to.

haha yeah, the label said it had 36 kinds of penis. I hope they meant 36 kinds of seal penis! It taste fine, like a funky whiskey. All my aliments were cured, so it was worth it!

The monks was from a Buddhist monastery. Go figure! I think he was the only one there, or at least the only one I saw.

Thanks, but actually as a tourist it's one of the safest places you can ever be (in terms of crime). As long as you follow an extensive rule list, ok with faking respect and having no freedom, it's not half bad! ;)

<img src="images/smilies/yuck.gif"/> not sure i could drink pickled pickles

maybe the leader worship is some kind of buddism spin, not that different from the tibetan llama in theory, if not practice.
