Hmmm - I know it is a deviation from a thread about execution - but I am nonetheless stunned by what seems to be a casual assumption that the penalty ought to be a choice between execution and prison for life.

This must be purely based on revenge, no?

I do not know as much about murderers in the USA, where murder is far more common than it is here, but I do know that here, in Australia, most murderers are out in about 10 - 12 years (I might be somewhat out of date here) - it used to be closer to 8.

Why?

Well, at least here, the "ordinary" murderer is the least likely to re-offend of criminals. Clearly, professional gang-land killers, or serial or "lust" killers are different - the average fella who kills once - without a violent history - is likely to be more like you and me than the average crim.

Women who kill are - at least here - most likely to do so after years of violence - and a number of attempts to escape said violence - not infrequently when they find the fella has abused the kids. Not all - some of them are terrifying - and I wouldna wanna meet them in a dark alley - but the majority - so far.

Or, they (male and female) are nuts. And, proving insanity is way harder here than in the USA.

(Mind you, more women are getting more violent - as are the men - I could comment at great length on that, but it is prolly irrelevant.)

So - if they are at little risk of re-offending - what do we do? (And it generally ain't that hard to tell the ones who are - PROVING it is harder...)

Prison isn't generally gonna make someone better. Very much the opposite.

Deterrence? Hmmmmmmm - my reading suggests that, with such crimes, it MAY deter if apprehension is almost certain almost all the time. Hmmmmmm...

So - revenge. Fabulous. Is no consideration to be given to the crim? Just how good a basis is revenge for sentencing? As PART of the process, fine. As all of it? Crap.

How many of you talking so easily of execution or life without parole know anything about the people who commit these crimes? About what execution or life in prison entails? Really? Some of you are statistically likely to do so - most, I suspect, are not.

I am no bleeding heart - well, I am - but it bleeds for both sides, actually.

I have known personally six people who have been murdered.

3 were clients. Killed by violent partners who had pursued and threatened them for years - who had made numerous threats to kill them. Two were killed in front of their children (and in front of a lot of other people with kids) - one was murdered WITH her children. I, in my darker moments, wanted to perform post-natal abortion upon the killers - before they did it - because it was clear they were gonna.

Know what? I understand what the guys did - and I understand the guys - because they were basically pathetic wounded babies, whose bottle had been taken away, and who could not (or believed they could not - which is sort of the point) survive without it. So, they had a huge pathetic baby's rage - with a baby's inhibitions - ie none. Why? Well, each story is different, and each sort of the same. It would be good to hear the stories, you know - good to get to understand what the world is about. I can tell some of them, if anyone wants to hear. I don't much, though - most people do not want to hear them.

Now - they ARE dangerous - cos they would move to another bottle, and it would all begin again. For this reason they probably need to stay inside - unless they really change. Know what? The odd one does. Really. Not so many - and most try to look as if they have - but some do. Seen it happen.

Now, I do not try to deny the rage I feel - (hey - I get to work with the kids - fun, that - and go to the funerals) - but the rage is, in my view, atavistic bullshit - at least when it comes to decision making.

There is a great educational program here, where ordinary folk get pulled in, and made part of a huge jury.

They first get access to what the media is saying about the case - (usually a serious crime of a few years back) - bear in mind, most cases here ar enot fought out in the media - and reporting is VERY restrained compared with the USA. The defence says virtually nothing.

The "jury" votes on a penalty - generally VERY harsh.

Then, they hear the prosecution case - vote again - less harsh sentence.

Then they hear the defence - plus get an education about the principles of sentencing.

MUCH less harsh sentences. To know all.......? Well, no - nor should it be that way - but..........

Anyway - I am intruding on a thread which has become - as far as I have read - a logic duel - but I thought I would introduce a little local flora and fauna.

I have a lot more to say, if people are interested..... but I need to go to bed now...it is way late. And I have only just begun to discuss murderers....I have known a lot of them.
