I think you need to read it again. <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/wink.gif"/>

I'd like to hear the conversation between the OP and the judge in a year's time when the OP tries to justify illegally claiming a benefit that he isn't entitled to.

if he can prove that he has maintained a home for her (not his fault she chooses not to live in it) and given the CB to her to spend on her self then he can carry on claiming CB for her, it only becomes an issue if someone else tries to claim it and or get parental responsibility.

I know someone in exactly the same position as the OP and it has been confirmed by both the DWP and a solicitor that while she's in full time education the claim is valid.

No, me too. It was the getting given a Porsche Cayenne at 17 that made me wonder. If he does exist and his folks do run a Porsche dealership and they really offered him a Porsche, despite the astronomical insurance, if you can even get it for a 17 yr old, wouldn't he choose something a bit cooler than a Cayenne? It's a rich mummy's school run car.

Apologies to OP if it's not a wind up.

I would imagine the insurance would be on the dealership block policy as he works there and all tax deductible anyway( btw he is 18.)

Hi All,
I've been reading these forums for a long time, but this is my first post, and I hope someone can help!

My daughter turned 16 a couple of weeks ago, and although we have always had a healthy and happy relationship previously, we had a huge row because she wanted to go out to celebrate her birthday on a school night and I wouldn't allow it.
Following this row she became very quiet and withdrawn, until last week when I returned home from work to find a letter telling me that she had moved out and would contact me in a day or so.
She contacted me on Saturday, and told me that her boyfriend (just turned 18) had rented and furnished a flat for her, and that she wishes to live there and does not want to fall out with me, but would prefer minimal contact for the forseeable future.
Today I received a telephone call from a solicitor acting on behalf of my daughter and her boyfriend, - the call was to establish whether I would be prepared to transfer legal responsibility for my daughter to a third party, or whether I would contest this, and also if I would be prepared to transfer child benefit payments to a third party. I told the solicitor that this had all come as something of a shock to me and that I would contact him in due course to discuss.
The problem is that I feel my daughter is quite immature, though is very bright and doing extremely well at school, and this seems completely out of character for her. Can anyone tell me what my rights are?

You say you like the boyfriend, have you met his parents? could you call them and arrange to met to have a chat about this? your daughter is young relationships at that age can change like the wind, if it doesn't work out and he's funding all this where will she stand? she'll be coming home won't she.

I'd chat to his parents then arrange to meet your daughter and talk to her also. I feel for you because I'd also be worried sick, were parents it's our jobs to worry.
