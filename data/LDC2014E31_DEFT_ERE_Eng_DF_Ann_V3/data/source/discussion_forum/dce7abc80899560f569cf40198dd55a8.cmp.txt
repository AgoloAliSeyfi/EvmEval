Yeah, not saying it couldn't or didn't happen, it's just one more aspect that doesn't add up. You'd think it would be a given that you and your friend would be sharing a stand together. That's why you're there...to hang with your friend. To leave it up to a random drawing makes little sense. But again, doesn't mean it didn't happen.

Sounds like the adults were idiots

To add, his "attack" sounds similar to an epileptic seizure. It's interesting to note that the attack happened before he ever saw the creature. Those suffering epileptic seizures have been known to hallucinate as a result. <a href="http://www.epilepsy.com/story/978597">Here's one claim.</a> Also, hunger, stress, etc have been known to cause such seizures. He said he hadn't eaten, I'd say it was probably a little stressful being stuck in unfamiliar territory, etc. Not a doctor though, just throwing it out there. A friend used to see angels during his seizures.

All the more reason to be respectful to John, listen carefully, and not treat him with ire or disrepsect. You make good points as you always do but if you jump to fast to think he's just straight lying, John will never listen.

This is a quick little OT but I'm I couldn't help when you mentioned epilepsy. My avatar is of Ian Curtis, the lead singer of the post-punk Manchester band Joy Division that went on to become New Order. Ian was epileptic and often had seizures (sometimes on stage) and weakened from the condition he hanged himself in his kitchen just before he was to go on his first North American tour. He was a brilliant mind in music who still inspires many musicians like me.

So in cos' diagram I guess it kinda looks like the wee little human in blue is trying to hide Bigfoot's monster wang.

I hadn't noticed that. In my efforts to avoid copyright infringement it seems I inadvertently produced bigfoot pornography. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/mazeguyemotions/eye-popping.gif"/>

Sweaty, it's the trashy name-calling of KKZ and JREF that is disrespectful to John.

Maybe Sweaty doesnt like not being the center of attention. JC is trying to share his story and maybe Sweaty can go do more on the inconclusive Memorial Day stuff.

"Trashy"?

How about this, from The Great and Powerful Kaze, to wvbig...

The Great Kaaz sees fit to judge everybody's ability to think.....yet when wolftrax posted his bogus, custom-altered doll-hand illusion gif, which has no relevance to anything...kitakaze instantly praised it....without question, or critical thought.

Old Thunder-Cheeks stands on his *-*-*-*- throne, and babbles-on, insulting every single Bigfoot proponent's ability to think objectively.

He thinks of himself as the 'Uncrowned King of Thunderdome'... <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/cool.gif"/>.......but I see him more as the 'Uncrowned Janitor of Tinkledome'... <a href="http://i172.photobucket.com/albums/w28/SweatyYeti/Pee1.jpg">http://i172.photobucket.com/albums/w...yYeti/Pee1.jpg</a>
