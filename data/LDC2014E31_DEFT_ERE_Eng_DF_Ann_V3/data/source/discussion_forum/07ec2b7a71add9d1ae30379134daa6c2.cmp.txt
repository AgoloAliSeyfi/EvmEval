They killed another Christian in Egypt today. How many think it would be cool for us to fly airplanes into the pyraminds and erect a big Christian Church on the site? Raise your hand!

Egypt was responsible for 9-11?

Hot damn! We invaded the wrong country.

Or when you say "they" do you mean "them" as in: "I lump them all together."

Who are the US Imans doing the same?

Cool. Using that logic, if some Christian goes postal in some small town in America, we'll demolish the church....

Impossible. Christianity has never been responsible for any atrocities throughout the history of mankind.

So now you're comparing one of the eight wonders of the world with the twin towers? More worryingly, you are comparing a 3rd world shithole's morals/mores/norms with that of the USA. How does that feel?

The site of the WTC is hallowed ground, just like where the USS Arizona sunk. There are remains of Americans brutally killed in both of those places.

It deserves the same reverence, decency, and respect.

No 100 percent sure, but I think you'll find the mosque isn't being built on ground zero, but nearby....

You're a MORON. I asked you a question. Would it be cool for us to fly airplanes into the pyramids and then build us a Christian church there? Simple yes or no.. can you handle it?

You know, when bodies get mixed up at Arlington, the military haters are out in force with all of their "respect for the dead" lip service.

When you ask them for a little decency and respect in a place where human tissue was flying out of destroyed aircraft on the buildings below as far as far as jet parts, they can't deal with that.

Bearing in mind Saudi Arabia is probably about as far away as you would want any mosque that wanted to be built in the US, what is a 'respectful' distance?

You logic is flawed twice over.

Are you trying to make a point about a country, when no country was directly responsible for 9-11.

Or are you trying to make a point about Islam by offering to desecrate shrines to a religion that has absolutely nothing to do with Islam?

The proposed site is about as far away from "ground zero" as the Mosque that now is already there.
