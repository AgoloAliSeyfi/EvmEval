The only time I ever made it to Vancouver, we came up to buy some seeds. Goooooood stuff.... <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/> I was really surprised how professional and not seedy (hah <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/> ) the whole process was. I was expecting to meet some dirty guy in shades in an alley somewhere, and that wasn't the case at all. I love Vancouver...it's so clean!

Right now, I'm mostly for legalizing because the medical marijuana crap just isn't working, and that pisses me off. Right now my dad is off in Montana. He's a "care provider" for "patients" that have medical problems that can't be cured other ways supposedly. All this winds up being is my stoned ass dad, sitting around selling weed semi-legally to a bunch of people with ridiculous health complaints (I have a sore knee! I can't function!) The abuse of the medical marijuana laws in Montana are really starting to upset a lot of people. One "clinic" in Billings was firebombed a while back. It's all such a giant joke.

So the solution: Legalize it for everyone, so we can all stop pretending that we have ulcers and crap, use the tax to fix the world, and lets all get on with it. Who cares about weed really? What's the big deal? Has anyone ever really heard of a guy going out and smoking too much, and then going home to beat his wife? Or breaking into someones house and stealing their stereo for more weed money? Doesn't happen. I would rather be on the highway next to a person who is blazed out of their skull than someone who had one too many at the bar.

Now then. I used to smoke. A lot. Too much. I'm going to get into trouble here-- I've been high around my kids. I didn't smoke around them, but I was high when I came home. A lot of times, I'm just stressed out and annoyed by my kids. I want to rush them off into bed just to get some peace and quiet. But when I've smoked a little, I'm a great mom. I'm happy to sit down and play silly games with them. I don't yell. I can find ways to explain their endless silly questions and it doesn't get on my nerves. I can see them for the beautiful little miracles that they really are.

I guess I'm just mentioning this, because smoking weed doesn't necessarily make you a "bad mom". Sometimes it can help you be better.

These days, I don't seek it out. I don't have a problem if I'm out with friends at the bar, or at a concert and it finds me. But I know my limits, and if I had it around all the time, it goes badly for me. I keep a healthy distance, I guess.

Babies start in an "oven" so maybe they thought it was a good idea to put it back..... <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

I'm for it. My mom came to visit during my wedding. She smokes 24/7. I was scared to death my neighbors would call the police. I yelled at her everytime she said "pot" out loud. I also almost had a heart attack when she decided to light a joint in the car in the middle of my town in front of everyone.

Haha I'm super paranoid, I'd rather it just be legal. I think it is a silly crime.

i think i posted that one. i think it was shitty parenting- not the weed at fault.
it still has to be used with some responsibility- just like any mind altering drug.

like fpf said- one hit would make me silly and play with my kid more. getting stoned out of my mind would have to happen when James is sleeping over my mother in laws house for the night.

Umm what is the Marshmallow game?!

That game where kids have a contest to see who can stuff the most marshmallows in their mouth at once. A lot of kids have died from choking and not being able to spit it out because their mouths are full of marshmallows. <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/mad.gif"/>

Also, I'm really surprised that so many people agree with me!
