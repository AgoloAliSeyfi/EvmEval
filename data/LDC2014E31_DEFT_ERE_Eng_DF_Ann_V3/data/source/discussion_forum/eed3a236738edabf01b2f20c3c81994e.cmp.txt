Women should not be made to feel bad for having been raped.

</quote>

Yeah. I remember reading about a 15 year old girl who had been raped, and her mother "couldn't look at her" because she was "ashamed" of her. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/lolwut.gif" alt=":lolwut:"/> These people are just going about their business, not asking to be raped. It's not the victim's fault.

Herpaderp - but we do tackle rape, HENCE why it is against the law! God forbid people take responsibility for their own safety! <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/eek.gif" alt=":eek:"/>

The awkward moment when you realise downloading music from file sharing sties is against the law and the bare minimum is done to stop it. Just because its against the law doesn't mean an issue is being tackled.

Logic fail.

Well stay on the phone then during the journey, and if they seem dodgy take their license number, and don't go into an unregistered taxi, wait for one that is by a proper taxi company? Not exactly difficult.

</quote>

Oh yea. So pay for the taxi and a phone call home as well.

Also, make sure you carry round a pen and pad of paper, so that you can take licence number down after your in the cab and you decided they are dodgy.

Obviously, you cannot forget that you need to make sure that it is a "proper taxi company" as well because that could never be faked.

I suggest that we should also bring a camera in the bag to photograph the taxi driver.

Oh thank Lord, someone talking sense. Why are we telling women not to get raped instead of telling men not to rape?

It's not like getting a taxi is even something everyone can do. You can't always afford a taxi (especially if you're in London!), you can't always flag one down, you might not have a working phone on you (lack of credit, lack of battery) and you might have a phone but no idea of local taxi numbers. Does this mean you deserve to be raped? Obviously not.

The point here should be 'if you see a woman walking alone at night, don't rape her' as opposed to 'if you're a woman, or have any chance of being perceived as one, don't walk around alone at night'.

Tbh no one said that not having all those things means you deserve to be raped, so stop being so dramatic.

Is Eamonn Holmes an egghead internally as well as externally or something? Does he not think that the agony of hindsight with regards to getting a taxi hasn't preyed on this poor woman's mind since the attack happened? What is the point in telling her what she obviously knows, the dumb insensitive fool.

Why should we have to take a taxi? Yes it's safer, we know that (well apart from unlicensed taxi drivers). However shouldn't we have the freedom to choose whether or not we can take a taxi, without the fear of being raped? The rapists should be stopped, not the woman for choosing the route she wants to go home by.

If only we could station a police officer in every single dark area of the entire country. In fact, lets do it. Let's make 1/4 of our population a police officer.

I'm sorry but this isn't always the case. Up until last year, I would walk anywhere on my own in the dark and it wouldn't bother me. I know it's the same old "I didn't think it would happen to me" but no-one does. I work at my local pub and used to walk home by myself at midnight and it would only take 5 minutes. Last year, although I wasn't raped, I was attacked on my way home from work, on my own street, at 10.30 at night. Women are now being criticised for not taking taxis home but where do you draw the line? Should I have been getting a taxi for that 5 minute walk four times a week?

Don't be so obtuse, everyone has a mobile nowadays, with the capability of taking notes, and I meant tell the person on the phone. Also they have to have their licence on display, open the door, say hi, make sure you can see they have a license, and that it looks legit, or even better phone one from a proper company, and also most phones have cameras nowadays <img src="images/smilies/wink.png"/>

Anything else you want to pick at? It is all quite reasonable.
