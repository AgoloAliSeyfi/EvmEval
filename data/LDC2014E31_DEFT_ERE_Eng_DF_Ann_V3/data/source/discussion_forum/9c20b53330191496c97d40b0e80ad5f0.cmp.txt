Everywhere has oil in some quantity, i'd bet, i think their argument stands; libya- has lots of oil n.korea - not a renowned oil exporter really is it ?

North Korea has horrible, horrible resources. It has mediocre levels of coal and get's energy by nuclear power. It's largely mountainous to the east and north and has tundra plains in the north. There are some rice fields but soil and weather isn't great so famine is not uncommon.

N.Korea isn't worth the effort to sack even without Nukes.

Every foreign company has had to evacuate their staff from Libya. Every day that they cannot work on an oil field the companies lose big money.

If the rebels do not win then Gadaffi is hardly going to welcome these people back in is he? Gadaffi has already said he does not trust western firms, and that oil contracts will only go to Russia China India. Gadaffi may ell hold onto Libya and if he does the Western will have absolutely no benefit from this intervention. And any benefit if he steps down remains to be seen

</quote>

In the short term, yes. I seriously doubt that Gaddafi's going to stay in power, all this would have been for nothing. I just reckon they'll replace him with a more cooperative Gaddafi.

The Tamil Tigers were bombing, raping terrorist Marxists, they got exactly what they deserved.

Stalin... meh.

Mao ZeDong can't be called evil. The Chinese Famine was inevitable, they a die hard communist he served it for the military and primary industry workers. If that happened in elsewhere the country would have went into anarchy and the people would have died regardless.

The USA did eventually intervene in Cambodia in the late 60s... but by then there was no one else who could read.

Idi Amin... okay, so he's a douchebag.

Intervention exists only when it serves the intervener interests. If there's no benefit there's no point - people die, shoop da whoop.

Aswell as being responsible for the death of some 800,000 during the counter-revolutionary campaign. He has been cited for saying that he would sacrifice a third of his country in a nuclear war, in order that capitalism would fall.

Also, in response to an earlier post ' NK is despotic, but not a tyranny'. That's a completely fatuous comment. The two are more or less synonymous. Both indicate an authoritarian government which exercises cruel and ruthless control over their citizens. Can hardly deny that Kim Jong is not cruel when he has active concentration camps slaughtering dissidents.

Because we can't. Even if they didn't have nukes we don't have the military capacity to be able to fight North Korea, in North Korea.

To say that we have not intervened in NK because they have very little oil is an idiotic and ignorant argument

</quote>

Not necessarily.

To argue that this is the only reason for which we have not intervened in the DPRK is a somewhat improbable argument,

but to deny, as you seem to be doing, that oil wealth is indeed at times a factor in interventionist western policies, for example libya, is even more ignorant.

I think the argument very much stands - albeit weakly.

Its a stupid argument with regards to NK end off. Even Libya is a bloody weak argument to make that at the moment has absolutely no basis at all. Facts as they are show that the intervention has done more damage to western oil interests in the area. As I have said it were it about oil the West would not have done anything in Libya.

North Korea is as bad, no, i meant WORSE than Nazi Germany.

Aside from the lack of free speech, capitalism and being made to worship the leader, the country has an awfull amount of cruelty.

If an individual complains about his way of life, inadvertently says something bad about Kim Jong, or the country, then he, his children and his parents are all taken away to a concentration camp.

<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/04/north-korea-political-prisoners-amnesty">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011...soners-amnesty</a>

Amnesty estimates there to be 200,000 prisoners held in concentration camps for offences like these, there the men, women, children are held indefinetly.

Poison gas has been used on inmates, with this shocking report from a defector of him witnessing a new nerve gas being tested on a family whilst scientists observe from above. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/feb/01/northkorea">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/feb/01/northkorea</a>

Public executions are also done regularly, and barbed wire fences, land mines and anti-aircraft defences guard the compounds, as this report shows <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3071466/ns/us_news-only_on_msnbccom/t/death-terror-n-korea-gulag/">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3071466/...n-korea-gulag/</a>

This video from an escapee talks about the 10 metre trenches outside the prison camp, with metal spikes to impale anyone who jumps <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=6e3_1226613958">http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=6e3_1226613958</a>

So why did we interven in Nazi Germany in 1939, and in Iraq 2002, but not in North Korea 2011?
