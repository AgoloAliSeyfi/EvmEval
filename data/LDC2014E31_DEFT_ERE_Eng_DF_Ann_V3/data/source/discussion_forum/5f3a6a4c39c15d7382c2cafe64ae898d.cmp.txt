Fast forward several years, and now not only do I STILL not get the respect of the people who make $250k+/yr. but people born with a golden spoon in their mouths, who contribute NOTHING to society, that get high-paying jobs because of connections by their parents, NOTHING to do with what they know get more respect than somebody like me who worked himself so far to the bone that I am now suffering from chronic stomach problems and ulcers, for possibly the rest of my life because of the overstress that I have to deal with.

That relatively ubiquitous sense of snobbery by the rich, as well as (more importantly) they're not technically working significantly harder than any other members of society (and the poorest members often work harder, given their execrable jobs), is why I'm very happy with progressive taxation.

I was told that back in 1999, programmers/engineers were being paid on average roughly twice what the average programmer/engineer is being paid now. Not to mention their hours were easier. I know somebody working as a web developer in a small company for $14/hr. It's sad when you see that and apparently so many have seen it, that the college of business at my University has been seeing a huge spike in their attendance increase because "That's the only way you can make something of yourself nowadays". The six-figure dream starts there and ends there now. Everyone else has taken too much of a dip.

It's the dot com bust. People took their money out of that and went into real estate. Then the government screwed around with that.

Examples: Teaching you could get to $100k/yr in NV... used to, if you had experience since the Jurassic era and had a Master's or Doctorate. I heard with the exception of CA, AK, HI and NY, it's still like this in the other 46 states. Now I dunno many teachers who make more than $75-80k/yr. from my old high school due to ed cuts.

But they get a lot of time off, too. One of my friends is a teacher, and she takes a lot of trips.

So if you've seen why my tirades have gone so much against conservatives during my time here last year, that's why. The $250,000 mark is roughly 1.5%. I know Savage belongs to this elite 1.5%, but I do not. I had said in another board that I would make a vow to consistently get to the $250k mark before I died, even if it killed me, so that they have no purpose to call me "lazy" or "entitled".

I don't direct those tirades at CFers, or CFers in the Tea Party. I direct them at Tea Partiers I know who are like this and talk show hosts/politicians who subscribe to this way of thinking since my chances of actually saying it to their face are near zero. So I just hope Savage or Limbaugh slips into CF one day, finds my tirade, and then goes bananas over it.

Rush has a bit of an ego. So does Hannity. Sometimes I listen because they're less annoying that the stupid Canadian radio stations that drive me up the wall.

I live in a 1-bedroom apartment. The other complaint I heard from my parents and other peers from the TP are why don't I get a house. Simple. I don't feel like getting one right now. The market isn't going to go up for at least 3-4 years for houses I feel. And I want to wait until I can move my g/f to Vegas from Minnesota before we do anything like that.

Yeah, it makes sense in your situation. I live in a three bedroom house. It's small, but for me, it makes more sense than renting because I've got a steady job where I'll likely be employed for a while. I got my house from a guy who used to be a stock broker, then retired from that and started a non-profit to build affordable houses. I was making $33k/yr at that time. He advised me to buy a house because he thinks that inflation is going to start hitting. I've got a fixed rate mortgage that got bought by Bank of America (gag) so hopefully I'm set.

I LOVE Jerry Doyle. The comparison between him and the other 3 guys on the KDWN regular lineup (Levin, Savage, Beck) are AMAZING. I have recommended him to even liberals who just want a different outlook. He has such an intellectual explanation of everything and I am SO glad that he is a local. I'd love to meet him and shake his hand for at least TRYING to give an explanation for many of the outlandish remarks, and at many points refuting the more extreme views of the TP.

If you get a chance, you should listen to Dennis Praeger. When I worked security to put myself through college, I got a chance to listen to his show and I really liked it. If you have a sarcastic sense of humor you should listen to Suits.

Thanks Panzer. This was why I felt like leaving CF for a while. I felt like it was getting too personal with me and other people, and I have conservative friends on here I do respect and wish I could get to know. A lot of people here seem extremely nice and maybe if we had talked about lighter stuff more and a lot of this stuff less, we wouldn't have so many issues with "Liberals are blah blah blah" or "Conservatives are blah blah blah."

I like the no A/C idea though.
