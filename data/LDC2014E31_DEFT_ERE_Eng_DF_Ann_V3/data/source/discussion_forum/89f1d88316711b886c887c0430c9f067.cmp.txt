"ur url" is <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:IrjNg2IOatwC:www.homebeer.com.tw/images/">http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:IrjNg2IOatwC:www.homebeer.com.tw/images/</a> which I got by right clicking on the image, left clicking on properties and copying the Address: (URL). Make sure you get all the URL, some of it maybe hidden, I usually copy left to right, top to bottom to insure I get all. Most pics end with.gif or.jpg. Good Luck <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"/> <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation"/>

So, it is like this (without the two blanks):

If I take out those two blanks, this happens:

During my last year in the Navy I became enamored of some right wing thinkers (temporary stupidity). I left the service intending to enlist in the army and volunteer to fight in 'Nam. But I read a newspaper article shortly after that and was apauled at descriptions of our side stringing captured Viet Cong together by running barbed wire through their cheeks. In the same article I read of Viet Kong prisoners being thrown out of helicopters instead of taken to POW camps. I said, "This is not what America is about." I began researching the roots of the war (and our involvement in other parts of the world in general). I concluded that we were the aggressors. It was not long before I began to join protests. I have been protesting that war since 1965 and will continue to do so the rest of my life.

Unfortunately, that is what war is edgar, and one of the reasons I am against it. War can take a perfectly normal person and turn them into a right winger, terrible, isn't it.

BTW, there usually is a purpose for actions, someone said in another thread that good interegators can get prisoners to talk. From what I understand, they would take two prisoners up, start asking questions and when they would talk - they threw one out. The other talked in a hurry.

Short story:

I was in the 1st Cav and we were on what I called the "trail from hell". We had been getting into action two or three times a day for about a week. One day after a couple of Chu Hoi's were giving up and walking towards us - at the last moment they dropped their rifles and started shooting. Needless to say, we had about 10 rifles and a machine gun trained and them - enough said.

A couple of buddies decided they want to impale them with sticks through a 1st Cav patch. I stopped them and said -

1) That's totally inhumane.
2) The only thing you will do is inflame their buddies when they are found and we will then have enraged enemies.
3) You can't punched a stick through a patch, a shirt and into someones chest.

He looks passed me at another buddy and says, "Can you help me here!"

Go figure!

A guy who grew up with my younger brothers came home from the war. He began telling me stories of his activities over there. He told of his personal collection of Vietnamese girls' nipples. Every time he got the chance he cut them off and saved them. He told of killing everyone in a village and how one very old man pleaded "Me no Kong. Me no Kong." He told how each of his buddies and he in turn put a bullet in him as they passed.
I am not naive enough to think atrocities were carried on by only one side. I have read of how ingenius the Vietnamese were with their traps and putting bombs on little children and the like. But if we hadn't been there such activities would have ended all the sooner.

More so than that, why were we there - for Kissinger's Domino Theory. If you remember, VietNam saved Cambodia then turn the country back over to them after restoring order. So goes the Domino Theory. Fortunately, I don't have a one horror story just as that one. The things I witnessed were bad enough, plus I would have never participated in them, I would have protested! That's what we have in common.

WASHINGTON -- Former Senate majority leader George Mitchell, selected by Democrats to help lead an independent commission that will investigate last year's terrorist attacks, withdrew Wednesday. He cited two factors: time and money.

Kissinger is news, thanks. Lee Hamilton to replace Mitchell. Was Hamilton the one who closed the doors on Iran Contra behind closed doors without a report on what actually happened?
