The cold war is over, amazing how many people still get a feeling of security from having the ability to sterilize the biosphere. Keep enough to merely destroy mankind and shitcan the rest.

To make this simple for the simpletons here.

Let's say you are the LAPD Chief and you have Russia and Chinese gangs threatening the city with automatic weapons you know the ones "libs" freak out about. Well, being the genius lib you are....you propose getting rid of 80% of your police force's automatic weapons and leaving them with pee shooter handguns to take on the gangs in addition to the North Korean gangs and new Iranian gangs trying to get automatic weapons.

Well, what you end up with is the bank shootout in North Hollywood years ago where 2 gunmen with automatic weapons shot up the place until the police went to gun stores and took high powered rifles to kill the gunmen.

FYI....there is no nuclear arms "gun store" for the US to run to in a shooting battle with China, Russia, North Korea, etc....

As long as we can all go to bed at night knowing that we can destroy all of humanity 30 or 40 times over, that's all I care about.

Shut the fuck up, idiot.

SLBMs are not replacing ICBMs, we still have 3 missile wings located in WY,ND and MT. SLBMs serve a different purpose than ICBMs in our overall scheme which you don't have a clue about, cleatus.

The rest of your ALCMs and SIOP rundown is..... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

Dumbass....the ICBM force is pretty cost efficient. The weapons last for decades and require minimum maintenance compared to tanks, ships and airplanes.

They are the biggest bang for the buck and have kept your sorry ass protected ever since you started sucking O2.

If we knew the price tag on this hideously expensive weapons system we will never use I think most of us wouldn't mind cutting them down in number.

ICBM's are being replaced by SLBM's. Cruise missiles are the best course. The launch of an ICBM would be immediately detected. And weapons launched from the former Soviet Union would hit the US FIRST even if launched a short time LATER. (ROTATION OF THE EARTH). We need marine based SLBM's and cruise missiles, NOT ICBM's.
*********************************************
"Additionally, ICBMs are generally considered to be nuclear only; although several conceptual designs of conventionally-armed missiles have been considered, the launch of such a weapon would be such a threat that it would demand a nuclear response, eliminating any military value to such a weapon."
*********************************************
Any general in the US who says NUTS to reducing ICBM's needs to RETIRE or be in a mental health facility.

No source for the comment by Gen. Kehler who was appointed to head STRATCOM BY Obama. It would be very unusual for him to make such a remark as he has long been an advocate of SLBM &amp; CRUISE systems.

It probably wasn't said. Anyone who thinks the US relies on ICBM's would not understand our nuclear arsenal at any rate.

Let me give you a hint, his background is with ICBMs....but of course he wants to get rid of them because you told him so. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

So how many do we have and how many do we really need? We will never use them again in a first strike situation so what is their mission? Simply a pawn in some balance of terror? Decommission the bulk of them and store the cores, got to be cheaper than keeping the overwhelming number we have on the ready.
