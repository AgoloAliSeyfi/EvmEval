Actually if you read the decision the Snyders were awarded $2.9 million (reduced to $2.1million) not because of the newspaper coverage, but because Mr. Snyder sought out and watched the WBC's "documentary" video of the protest on their website. True story. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/thup.gif"/>

The 4th Circuit used Milkovich as their primary case with Cantwell quoted as the secondary.

But what they actually overturned the District on was sending the question of law as to whether the speech should have First Amendment protection to the jury rather than deciding it from the bench - which is what they did by focusing on type of speech rather than nature of speaker and audience and concluded it was protected. The only problem may be that they used New York Times in their tort analysis after saying public v. private didn't matter.

The concurrence at the Circuit level also raises the (valid, IMO) point of lack of sufficient evidence to prove harm but on an amicus waiver, over which there seems to be some confusion. That's an interesting side issue that may be addressed.

Cool stuff. Here's the 4th Circuit decision if you haven't read it. It's a pdf but you don't need PACER access:

Excellent.
The court must take into consideration the technology of the times in their ruling. I just had a case where a youth committed suicide and the bullies posted more negative crap about this kid on the web site dedicated to a memorial for the youth. The parents of the youth would go on the web site to see all the kind remarks about their child and then see the negative crap also.

Usually free speech cases like these take a long time to rule on and do not have split decisions.

The problem I have here is that the WBC's site isn't a memorial site for Matthew Snyder, it is their own property to disseminate their point of view. By the time Mr. Snyder did his google search he knew from media sources WBC had been present, but he chose voluntarily to view it anyway.

IIED is a very narrow and hard to win tort for a reason, you don't want to open the door to multi million dollar judgments for anyone who says something that hurts a person's feelings, whether directed at them or not, whether made in their presence or not, whether intent to harm that individual is real or whether it is a promotional piece for their movement and the intent to harm is simply imputed because the offended party went out of his way to find it.

If this were any group other than WBC, would you feel the same way? Think about that, because whatever ruling comes down will affect all religious, quasi-political and groups out there as far as whether they can picket, protest, or use any material on their website or in their publications naming groups or individuals or that could be considered offensive to named groups or individuals.

It's the voluntary and knowing nature of Mr. Snyder's exposure that bugs me. I just don't feel comfortable with expanding IIED that far, WBC assholes or no.

Well said but I trust the jury verdict. They are the voice and interpreters of this tort and did their duty. This is about a family and their grief first and religion, or lack of it as WBC clearly shows, plays no part in it for me.

Calling for people to commit crimes against a group is hate speech.

Basically it's a kind of incitment to riot and it ought to be illegal.

There has to be a present risk of harm, editec. Reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on first amendment rights are constitutional, but only if they pass muster on this point.
