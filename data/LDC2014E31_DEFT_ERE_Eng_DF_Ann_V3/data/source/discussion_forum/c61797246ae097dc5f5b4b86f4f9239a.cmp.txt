I ran this thread before but if you have never posted in it, I'd like your opinion.

Michael Vick was a star quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL). He got convicted of running a dog-fighting ring and spent nearly 2 years in jail. When he got out he was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles - of which I am a fan. He is having a fantastic season this year. He was responsible for making one of the greatest comebacks in the history of the NFL last Sunday against New York. My question is simple.

Could you root for a convicted dog-killer?

No. I'm sorry, but when one is willing to abuse animals with the utter lack of compassion and concern for their innate innocence as he demonstrated, no - I'm not going to "root" for his success on the gridiron - or the team that hired him for that matter.

So I take it, that you don't believe in redemption or overcoming past mistakes right? How very Christian of you. <img src="http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/doh.gif"/>
