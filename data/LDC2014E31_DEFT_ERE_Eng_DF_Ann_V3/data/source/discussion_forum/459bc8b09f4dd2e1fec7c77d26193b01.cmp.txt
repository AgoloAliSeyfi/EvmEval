And right there is the whole problem I have with those who argue in favor of America's policies towards Saddam. The priority of his transgressions is determined not by net human suffering caused by him, but rather by whether supporting him benefits the U.S. or not.

Personally, I'd argue that by far and away one of his "main transgressions" was the attempted genocide of Kurds, and the use of banned chemical weapons in doing so. But you see, those Kurds made the silly mistake of not being American citizens...so their attempted genocide is a "minor transgression" which can easily be swept aside.

The issue is not one of priority but in the timeline of how events unfolded. Saddams' chemical attacks and genocide against the Kurds happened just before the end of the Iran-Iraq war. US support for Iraq quickly dried out afterwards, and left Iraq alienated from their key ally. You were told so before. Unless you'll claim that the US would have to foresee this years before the events took place you will need to address this issue.

As to the relevance to this particular debate, it isn't the specific action, but rather the mentality behind it. If one argues that "the end justifies the means", and that supporting Saddam was justifiable because of some distorted idea of a "greater good", then other governments have exactly the same prerogative to engage in abuses and atrocities, so long as they believe that it brings about some kind of "net benefit", otherwise known as the "It may be bad, but if we hadn't done it, it would have been worse" argument.

How about this - the ends sometimes justify the means. In the case of Iran-Iraq war, supporting Saddam prevented a rise of a fanatical muslim power bent on domination in a critical region of the world. In the case of Tiannmen square, the massacre prevented... what exactly? Political reform that would end in somewhat lower economic growth for the next decade or two?

The discrepancy is so huge I can easily say that the ends justify the means in one case and do not in the other without applying any double standards.

Thus...if it is okay for the U.S. to support despotic regimes because it benefits American interests, then it is likewise okay for China to support despotic regimes because it benefits Chinese interests. And if it is wrong for China to do it, then it is wrong for America to do it.

Of course it is, but when viewed in the proper context, it is quickly evident that US support for Iraq is radically different from anything China is doing. Point out US support for Pinochet or Franco or South Vietnam if you will, those actually have significant resemblance to what China is doing.

I'm not taking sides. I'm standing resolutely in the middle, saying that both sides are wrong -- and that confuses the hell out of those who see the world in black-and-white.

I can sympathize with that, but you picked an entirely wrong example.

So your argument is what...that Chinese censor their newspapers, so America should do the same? That it's wrong for a newspaper to have an opinion piece that expresses opinions contrary to your own?

An idiotic argument on the face of it.

</quote>
But I didn't make that argument!

<quote orig_author="Wolfman">
So...you'll close your eyes, plug your ears, and go "nanananana...I'm not listening to you!" Again, an idiotic argument.

Strawmanning, are we?

<quote orig_author="Wolfman">
Regardless of your personal opinion of it, this is a perspective shared by a significant number of people in the world...and understanding it is far, far superior to saying, "I don't like it, so it is wrong to express it".

Except that I didn't say so.

Congrats...idiotic argument number three! Since nowhere did I say that you are expected to agree with the article, or believe that the Chinese gov't is 'better'. The only issue here is that the New York Times, and any other newspaper, not only has a right to print such things (and not face the same kind of censorship that is practiced in China), but that printing such articles is good specifically because it expresses a view that while not mainstream in the U.S., is a dominant view in China.

And understanding how other people think is the first step towards improving communication and relationships...as opposed to...oh...I don't know...simply declaring that anyone who says anything you disagree with should be silenced, or has no legitimate right to express their views.

I had two major points with my post. One to cast light on that such articles are not permitted to be printed in China, but in the US, and perhaps some conclusions can be drawn from that. Second, to reject the notion that the options are either Chinese government or American government, and particularly the US is not the only democracy, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index">not even the most democratic country</a>. Both of which you completely missed (or at least didn't bother to address).
