My little girl - age 6 - is being picked on by a boy in her class. I can see from her body language that she is scared of him, everytime he sees her he shouts things at her.
Nothing much, just childish stuff, but it is constant. Before christmas he tried to push her down a large flight of stone steps twice, he has punched her on more than one occassion. She wears a spinal brace and he punches it so while it doesnt really hurt her i would prefer him not to <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/angry-smiley-030.gif"/>

I know i'm not the only parent who has an issue with him, other parents have asked that there children be moved from sitting beside him. At one point he was at a desk on his own, but now he sits beside my daughter.

I spoke to the class teacher and she was very understanding as she knows there are problems with him. I wanted to speak to the head on the teachers recommendation but he was really busy. The school is having an inspection next week so the head will be too busy to speak to me next week apparently which i'm not very happy about.
I really want this sorted and not sure what else i can do.
Any suggestions on how to handle this greatly appreciated <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/angel-smiley-002.gif"/>

Actually next week might be the ideal week, from your daughter's point of view, for the subject to be brought up........

hun, I wouldnt have said 'nothing much just childish stuff' in relation to this. this is in my opinion really bad bullying!!! and the child is well known as a bully and you have spoken about this to the class teacher and they wont move this boy from this vulnerable little girl?
mountainofdebt is right - now is exactly the right time! or would you prefer to wait until your little girl is actually pushed down the steps?
you need to take action and you need to take it NOW!
your childs safety and wellbeing is being ignored by the school and I wouldnt care how busy the head is - his first priority has to be the children in his care!!!
I would be at the school in the morning - minus child and informing the head that until something is done about my childs safety I will not be bringing her back and that i would be informing everyone from the school governors to the LEA of this and the reasons why by letter. THEN I would probably calm down and listen. and unless i was satisfied that my child was no longer at risk of harm i would follow through on my threat.
