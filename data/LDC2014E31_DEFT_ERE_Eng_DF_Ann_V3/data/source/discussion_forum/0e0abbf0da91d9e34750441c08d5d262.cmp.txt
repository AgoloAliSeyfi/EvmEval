Sri Lanka

-- I'm sorry what? Why?

China

-- The Chinese government is ultra capitalist but it does not terrorize people at the level of invasion.

Zimbabwe

-- Mugabe is just an African Nationalist. The country is a dictatorship but contrary to thought almost all Africa countries are independent of there government. Life goes on regardless - the level of infrastructure is too weak, they haven't developed in the right way. ++ The only reason people dislike Zimbabwe is because he exiled the white people from Zimbabwe and ceased there land.

Yeman

-- Yemen is poor and run by an oligarchy, invade and you'll leave with more people and more western sympathetic oligarchy. What have you done but wast ammunition and reduce oil prices for about 2 years (to piss of Russia).

Bahrain

-- O NO, the royal guard killed some violent protesters. Lets destroy the government and solve things!!

================================ ========

Invading a place doesn't magically create human rights, democracy and wealth. That's a myth propagated to the citizenry to justify wars in the interest of the government invading.

We live under the we you do because people starve and suffer elsewhere - such is the nature of he world. Inevitable poverty.

My arguement was merely that we cannot intervene in every country where there exists instability and corruption.

Why don't we intervene in North Korea? The same reasons we haven't intervened in many other countries who's leaders exercise ruthless power over their citizens. We didn't intervene when the Sri Lankan government were slaughtering the Tamil Tigers, or during the Rwandan Genocide, or when the Yemen/Syrian/Bahrain government shot at their protesters, or when Mugabe began killing opposition.

These are only recent events. Countless over atrocities have taken place without our intervention. Stalin, Mao ZeDong, Pol Pot, Idi Amin... To name but a few.

Clearly I may be wrong, feel more than welcome to correct me.

That doesn't mean that they don't benefit from the intervention.

How do they benefit from it? Having our companies lose millions on oil fields that they cannot use? On the various countries being cut off from the oil? On having to spend hundreds of millions on a no fly zone?

North Korea is as bad, no, i meant WORSE than Nazi Germany.

Aside from the lack of free speech, capitalism and being made to worship the leader, the country has an awfull amount of cruelty.

If an individual complains about his way of life, inadvertently says something bad about Kim Jong, or the country, then he, his children and his parents are all taken away to a concentration camp.

<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/04/north-korea-political-prisoners-amnesty">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011...soners-amnesty</a>

Amnesty estimates there to be 200,000 prisoners held in concentration camps for offences like these, there the men, women, children are held indefinetly.

Poison gas has been used on inmates, with this shocking report from a defector of him witnessing a new nerve gas being tested on a family whilst scientists observe from above. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/feb/01/northkorea">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/feb/01/northkorea</a>

Public executions are also done regularly, and barbed wire fences, land mines and anti-aircraft defences guard the compounds, as this report shows <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3071466/ns/us_news-only_on_msnbccom/t/death-terror-n-korea-gulag/">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3071466/...n-korea-gulag/</a>

This video from an escapee talks about the 10 metre trenches outside the prison camp, with metal spikes to impale anyone who jumps <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=6e3_1226613958">http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=6e3_1226613958</a>

So why did we interven in Nazi Germany in 1939, and in Iraq 2002, but not in North Korea 2011?

America intervened during the cold war...it led to the current situation.

America ceased to fight because it would have been tantamount to aggression against China, whom border the North. China would in no way appreciate any new aggression because they prefer to have a dilapidated communist state on their doorstep when the alternative is something like south Korea, which is capitalistic, extremely pro-western and essentially the antithesis of Chinese culture; and would therefore probably alter chinese culture, or demonstrate the temptations of capitalism to its people.

Try not to think in such a simplistic and imperialistic way; we have no right to go attacking states we disapprove of, and in this instance as i have hopefully shown, it would be extremely impractical.

Anyway, North Korea will most likely self destruct in the next decade or so.

I don't disagree.

French minister lose there most hated foreign enemy.
One oil rich vassal state. (this is a bonus, not a motive)
One African country that was actually in growth goes back into decline.
One less dictator.

I'm actually happy he's beating them off. I watch Libyan news every afternoon (cable) and things are going well. -- NATO took down the second major power station and there was a government victory demonstration in Sabha.

Hmm.. I don't know how I feel about this. I don't really know enough to have a solid opinion but I do think that the UN resolution was absolute rubbish &amp; NATO has been nothing but a joke. I don't support Gaddafi at all but it's clear that neither side couldn't care less about civilians getting killed. Another thing, I don't think we hear much about ^ on the news either, they're too selective over what they tell us <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/hmmm.gif" alt=":hmmm:"/>
