[Well, I did. Far left kook websites letting an jilted ex-wife break bad don't count. And you did get the facts wrong about so many other things....

And you got one wrong AGAIN (bolded)&gt; Callista is the THIRD wife, not the second... Again, do you bother to do ANY research before wasting my valuable time?

Get your FACTS right before you shoot off your mouth.

I'm sorry, I am usually much more careful. Ask Lone Laugher. I'm aware that Calista is his third wife.

Please stop the pretense that you can dismiss the messy details of Newt's life by attacking the sources.

Newt is a serial adulterer. He left his first wife when she had cancer. She had financial problems because Newt failed to pay her child support. He left his second wife after she was dx with MS. He's on his third marriage. He is not a moral man.

His first wife never had cancer, dipwad. She had a benign growth removed. And they had already agreed to divorce some time BEFORE she went in for her surgery.

And that's just for starters.

Maybe if you read something other than the Internet equivalent of Jerry Springer, you'd know something real.

Legally. Yes. Clinton broke several federal statues. People have gone to prison and lost their jobs for a lot less.

Politically. Not so much. He was still popular and the country was willing to forgive him and frankly, his being acquitted was a forgone conclusion. If he had Obama's economic numbers, he'd have been run out on a rail.

The millage that could have been gotten out of it was gotten when Ken Starr nailed down that he lied. They should have censured him and left it at that.

no. he didn't violate federal statues. everyone lies about cheating when their wife is in the room.

<img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/woohoo.gif"/> kenny starr spent 70 million of our tax money for a blue dress.

And Republicans across the country are wasting millions upon millions enacting laws that they KNOW are not Constitutional and will get struck down, like drug testing in order to get assistance, and voter disenfranchisement.

Wingnuts love to waste taxpayer money.

Hate to break it to you, pusbag, but wiping your ass with the Constitution doesn't make you an expert on it. Which might explain why you keep claiming "Constitutional rights" that don't actually appear anywhere in it.

Or maybe it's just that you're delusional.

As much as I truly hate to distract attention from the leftists boobs frantically dancing around, begging to be noticed for the first time in their pathetic lives, I would like to menion how interesting I found it that Perry is suddenly touting a tax idea he stole from Newt. Newt's had the plan for an optional flat tax (and his is 15%, not 20% like Perry's) for weeks on his website, and gloriosky! Here's Perry spouting it like he expects everyone to marvel at his creativity.
