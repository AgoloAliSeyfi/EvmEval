I did link to a news report that 84% of all public transport spending is in London and the South East, less than 1% is in the North East. Moreover council sports budgets in Scotland were slashed because of the Olympics (source: Scotsman I'll dig it out later). My use of 'south-east' and 'London' is not an attempt at racist conspiracy rhetoric, as you imply. I'm a staunch unionist, I just notice discrepancies. Cameron has bent over backwards to help the City of London in recent EU talks; in the oil and gas industry, due to constant windfall taxation, the UK is not a stable place to explore new seams of oil and gas revenue (though not as major as before, still significant), moreover many of the manufacturing and construction jobs that are associated with oil and gas paraphernalia, are not made here but imported. It's not a racist conspiracy theory to note that one sector is milked as a cash cow and one is treated with kid gloves. I know the oil is less plentiful and I find Salmond banging on about it rather distasteful but, as much as I find the man odious, he has a point.

If you want to talk about it more PM me <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

So BAE is English but banks are Scottish? You've got 'Andy Murray syndrome' - British when they're doing well, Scottish when they're not.

So your opinion of the north is:

they're subsidising leeches
but we shouldn't help to promote private business there from the south
northern people are lazy for not finding jobs (outside of London, which are hard to find)
it's their fault for going down the pits

You're a funny one. Kudos for making me laugh

No, my problem with them is that they're quite happy to vote in the Labour party (who opened the flood gates to immigration as basically f@cked over their own supporters with regards to jobs and housing), who closed all the Grammar schools and they do this so that Labour can steal money from the rich and give to these people....

BAE obviously stands for British, but does that mean it's part Welsh, English and Scottish? No, most of the company will have English origins! Same goes with BP, its "British", but it's mostly an English company.

No, that's not what your article said. It said 84% of planned infrastructure projects are in London and the South East. This doesn't show anything about general expenditure - indeed, if anything, it'd generally be indicative of underinvestment. However, in fact, this is due to the Olympic Games - a one-off national event.

Council budgets are entirely devolved. They are not altered by the UK Government.

The current government instituted a significant bank levy which massively outpaces any taxes on the oil industry.

As for the "City of London", David Cameron was defending the UK financial services industry, which employs over 150,000 people in Scotland. It is hugely important to our economy, from a Scottish or British perspective.

A lot of these arguments could equally well be applied to the North of England, if you really wanted to have a country where there was no subsidy you'd need to separate off the South East of England.

This is a bit old, but still quite an interesting read:

Here is a link specifically saying transport spending

<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-16235349">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-16235349</a>

The situation in the financial and oil&amp;gas industries isn't as comparable. You've mentioned the bank levy but that is in response to the financial crisis of 2008, of which the british financial sector paid a key role, and required part or in some cases full nationalisation. If a similar crisis had befallen the oil and gas industries, I would agree.

I agree that the financial services are hugely important to the entire economy however.
