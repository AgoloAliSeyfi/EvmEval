Many of the tea party candidates won office by claiming that Barack Obama and Dems in Congress don't listen to the will of the people.

Are they ready to listen to the will of the American people by increasing taxes on the rich and cutting defense to balance the budget?

Considering their record of opposing things that the majority of Americans support, I won't hold my breath but it would be nice to see that at least one of them had some principles.

Wow. Only 61% support taking money from someone else to pay their bills. Gee, lets see. If we dont tax the rich to pay down the deficit, they will have to tax.....me! Not too hard to see why that number might not be even higher. I say hurray for the 39% who understand that it is wrong to violate the rights of others.

Roughly the same amount of Americans (60%) support keeping marriage between a man and a woman. Funny how the left doesnt want majority rule on that one. Hypocrites.

its not even the pot calling the kettle black. its the apple calling the orange red.

the Dems are not the ones who blew a hole in the budget. its absolutely absurd to even claim that

Whatever argument can be made against the GOP by the Dems on spending, has been destroyed in the 16th months of Obama's spending.

Neither party has the guts to curtail spending, Democrats and Republicans are just a bunch of Statist cowards, nothing less.

Topic - Go ahead, let's increase all those damn taxes. But once your silly system is destroyed: "bottom-top, top-down, and inside out", we'll be the ones laughing at you.

Did I defend Republican spending?

Bottom line is that neither party has done jack about controlling spending and balancing the budget. No not even Clinton who's "surplus" was the result of spending "extra" money in the SS system and the result of an unprecedended boom in the economy that turned out to be more of a bubble.

The only thing to do that might result in actual long term sustainable budget surplus is real cuts to everything.

The scary reality that most don't want to face is that over time, no matter what we do with tax rates, revenue remains around 18% of GDP. It's never much higher or much lower than that for any length of time. And with spending being around 25% of GDP, there's clearly a problem that can only be solved by serious cuts.

You basically blamed the Democrats for the federal debt even though it has been rising ever since Reagan, both parties.

The Democrats wanted to raise taxes on the rich, and they know what will happen if they do that. The GOP will run around screaming socialism/communism/islamism/kenyanism/etc

The GOP will never reduce the debt. At most they will make a few tiny cuts so it doesn't affect them electorally and they'll let the Democrats raise taxes and then run against the Democrats on that issue.

I still say Obama was a damn fool for extending the cuts for 2 years. The compromise was good, but that timing is awful. He played right into the Right's hand. They're going to use it as an election issue for 2012.

So you're giving them kudos for "wanting to raise taxes" even if they went ahead and did the opposite?

No doubt about that, the timing was perfect for Republicans electorally.
