We live in Columbia County, so we got our bill already, and we have to pay a lot more than you will, per capita, to cover Walker's cuts. So while normally, I would have been a tad po'ed at a 15% increase in one year, I started laughing.

If everyone else in my small town and others like it all around this great state of ours open a similar joyful envelope, it will be impossible for our governor to NOT get recalled. Folks will be lined up outside the polling places, just waiting to color in the dot next to ANY Democrat that goes up against these baboons!

Way to go, fools. I'm going to tell the clerk that I will pay the increase AFTER the recall effort is successful, so I'm sure the money will go to help my poor, overextended community survive, not to line some politician's pockets. Or those of his rich cronies.......

The Budget repair bill was supposed to have language eliminating some of the municipalities local control over your property tax rate and therefore should have kept your property taxes from going up. I think you need to look at the valuation of your home year over year.

It's another world out here - when we bought our house in '98, it was assessed at $67K. This year's assessment is $147K, just 13 years later. All of the reasons that we left Madison are catching up with us, sadly.

The house needed SOME work, but we certainly didn't put $80K into it. When we refinanced last month, the CU's assessor only valued us at $129K. Most of the old people in our town sold their houses and moved into small apartments near their medical providers or in with family members in the past few years.

We go to the open book meetings and try to get information, but they aren't interested in listening to us or telling us what has changed. I don't mind paying taxes, but I hate to see so many of my neighbors having to move because of these huge increases.
