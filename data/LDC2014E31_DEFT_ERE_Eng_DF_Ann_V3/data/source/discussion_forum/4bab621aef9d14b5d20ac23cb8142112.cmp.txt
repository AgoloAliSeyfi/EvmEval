Hi Everyone......

Have found an open computer at the library so thought it was a good time to let you know how things are.

The fire on Tuesday gutted the pumphouse, a 6'x6'x8' structure. Hence the name, the well pump was inside and there won't be any water for awhile. The fire spread to the entryway and pretty much gutted that along with the phone lines. What is left of the entryway has to come down along with perhaps the outside living room wall and the deck of course. Somewhere along the line, the fire jumped to the house roof which was very unfortunate. The fire department had a difficult time extinguishing that portion and roof boards were damaged leaving a hole. In order to find the real extent of what the fire did, the north wall of the kitchen will need to be removed (inside and out) along with some of the vault down to the studs, and the roof of course. Due to the age of the home (1890) and the extensive remodeling that has occured before I got there, nothing can be determined from the attic or the roof portion in that particular section unless a tear down occurs.

The house if livable, although without water. I made a decision to stay in the house and not go to a hotel. There is some smoke damage and I am finding soot in the weirdest places like behind the top of the toilet tank. If I can get outside every 4 hours for a breath of fresh air, it's helpful.

The first well pump person came this morning and was of no help. The second person that came was very helpful and is coming again tomorrow with an estimate. The adjuster and the contractor are also coming tomorrow and that will all take a couple of hours at least to sort through things. A structure has to be built first before the pump can be installed.

Was a fitful night for sleep, but it was tempered with the fact that I live in a small community and have people around me that are totally awesome. From the passerby's Tuesday morning who called 911 and went in the house to rescue any animals at their own peril, to those who lived close and kept me informed and stayed until the rescue people left. The phone was busy with people calling, sometimes twice <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/smiles.gif"/> to make sure that I was OK. Special thanks have to go out to my assistant Randy, who on the last 10 minutes of my commute was with me via phone the entire time. I cannot express my gratitude for that action.

The fire was in the same exact location that it was 30 years ago. Pretty freaky.

Thank you for your thoughts, it's getting me through. For some reason though, the song Disco Inferno keeps running through my head. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/smiles.gif"/>

Deb, Glad to see that your Ok. Well so to speak considering your dilema. I hope the insurance corrects things quickly for you as you have spent considerable time and money fixing up the place. Must be pretty nerve racking i imagine. On the good side though your handy man will be around for some time apparently. Good luck girl and hang in there! <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/smiles.gif"/>

Sorry to hear about the fire, been there as a kid, but really glad to hear that you are well and on top of thing's.

Do the repair work and sell the place, in about 25 years or so <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/eek.gif"/>.

If you have to go to the library to use the computer, maybe you should do some research on the houses history, who built it and lived there, and any mysterious circumstances. I love old houses, and ghost stories <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/smiles.gif"/>.

Sounds like your neighbours are top notch people.

Debbie, do you mind putting up some pictures of the place? I have a hard time picturing the "pump room" and walk way and deck in my mind.

"plane ticket, put the workboots, patterned stockings and tool belt back in the closet along with the bra that covers nothing"

Hoping that none of this was damaged in the fire. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/smiles.gif"/> ) <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/wink.gif"/>

Hooray -------for a temporary phone line!

Hello everybody,

People started to show up here at 7:30 this morning and it's been quite a flurry of activity. Two contractors, an adjustor, the phone company plus a subrogate investigator. The investigator was called in thinking that the former owners actions had somehow caused the fire with the way the heat tape was being utilized. With that phone call, everything here ground to a halt. Debris could not be removed, the plumber could not commence, nothing could go any further.

At 2:30 pm, the investigator did determine that it was the pump motor itself which was the cause, not the former homeowners actions. Since it is so late in the day now, everything has to wait until tomorrow. On Friday, the new pump motor will be put on, and a temporary structure will be built. The entryway will be torn off and debris will be picked up, but far as anything permanent, that is weeks if not months away.

Thanks for all your concern.........
