Other nations were working on developing the A-Bomb? But I thought the reason we executed Julius and Ethel Rosenburg was for telling that secret to the Soviets? I thought only the US knew how to make one, for a period of time anyway.

Am I wrong? I'm beginning to wonder if I know any US history.

This business of flinging URLs around isn't getting us anywhere, CurveLight. WHAT exactly is defective about the documents relied on by RetiredGySgt and namvet? Why are THEY not good evidence of what transpired?

Are the doctored?

Are they incomplete?

Is there doubt about their authenticity?

No to all those questions. He even uses magic intercepts for his claims. He is twisting the information and in some cases outright lying.

But what is the point if you refuse to even read the documents?

</quote>

I have glanced through all the URLs, sir. Each seems to support the factual allegations the posters have claimed they would. But BOTH scenarios cannot have occurred, and at this point, I am kinda sorta thinking this is as far as I'm gonna get.

I'm heavily inclined to believe what you have posted, RetiredGySgt, but I still have some doubts. More or less the same place I was in when this thread started.

The info they are pointing to is an incomplete picture.

In many ways, what you are saying about both scenarios being impossible to co-exist is exactly what was taking place. There was the "official" position that the nukes were the only way to force japan to an unconditional surrender then there was the more factual position that japan was trying to surrender.

In both countries there was a power struggle between the military and civilian leadership, but their agendas were in role reversals. In Japan the civilian side was more apt to seeking peace than the military but in the US it was the military that was pushing for peace more than the civilian leadership under Truman.

In regards to your OP question about the "necessity" of the bombs, what does it tell you that every top US military leader has agreed that the bombs were not necessary?

Despite the Germans having already surrendered I think we should have dropped an A bomb on Berlin, or at least Hamburg, simply as a gesture of good will to the Japanese, to prove to them that Hiroshima and Nagasaki was not a racist attack.

Meh......in the spirit of multiculturalism, we should have also dropped one on Nairobi, and Mexico City, and maybe an Alutian Island to pick off some eskimos.

Between the two of us, it was me that has proven that even after both bombs Japan did not give an unconditional surrender. So if a "moron" had to educate you on a basic historical fact, where does that place you?

The question of the bombs' role was not in trying to figure out how to end WW2. They were used to figure out how to start what became known as The Cold War.

You could not think of any better way to demonstrate what an idiot you are.

In terms of killing people the bombs have been overrated. What was and is so amazing is the force unleashed by a single weapon and the radiation field it leaves behind.
