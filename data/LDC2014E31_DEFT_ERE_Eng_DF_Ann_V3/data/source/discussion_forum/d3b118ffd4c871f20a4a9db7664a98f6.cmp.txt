Hello all

Frustrated with the poor customer service I have just got off the phone from the incompetent company and found this thread.

What a shambols!

Since transfer from busy bees, each month the money is taken from my husband and my pay on or even before the 25th of the month and still after the first of each month no money is in the on line account to make payment to our childcarer.

When you get through on the phone, if your patience lasts that long, you are fobbed off with a variety of excuses:
- it is not us it is your employer
- if we had been paid we would make the money available
- it is an it issue
- it is a systems issue
-it is a teething problem
- or worst, we are sorry but your money is not available!

I rang on friday and after 15 minutes holding and a further 15 minutes of being fobbed off -I gave up. Today, monday, I had an answerphone message from customer services and they said that they had not been paid and I could email if I wanted to talk to the person who called me but they do not have a direct line so I couldn't call them back.

I rang this evening and there were no records or her call on my account. Also she had gone home. I asked if they could tell me when the money would be in my account they said that was not possible.

I asked who is responsible for them because after 6 months of this problem, continued complaining and phoncalls and saying sorry to my child care provider each month that my money I want to pay them is lost in cyberspace (or in computrshares bank account???)- I am fed up. The representative said they are regulated by ofstead. I said fine can she give me their number and she said she would put me on hold. She then said she could not give me their number. I asked if I could complain to them (OFSTEAD). She stated only if I registered a complaint with them first (computershare). I said I complain the 3 or so times a month I ring with the same problem. She said they were not complaints but enquires or problems which they resolve. I said each month I state it is a complaint. She stated that they could not take complaint over the phone but they had to be in writing or by email.

At the end of my teather, I just said fine I will contact ofstead and put the phone down. I went straight on line but could find no deatils on ofsteads website and I am now going to do the following:

1- continue to negotiate with my employer to see if we can find a childcare tax provider that is not computershare

2- approach my local MP as this company seem to be within their own jursdiction with no reproach

3. fill out this page of the WATCHDOG (bbc) website.

<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/watchdog/gotastory/">http://www.bbc.co.uk/watchdog/gotastory/</a>

I suggest you spread the word and get as many people having these problems to fill out the 'got a story' page and maybe they can pick up the story.

Let see what we can achieve!
