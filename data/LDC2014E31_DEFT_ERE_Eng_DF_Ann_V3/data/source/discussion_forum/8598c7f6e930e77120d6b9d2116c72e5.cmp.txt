On a side note, prison is supposed to be a rehabilitation facility but that is not the case. I have met a few guys that have really turned there lives around on there own accord but they had a very good support system. Their family was there to support them along with other loved ones, children, wives, girlfriends ect. But most of the time some guy gets tossed in the state or federal pen and he links up with guys from the same crew that are operating on the outside. Prison is a more focused problem of what exists on the outside, the drug/arms/sex trade is still there. If these guys would spend there terms exposed to another world instead of a hyper focused version of the current world they live in then maybe they could see the light.

As for the War on (insert topic) it is all a joke. Political campaign's are won and loss on these platforms it is a joke. We can never take out the head honchos in these matters because a lot of careers would be ruined because of it. No more drugs = no more DEA.

But maybe if we came up with more serious programs other than DARE and offered free outreach programs in the bad parts of our towns and city's we could make a difference. I am not talking about middle school and high school we have to get them in grades school. But that takes money, and a lot of time it is hard to get money for projects that will not show results for 10 to 20 years, maybe even longer.

Here is one source for starters; the guy who owns this site is a retired DEA agent. He has a radio show called the Expert witness Show on WBAI 99.5 FM in New York City. They predicted 911 long before it ever happened. You can log on to that site at <a href="http://www.wbai.org">WBAI, New York - 99.5 FM Pacifica Radio - Home</a> and check the program schedule. It's been a while since I tuned in, since the show was changed from late in the evening to about 5 <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised"/> clock PM New York City time.

Agreed. We're reliving The Fall of Rome. But....don't blame everything on Bush. It started long, long before he came to power. Besides, he's a good man for standing up to Terrorist Islam, which is a major contributor to the downfall of the West.:AR15firing:

I don't believe that Bush's intention is to fight terrorism...one does not need to protect his home by invading his neighbor's, all they need to do is secure their own borders. Bush has his own hidden agenda which conflicts with his duty as the president of this country. Jesus said that one cannot serve two masters; Bush is a member of a secret society called the skull and bones. Any political figure who is a member of a secret society has bound themselves to perform what they are required to do, such members if in the government is bond to betray the trust of the people and the office to which they sit.
