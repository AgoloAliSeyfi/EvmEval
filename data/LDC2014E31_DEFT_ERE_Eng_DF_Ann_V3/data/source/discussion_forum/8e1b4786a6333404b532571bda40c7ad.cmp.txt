There are certain things that are outside the realm of scientific investigation, such as what came before the big bang, or was it the creation of a deity. Science doesn't really attempt to explore these questions, because they aren't testable.

It's not really about labeling something as the "The Truth", or convincing anyone of it. The objective of scientific inquiry is to prove or disprove existing theory through experiment. In all areas of science, theories make predictions. If they don't, they're not really any good as theories. By designing experiments to test the predictions, we either support the theories, or force ourselves to modify or discard them. If you wish to convince yourself of something, you can study the experiments and come to your own conclusion. I'm more interested in convincing myself than convincing someone else. Curiosity and scepticism are traits that vary from person to person.

Some theories, like General Relativity or Quantum Mechanics, are so good making accurate predictions that they are considered extremely reliable. From these we derive laws and principles, like the "Law of Gravity" or the Pauli "Exclusionary Principle". Without these theories, we wouldn't be able to do things like build atomic reactors, or fly spaceships on long trips. Euclidian Geometry and classsical physics are very good at predicting things like planetary motions, but there is slight error between the predictions and experiment. GR removes that error, so it supercedes Newtonian Physics as our best (most accurate) theory of gravity. In the same manner, QM superceded NP in describing sub-atomic reactions, and the Copernican Solar System superceded Ptolemaic one.

Humans have a natural desire or instinct to understand the universe around us. Physics has a "holy grail", The theory of everything, the "Grand Unified Theory". For some people, Religion serves the purpose of a theory of everything, and that person is happy because he has a theory of the universe that he can accept.

But most forms of "creation science" are static- the theory is invented, and the facts are either made to fit, or are discarded. This means that Science has no place for it, since there's nothing to test except those things that support the theory- it's not permitted to discard the theory if it disagrees with experiment.

I 2nd that one ZFBoxcar, ID has no place in public primary schools. Maybe in a college philosophy class, but not in public school biology classes.

Teaching ID in science class is analogous to teaching flat earthism in geography or geology.

You are confusing evolution and Social Darwinism. Social Darwinism is racist because it teaches that white people are biologically superior since they were able to conquer other peoples. This was a misuse of the term "survival of the fittest". Surival of the fittest means that if a certain disaster befalls a species, then only those equipped to survive that disaster will survive, and then their offspring will also have the necessary survival trait. Applied to the social order of humanity it means that any group that happens to be powerful has the NATURAL RIGHT to dominate or destroy all other groups. Evolution is correct, social darwinism is ********.

Uh, I think you're confusing Herbert Spencer with Friedrich Nietzsche.

Herbert Spencer was the father of Social Darwinism which is racist. I don't see where Nietzsche comes into this.

Social Darwinism is a socioeconomic theory, it has nothing to do with race. To simplify it, the best and the brightest will rise to the highest positions. Another idea called eugenics championed by such people as Nietzsche and Francis Galton argues the idea that some people are genetically inferior.

Sorry, I made a blanket generalization that I should not have made. I should have said, "Social Darwinism is the application of the theory of natural selection to human institutions." It has often been used to justify racism and/or imperialism, but I suppose, in itself, it does not have to be racist. I wasn't confusing it with Nietzsche.

I see Nietzsche being discussed here. If anyone wants any clarification on his policies and ideas, I can be of use. Nietzsche's idea of the Ubermensch or 'Overman' is often interpreted as a reference to eugenics, since the emergence of the overman would condemn many of the lesser beings to death. Nietzsche was not a proponent of mass slaughter or genocide, but meant his Ubermensch to be the very pinnacle of human development. Nietzsche characterized the Ubermensch as a creature of exalted strength, talent, and intelligence. A candidate for Ubermensch would be Gautama Buddha, or any other transcendant and revolutionary person.

Nietzsche was not a proto-Nazi as he often made out to be, nor was he a rude and domineering fascist. He was a polite and artistic man that ridiculed the anti-Semitism of his homeland. He is often confused with Nazism because his weak-minded sister, Elizabeth, married a proto-Nazi named Bernhard Forster. Nietzsche protested this union and ridiculed anti-Semites as brutes.

Also remember that Nietzsche was by definition against any large ideological system, he was a rugged individualist and a wandering hermit. He would never support the vast herd mentality that allows eugenics.

Of course, he did not have much sympathy for the lowest of mankind, and he often described pity as an obstacle that he (or Zarathustra) had to overcome.

As to the title of thread:

May intelligent design die a thousand deaths and be condemned to eternal oblivion!
