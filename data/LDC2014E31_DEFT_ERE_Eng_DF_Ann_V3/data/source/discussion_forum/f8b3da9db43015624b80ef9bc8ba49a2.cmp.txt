They showed the video just like all the other news did yesterday and then said that the video was to grainy to make any judgment and people should wait until the medical reports about it come out.

</quote>

Ahhh....

Yes, they've got their talking point sorted out. Pretty much all the RWers were repeating that meme yesterday...."it's too grainy, so we should wait."

Of course they want to wait, that video is damning.

Thanks for your response though.

It was Zimmerman's Attorney who said the video was grainy. Not Fox news. My Bad for how I wrote it.

But the Cop was looking at the back of his head.
Fox news comments were that everyone should wait until medical reports came out. That too many people on both sides are rushing to judgments before all the evidence comes to light.

Many people watch Fox news not just RWers

The problem with investigative reporting is the kind of dirt that's dug up.

The libs are having a hard time portraying Zimmerman as a crazed racist.

Problems with trying to say he got some sort of pass because his father was a retired judge too.

</quote>

His father has a connection to the State Attny. that prevented the chief detective from doing his job, genius. You'd know that if you got your head out of Limbaugh's fat ass and read something else besides Newsbusters and the WND.

Oh, and explain to us all why suddenly the State Attny. removes himself from the case AFTER he prevents Zimmerman from being arrested? This should be good.

</quote>

There was no connection to the state attorney because Zimmerman's father was a retired judge from Virginia with no connection to Florida.

</quote>

I stand corrected, as the only "connection" seems to be son George and the local police:

It's not a big story. It's only a big story to racist liberals. After all, the two black boys who poured gasoline and set a 13 year old white boy on fire wasn't exactly news to CNN or MSNBC. Black mobs beating up white fair goers at the Wisconsin State Fair never even got a mention. If Fox News doesn't go in for race baiting (and it's not even race since Zimmerman is hispanic), good for them.

</quote>

I agree. If the dead teen had been white this story wouldn't be a blip on anyones radar.

Typical race baiting.

I did see a good segment on O'Reilly yesterday on it though. So it is getting coverage. Hell the local news down here in Florida was full of it the other day.

</quote>

I'm curious Claudette, can you define this "typical race baiting" thing for me please?

I don't quite understand exactly what you mean or are referring to by it.

Thanks.

</quote>

Race baiting is easy. You make an issue racial if it wasnt or you pour gasoline on an issue for your personal gain.

So are you saying Zimmerman shot him because he was black, he just doesnt like black people? Because that is what Sharpton and Jackson are implying. Funny how those two never appear when it's black on black crime, why is that? Oh they cant cry racism and get those donations flowing in, brotha gotta make living right?

Zimmerman's DOCUMENTED history of 911 calls and the latest transcript bare witness to his preconceived notions regarding black men (yeah, he's got "black friends" making excuses for him....pity that doesn't change the record).

And where the hell have YOU been for the last 20 years, as both Sharpton and Jackson have REPEATEDLY HELD PUBLICIZED CONFERENCES AND SUCH ACROSS AMERICA REGARDING "BLACK ON BLACK CRIME"?

Try a little honest research beyond the WND, Newsbusters, NY Post and the Limbaugh like clowns of Fox News for a change.....you'll be shocked as to what's going on in the world.
