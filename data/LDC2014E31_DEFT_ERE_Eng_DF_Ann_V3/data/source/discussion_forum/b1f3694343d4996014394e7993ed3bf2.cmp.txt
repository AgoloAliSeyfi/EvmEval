How could they not? They have ample evidence a predator is operating in their community, but they keep it a secret?

Like with any other crime, they arrest the guy and don't publish/leak full details.

I know a lot more about Paterno than most people do, and characterizations of him as some evil mastermind valuing a winning football program above all else - morality be damned - are flat wrong. If for no other purpose than for people who don't know anything about the man to get the tragic irony of this case (i.e., that it involves the squeakiest of the squeaky-clean) it's been important to set the record straight. It's easy to just conclude that his response makes him a total low-life; the truth is more complicated: he really is a man of impeccable character who did absolutely the wrong thing when presented with this situation, and he deserves to be punished for it.

If it was just this situation, then how do you explain <a href="http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Joe-Paterno-Clashed-with-School-Officials-on-Player-Discipline-134320508.html">the NBC article</a> ? I know a lot of emphasis has been placed on things like Paterno insisting that his football players were also good students, but then what are we to think when we read an article that says Paterno campaigned for (and ultimately won) limitations on the school's ability to discipline athletes for school rule violations?

- Many people here and elsewhere continue to suggest Paterno not doing more made him an enabler of child sexual abuse. This is by and large an incredibly unfair label to stick on him.

</quote>
I disagree. It's a label that applies to him and many others, as you say below. Additionally, fairly or not, with greater (perceived) power, authority, prestige comes greater (perceived) responsibility.

<quote orig_author="TruthCalls">
And finally, in 2002, Paterno DID report what he had been told. If he was an 'enabler' he would not have reported it.

</quote>
He, along with the rest of the administration, are highly invested in the the monetary rewards based on the schools image. Reporting it not to the police, but keeping it within the university, appears to be an action taken to not tarnish the reputation of the school, not to protect a young boy. This is my perception based on my understanding, but I don't think I am alone in it.

<quote orig_author="TruthCalls">
Those who had a legal obligation (Curley and Shultz) to report it to authorities and didn't are far more culpable than Paterno. I don't mean to suggest Paterno should be absolved of any culpability, but sticking the label of enabler on him solely because he's the biggest fish in the pond, without any regard for who really is responsible for what, is disingenuous.

</quote>
If we preface our remarks with 'one enabler among many', does it help ?

<quote orig_author="TruthCalls">
I may have missed it but exactly what was the reason for the case in 1998 to be closed without charges and what, if any, was Paterno's understanding of the allegations and ultimate resolution? I mean, is it unreasonable to consider the possibility that Paterno was not directly involved in the investigation, and was told that it ultimately had no merit, which is why it was closed without charges?

</quote>
I am not completely conversant with everything that happened in 1998. But it is easy to infer that must have played into his retirement in 1999. I'll await further details - but it seems like many of the principals aren't talking - or additional theories before I can make too much of that, though.

<quote orig_author="TruthCalls">
If so, then how much of a factor might this have played in 2002?

</quote>
Not enough, apparently. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/frown.gif"/>

<quote orig_author="TruthCalls">
Did Paterno wonder why, if this was a clear case of child rape, did McQueary wait 24 hours before telling him?

</quote>
I can only repeat, for all involved - reporting it not to the police, but keeping it within the university, appears to be an action taken to not tarnish the reputation of the school, not to protect a young boy.

<quote orig_author="TruthCalls">
And finally, I have often heard the commentary that this was a cover-up to protect the school or football program, but I still don't understand what this exactly means.... The school had nothing to gain but everything to lose by hiding it. Exactly how would it have hurt the school or the football program if Sandusky was exposed right from the start?

</quote>
Doesn't the way people are judging Paterno now help you understand ? I can only imagine that the administration wants to keep *anything* negative under their hat, if they can - even if they feel they did the right thing. I don't know, I think it's a valid question and deserves a better explanation than I have given it here.
