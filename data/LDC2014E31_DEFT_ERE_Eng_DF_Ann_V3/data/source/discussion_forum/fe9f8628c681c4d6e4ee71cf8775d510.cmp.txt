Reading the newspaper today you may have seen an article regarding a teenager called Tariq Aziz. He was part of a scheme organised to document the effect of drone strikes, he was given a camera. On his way to his aunts house he and his 12 year old cousin were slaughtered by an illegal cia drone strike.

What the **** is wrong with America?

Who will go to ****ing court because of this? No-one cos its America, and they are clearly above the law because they have money.

How the **** can America complain about Palestinian home-made rockets when they're using drones without a care in teh world?

Why does America have the right to ****ing attack anywhere its want without any accountability?

It's not a bloody cod killstreak.

Why when they kill civillians do they have the cheek, to quote the Times article to say 'they're has been no collateral damage in drone attacks' when according to the Times again there are pictures of incinerated young children?

Now do you understand why many people, especially muslims have a gripe against the Americans?

At least most muslims are sane, unlike the American goverment who just can't seem to stop committing terrorist acts.

I'm sorry for the swearing, i'm not one to usually swear, but the CIA et al are a joke.

Why the negs? The killing of this and several other innocents is okay? If Iran sent a little drone to America and did the samething, what would the ramifcations be? what would the outcry be like..?

There's nothing illegal about what the U.S is doing. You have no power over the USA--there is nothing you can do to stop them so you are best not to worry about it.

Murder implies premeditation and you have no proof that the Americans are setting out to kill civilians. You are acting like a twonk to be honest. Troops die in accidental 'friendly fire' etc. all the time, its an unwelcome necessity when the goal has to be achieved by violence and terrorists hide in houses and hamlets near civilians, so they are equally to blame.

A troop accpets the risk of death, an innocent civillian should never have that forced upon him. Poor example. If your brother/sister/parents were in that car that was blown up by these oh so accurate missiles, how would you feel matey?

And lol, murder does not have to be pre-meditated lmao.

So they made up the foreign policy stuff to hide their true agenda which is the hatred of the western way of life and of the world's existence!!! they are run by Dr Evil himself with his evil plot to destroy the world!!!!!!

This is the real world not your stupid fictional film where evil geniuses exist and want to destroy everything.

Where did I say they "made up the foreign policy stuff"? I said quite clearly that their references to foreign policy are framed with religious overtones (after all, the signatories to bin Laden's 1998 fatwa referred to themselves as the 'World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders'. Can't get more theocratic than that!). Their confrontation with the West is used as a means by which to coerce people within Muslim lands. You can see this as far as Nigeria where Boko Haram - an al-Qaeda affiliate - massacre fellow Nigerians on a regular basis. What do these actions have to do with U.S. foreign policy? If someone decides to blow up a Danish embassy in Islamabad because an independent Danish newspaper printed cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad then that person is a religious fascist who hates freedom. Get used to it!
