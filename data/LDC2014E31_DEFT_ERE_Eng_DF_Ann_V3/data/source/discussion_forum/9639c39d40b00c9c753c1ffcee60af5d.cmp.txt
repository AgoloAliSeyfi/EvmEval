it's short but if you don't want to read it basically a guy in the USA has been arrested for agreeing to meet up with and have sex with a "14 year old girl" who was actually an undercover cop...

surely this is entrapment? he didn't actually do anything because they basically lead him into the situation? sure, it would be a crime if he had actually done this with a 14 year old and something had happened when they met up... but the american police have basically created this whole scenario and lead him into it, feeding him along?

He was arrested after agreeing to meet with her Jan. 12.

this suggests to me that the police officer was the one who suggested everything... coaxed him into it... we don't know the full story but i get the impression that this "14 year old girl" offered him sex on a plate willingly....

would that be legal in this country? i mean i think it's wrong that this guy would meet up with a 14 year old with the intent to have sex... but fabricating the situation... you can't arrest someone for something they haven't done... it's just wrong...

am i the only one who thinks this is messed up?

From previous similar stories, what usually happens is that the undercover officer behind the screen is extremely passive (as a normal young innocent teenager would probably be) and then agrees to meet up with the potential paedophile, if he shows up at the place then he is guilty.

I see nothing wrong with this morally, he knows the girl is 14 and still decides to meet her (having previously stated his intentions through IM).

if that is the case then i understand and agree, it's just the way the article is written it sounds as if the police officer is doing a lot of the work, and it's in america so different laws to here.

They do this and it works, there is even a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Catch_a_Predator">show</a> about it. To me its fine, if the suspect has to make a choice, ie leave his home and go to a location, then I don't really care if he is encouraged.
