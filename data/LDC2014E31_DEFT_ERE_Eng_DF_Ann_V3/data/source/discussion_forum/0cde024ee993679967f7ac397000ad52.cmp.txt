Good point.
Didn't Ted Kennedy go to Duke University in NC for his treatment?
Now why the heck didn't he go to Costa Rica? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>
I'll patiently wait for Old Rocks or Chris to explain that.

OK, not a problem;

Two well-known private hospitals, Clinica Biblica and Clinica Catolica,
where many CCSS doctors practice in the afternoons and evenings, offer
first-class, ultra modern services.

Affiliated with U.S. hospitals, these two private providers, have costs
somewhat higher than the public providers, but still way below anything
found in the States. Most Costa Rican doctors and dentists receive their
basic medical training in Costa Rica. From here, they travel far and wide,
seeking specialized training from the finest teaching hospitals in the
world, often becoming certified in their specialties, in the countries where
they receive their advanced training.

It is not uncommon to find a Costa Rican doctor or dentist, speaking several languages, all learned, while pursuing advanced degrees in foreign countries.
Perhaps it is the CCSS work or the varied travel and study that does it, but
the caring expressed by the doctors and dentists, throughout the country, is
noteworthy in its extreme.

In 1991, two economists from the University of Costa Rica, conducted a survey,
of visitors to this country. Their findings, documented in the study, indicated
that 14.25% of all visitors, came for the express purpose, of receiving medical
care of some type.

Over the years, Costa Rica has attracted those in search of uplifting cosmetic surgery. People from around the world, arrive daily to partake of the healing
waters in over 100 thermal and mineral springs located here.

Dental work, from fillings to implants, is done routinely on people from every
corner of the world. Many people from Latin America plan for their medical
needs from hip replacement to heart valve replacement to be taken care of
by the well-trained and skillful physicians, in Costa Rica, rather than in their
native countries.

Clearly then, not only does Costa Rica offer universal health care coverage
to its citizens, but that same high quality care is available for people from
all over the world.

Let's see, you quoted my post, yet you completely failed to answer the questions I asked.
Here they are again, try again.

It could get a bit crowded if everyone went to Costa Rica, wouldn't it? Ted Kennedy has public insurance that pays his medical bills.
No doubt he's grateful to you for paying his medical bills.

Glad you brought that up!

In America the rich get the best healthcare. Is that how healthcare should be rationed?

Yes, only the rich deserve to have their lives saved. Everyone else deserves to die.

Is this a great country or what?

No, actually Amanda, that is the question.

Should only the rich receive good healthcare?

You're making yourself look foolish. Do you recall in YOUR 'The best healthcare in America is government run' thread where you accused me of not reading the linked article then I handed you your ass with quotes FROM the article? I'm sure you remember because you've been avoiding responding to me in that thread ever since. Here's the thing, earlier in THAT thread I said:

<quote orig_author="Amanda">
I think everyone in the world should get the very best health care.

</quote>

You responded by claiming I hadn't read the article. So my question at this point is do you even read the posts you respond to? Your question, addressed specifically to me: 'Should only the rich receive good healthcare?' was answered in a post you supposedly read even before you asked the question.

Not at all.

It is the very basis of our for profit healthcare system.

How does the single mother with cancer who can't work pay health insurance permiums?
