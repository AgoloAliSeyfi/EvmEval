<quote>
Although the U.S. has about 20 billion barrels of proved reserves, most Americans would be pleasantly surprised to learn that experts believe the nation probably has more than 110 billion barrels of recoverable oil, five times the estimated current supply. A 1995 National Assessment of U.S. Oil and Gas Resources prepared by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) concluded that, in addition to the 20 billion barrels of proved reserves, there are another 30 billion barrels of undiscovered oil that could be recovered using conventional drilling and exploration technology. There are at least 60 billion barrels of inferred reserves which can be recovered with new technology. Including the oil that can be extracted from shale and other unconventional sources, the USGS believes the U.S. has 112.3 billion barrels of oil.

Since 1983, federal land available for oil and gas exploration in the western U.S. - where 67% of the nation's onshore oil reserves and 40% of natural gas reserves are located - has decreased by more than 60%. In total, more than 300 million onshore acres of federal land have been effectively removed from the market for oil exploration. The Clinton Administration's proposal to prohibit new road construction on 43 million acres of federal land will further reduce oil development as the roadless ban will affect areas where oil and gas exploration is being conducted.

The numbers are similarly disturbing for offshore oil development. Over the years, Congress has prohibited exploration and production on more than 460 million offshore acres, which includes virtually all of the best prospects for major new offshore discoveries outside the Western and Central Gulf of Mexico. This relatively narrow portion of the Gulf of Mexico produces the majority of current offshore oil and gas, but new reserves are increasingly short-lived. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the federal portion of offshore drilling, which currently comprises 18% of U.S. production, will rise to nearly a third of domestic oil and gas supply within a decade. Failure to relax federal restrictions in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean and on the Pacific coast would amount to a de facto strangulation of domestic oil production capacity.

By far, the most dramatic example of the federal government's war against domestic oil production is the prohibition on development of the oil-rich Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). The American Association of Petroleum Geologists estimates that ANWR contains at least 9.2 billion barrels of oil. Other estimates show that ANWR probably contains as much as 16 billion barrels, making ANWR the single most important oil reserve in the nation. But environmentalists, citing ecological concerns, have successfully stopped drilling in ANWR even though oil drilling equipment would cover just 2,000 of ANWR's 19 million acres.

um...how do you know if a prediction is true or not.

Do you know what a forecast is?

</quote>

Yeah, ummm, that's how policy is made. Forecasts... The point is, are those entities lying when they forecast such an imminent shortfall?... If what I'm saying is hogwash, then the IEA, Pentagon, DoE, and EIA all must just be pumping the fear card, yes?

</quote>

Forecasts are educated guesses.

I can forecast that it may rain tomorrow, but you can't call me a "Liar" today.

Ever seen what proper land/enviro management looks like where strip mining has been done and finished?

Your bringing up past stuff, that isn't allowed, and is monitored by the EPA.

Some of the most beautiful areas of re-planting, and soil restoration is being done where strip mining has been completed.
******
Bringing up the past, just kills what good can and is being done.

What bull have you been reading? I live in eastern KY.
I have seen the streams run as black slurries from strip mining.

I also remember the last time the shale oil bollocks ran rampant here.
Lots ripped off and nothing came of it.

Your part of the country doesn't have oil shale reserves..........That yuck in your streams is from unregulated coal, and other types of strip mining.

Again, is past atrocities of unregulated mining...........

The EPA won't and doesn't allow that now. Have you seen what good, and wise land management techniques result-in after strip mining is completed? If you did, you wouldn't be posting the past yuck of unregulation of mining.

You can't be serious. Republicans deregulated OSHA and the EPA early in Bush's first term and replaced said regulations with "Volentary Compliance". No way they would allow those industries to be re-regulated. Not gonna happen.

"Republicans deregulated OSHA and the EPA"

OSHA and EPA are regulatory agencies.

How do regulatory agencies become "deregulated?"
