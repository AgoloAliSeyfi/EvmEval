This morning I was watching "Good Day New York" on Channel 5, which is part of the FOX network. The co-host were interviewing a guy who is part of the on-going occupation of Wall St., and were (of course) repeating the media standard line by questioning the man as to why there is no set goals or leadership to advocate such goals. During his response, the man pointed out that it's about all types of people pointing out that nothing is being done about the economic inequality and subsequent crimes perpetrated by Wall St./banking giants (individuals and corporations)....and that you had leaders from various backgrounds join in. He stated that Al Sharpton "a self made man from the streets like me" was joining.....at which time co-host Greg Kelly interjected (twice) that like Al Sharpton, Rupert Murdoch is a self made man.

<img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/confused.gif"/> Come again?

Rupert Murdoch INHERITED HIS FATHER'S OWNERSHIP OF TWO NEWSPAPERS IN THE U.K. (Australia). He did NOT start out in the copy room of some local city paper and work his way up to mogul.

Al Sharpton grew up doing the preacher circuit for his particular brand of religion. Big difference.

I saw this as just another Fox flunkie pushing the "class warfare" line that's heard from the neocon/teabagger pundits in the media. By trying to equate Murdoch as a successful "every man", co-host Greg Kelly pushes the subliminal context that the Wall St. protesters are just "jealous" of "successful people".

Typical Fox BS....but not unexpected.

It means that after inheriting two small nondescript newspapers, Murdoch turned those into a media empire and is a self-made mad. The parasitic class at OWS just want everything for nothing. They are having fun at the expense of New York. They get to take drugs, drink, have lots of anonymous sex in the filth they produce and no one can touch them. This is the life!

Fox News is more balanced than CNN,NBC,or NPR. There are far more Liberals/Socialists who appear regularly on Fox News than do Conservatives on CNN,NBC,or NPR. It has actually been studied and proven that Fox News is more 'Fair &amp; Balanced' than the Liberal Press is. So i can't agree with the OP's paranoid conspiracy thinking on this one.

Unfortunately Class Envy/Class Warfare works. The Democrats are turning American against American. It's an awful 'Divide &amp; Conquer' strategy. Look for them to ratchet this stuff up much more as the Election draws nearer. Anything to hold on to power i guess. It's very sad.

It isn't democrats that turned people against each other. It wasn't democrats who forced people to start going after union workers, and it doesn't take a genius to realize that the wealthiest are getting richer while we are getting poorer. Go ahead and blame the democrats, you just look partisan.

INteresting article on the term class warfare

ZELIZER: Well, conservatives have been very comfortable using it throughout much of the 20th century as a way to attack Democrats. During the 1930s, for example, the American Liberty League said that the dragon teeth of class warfare are being sewn with a vengeance, talking about President Roosevelt.

And since then, you've often heard this charge that we now hear against President Obama that secretly any effort to enact a liberal program is really an effort to divide the classes.

That's where things get complicated. In the original German they wrote Klassenkampfen, which means "class struggles." But some of their critics rendered it more belligerently as "class warfare."

The tone is different on the right, too. The Republican leadership still warn against divisiveness and avoid talking about class explicitly, other than saying that we shouldn't be increasing taxes on the "job creators" but rather "broadening the base." But the conservative media and bloggers have been less circumspect about cleaving society in two. Some of them talk about an all-out war between the producer class and the moocher class. And Fox Business ran a series of segments last spring called "Entitlement Nation: Makers vs. Takers." It isn't entirely clear who the moochers and takers are, but everybody seems to define them as including the 51 percent of American households who don't pay federal taxes, along with those who receive Pell Grants and other forms of government assistance.

And one could argue the right is involved in class warfare, the only problem is, you guys don't notice that you are attacking yourselves.

You never watch CNN do ya? I will give you a clue, CNN is so far up Wall Streets ass they will have to start paying rent. And I cannot believe you just said Fox is balanced. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

I am going with you being another partisan hack that loves to repeat Fox New's talking points ie right wing talking points.
