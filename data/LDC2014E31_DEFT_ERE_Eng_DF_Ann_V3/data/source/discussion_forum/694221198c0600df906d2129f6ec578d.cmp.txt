hello all!

i haven!t posted on MSE for a long time, but i have remained an avid reader, and now it seems it's my turn to ask for some advice on a situation i find myself in.

my partner of 3yrs and i split back in feb/march this year. we were living together, with my 11 yr old son. it wasnt a nasty break at all, we still speak now n then!

i now find myself in a dilemma both emotionally and practically. when my son was born i made a promise to myself that he would never be left to his own devices when he got older, so when he started school i worked hard and became self employed, working from home, so i've always been there for him during school hols etc. when me and my partner got together 3 years ago we decided to combine our businesses and get a proper workshop etc. times were tough due to the workshop rent and bills on top of what we already pay out at home so i started to look for work to help us through and found a job. it was only meant to be temporary but my partner then realised he quite liked the idea of a regular income also, and also found work. i was a little dissappointed but could understand i guess. i stayed in my job and i found my son childcare for school hol's and before and after work. (i worked long hours)

fast forward to now and i'm single again. i have managed to cut my hours to 30 a week, so i'm there for him before and after school but he goes to childcare during school hols. thing is though this childcare place only takes them until they start secondary. <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/frown.gif"/> he starts that in september. so i have been looking around for somewhere else. the council sent through a list of providers for the older children, and there's 2 he can go to, but on calling them it seems the other children they care for are very young - no-one else in his age group.

i have no family near by, and my friends also work fulltime and or night shifts. i could possibly try self employment again, but reducing my hours has seen me take a cut of 6000 a year, self employment might prove even worse. but at least i'll have peace of mind that he's ok. i just don't know what to do for the best!

what do you all do with your older children/teens? how do you balance it all? i've always worked hard for me and my son but sometimes i feel like i'm fighting a losing battle.

my post has rambled a bit sorry <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/redface.gif"/> i was only meant to ask the question, but i'm tired and emotional <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/redface.gif"/>
i look forward to reading your inputs

kind regards

Have you space for a (male) au pair? You would have to see about the hours though as they won't necessarily be fulltime. You may also lose your single person council tax status.

I had au pairs as a single parent when my son was between the ages of 5 and 8. It wasn't always easy but it has enriched my son's life no end. In fact my son is fab at sport now and he wouldn't have got that from me! It can be hard going to work when they are planning a trip to the park.

Hi Merlin,

I can understand your dilemma...I had to work FT for 2 weeks while my boss was on hols and the kids hated it...they like me being at home for them after school.

I'll stick my neck out here but my 11 yo often stays at home on her own for short periods of time (about an hour or so) is this an option for part of the time?

What about his friends parents...would any of them be willing to have him over for tea once a week?

Can you minimise the impact by the way you arrange your working hours, i.e. by doing most hours when he's at school?

What about your ex....after all he should shoulder some of the responsibility for childcare, is he able to organise is hours to take him a couple of evenings a week?

I sympathise completely, I have 4 kids and we both work. I'm lucky that I work for an exceptionally understanding boss who allows me to bring one or two of the kids in if I have to occasionally (I don't abuse that though) and a very good childminder for my lo. my oldest 2 are responsible and trustworthy so I have no problem leaving them on their own (though they are often out with friends)

Hopefully, I've chucked some ideas in the pot for you and best of luck getting it sorted...not all solutions are ideal but sometimes you have to make the best of it.
