By the way January of 2007 was only TWO YEARS before Obama took office.

</quote>

January 2007 was when the car was introduced at an auto show, not when GM started working on it.

The 2006 Detroit Auto Show was in January. By March 2006, GM had made Tony Posawatz the line director for the Volt.

Yeah, I could see if demand doesn't catch up with inventory that these furloughs could be extended past 5 weeks. But I digress, I think we are talking about goats and toothpicks now.

</quote>

Plus, we the taxpayer aren't having to pay out $7500 in rebates for every goat that's purchased. Obama. I hear. want to make ti $10000.. lol..

Then there's the market value. I think goat is going for about %1.20 per pound, whereas a chevy volt is marketed at an economical 'green' price somewhere around $25 per pound... <img src="images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Subsidies for a fuel-efficient vehicle are certainly better for the country than the Bush administration's $100,000 tax writeoff for the 10 mpg Humvee.

</quote>

Some here want to make the Chevy Volt the poster boy for the Obama administration's energy policies. How does that compare to the Humvee, the vehicle that received much larger tax credits during the past administration?

If the Chevy Volt is a symbol of Obama's energy policy, certainly the Humvee H2 is a symbol of Bush administration energy and tax policy - reaping the benefit of a corporate-friendly president and Congress.

Volt..... $40,000.... $7,500.. 150
Humvee.. $120,000.. $100,000... 10

Under the Jobs and Growth Act of 2003, Congress raised the deduction ceiling for these heavy-class vehicles from $25,000 to $100,000, bumped the "bonus deduction" from 30 percent to 50 percent, and left in place the accelerated five-year depreciation schedule. This, in effect, made virtually all three-ton, business-use SUVs fully deductible in the first year.

During the past administration, did you complain about the $100,000 tax break for buying a Humvee H2?

Do you have any references for that? Also, what difference does it make?

Again so what? Working on a concept on the drawing board or clay models isn't quite the same.

Ah, the difference of course being that it was "business use" Humvees not ALL humvees, for one thing. And it was for ALL heavy use business vehicles not just for glorified golf carts. Nice try.

We discussed the tax break for Humvee purchasers in a 2006 thread and you asked the same question.

In reply, Big Brother provided this link for you.

SUV tax loophole widens

<quote>
The explosion of SUV, pickup, and minivan sales in Americaâ€™s passenger vehicle fleet has turned this small businessbenefit into a massive loophole in the tax law. Currently, 38 different passenger SUVs including the Lincoln Navigator, which nets a combined 15 miles per gallon according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Cadillac Escalade (16 mpg), the BMW X5 (18 mpg), the Mercedes-Benz ML55 (16 mpg), and the notorious Hummer H2 (11 mpg) all weigh more than 6,000 pounds. This loophole allows some of the most fuel-inefficient passenger vehicles on the road today to qualify for a significant tax break.

In 2003, lawmakers expanded the tax deduction to a whopping $100,000 as part of the $350 million tax cut package. Yet Congress did not change the weight-based classification of the vehicles, creating a huge benefit for the largest, least efficient vehicles.
</quote>

And here's a Houston Chronicle <a href="http://www.chron.com/business/article/Burns-Guzzle-away-Uncle-Sam-s-buying-1946843.php">column</a> about the tax inventive to buy a gas guzzler:

<quote>
those claiming 100 percent business use of these SUVs could deduct 100 percent of the $89,665 price of the Porsche Cayenne Turbo during 2003 and until late October 2004.
...
Tax savings for guzzler buyers reduce government revenue, increase the federal deficit, increase our trade deficit and send yet more money to the Middle East.

If we were going to devise a formula for wrecking the country, it would be difficult to improve on this one.

We might as well call this portion of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Osama bin Laden Support Fund.
