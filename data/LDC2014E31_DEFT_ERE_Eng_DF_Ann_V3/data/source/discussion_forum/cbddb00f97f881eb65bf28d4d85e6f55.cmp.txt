That is, can the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Syrian_uprising">present situation</a> end with the Assad regime gone, without any really horrible stuff along the way or after, like a really bloody civil war, or ethnic strife/ethnic cleansing? Libya was a simpler social situation, its divisions were regional and tribal, but practically everybody was a Sunni Muslim and an Arabic-speaking Berber. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria#Demographics">In Syria,</a> 90% of the people are Levantine Arabs; the rest are Kurds, Armenians, Turkmens, etc. Since the Kurds are concentrated in the northeastern sliver of the country, if the state falls I could see them making a bid for independence, or autonomy, or union with Iraqi Kurdistan. More disturbingly:

Muslim 90% (Sunnis account for 74% of the population,[144] while the remaining 12% are Shia Â– Alawite, Twelvers, and Ismailis combined [144]), Druze 3%,[144] Christian 9%[144] (majority Antiochian Orthodox, other Christian include Greek Catholic, Assyrian Church of the East, Armenian Orthodox, Protestants and other various denominations).

And the Assad regime is Alawite. Rather the reverse of the situation in Saddam's Iraq, where a Sunni minority predominated over a Shi'a majority. And just as volatile.

So, is there any chance this situation won't lead to the kind of religious-ethnic cleansing we saw in Iraq? Is there any way that can be avoided?

Fire, explosions and blood. Much, much blood.

I predict Assad will do a Beria. Dead in a basement on his knees.

Funny how despite being reverse both regimes were Baathist although Syria fought with us in the First Gulf War which was also weird IMO.

You say that as if "Levantine Arab" was some sort of cohesive ethnic group in Syria. Read a little deeper in the wikipedia article.

Horrible compared to what?

16,000+ children starve to death every day in the world. That's about 670 per hour, or 10-11 kids dying of starvation every minute.

Syria is already a problem country in the Middle East (lacking oil), especially in the northeast area. So the likely death toll from starvation in Syria (kids alone) is probably 1,500 or so per month. Given the months that this has gone on already, they have probably lost 10,000-12,000 of their future generation so far.

The death toll in the Egyptian revolution was only 800-900 people, with just 2,000-3,000 injured. The longer Libyan revolution/civil war is estimated at 6.000-9,000 civilians killed (plus about 15,000 soldiers).

Revolutions or other government changes are minor blips in the mortality rate.
Compared to their continued neglect of their population, the death of even hundreds of government leaders and a few thousand of their followers or soldiers is barely statistically significant. And the new government often pays attention to improving the lot of its citizens, at least for a while.

So the eventual 'regime change' in Syria will probably be bloody &amp; violent, but not particularly horrible for most citizens; likely to lead to improvement, eventually.
