Well basically the report says that Britain hands out over 9 billion pounds worth of aid every year, a substantial amount to Brazil which is richer than us, what is the reasoning to that! Also Britain gives over 1 billion pounds to India, understandly there is a large percentage of Indians living on the poverty line but surely their government should do something about it. They have their own space program and have the most millionaires and billionaires compared to anywhere else in the world. This foreign aid could be used for such greater use at home, ie NHS, education system, apprenticeships.. I dont understand this is beyond reasoning for me!

Their GDP per capita is much lower and the vulnerable are ignored by the government. Have you not seen the favelas?

Although the GDP is lower I don't really think it's a good idea giving unnecessary aid to emerging economies. Our distribution of aid is really messed up tbh.
