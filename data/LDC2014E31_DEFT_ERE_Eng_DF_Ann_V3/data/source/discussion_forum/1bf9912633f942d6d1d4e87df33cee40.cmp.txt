Many people aren't poor because they're lazy, they're poor because they had poor educational opportunities, or because they lack some of the talents required for a high salary, such as having a high intellect or strong people skills. More to the point, many people have disabilities or long term illnesses which harm their earning prospects. And some people are just unlucky, and end up with damaged prospects through no fault of their own (say if someone was born into a broken family with drug and alcohol problems, and ended up without the level of parental support required to succeed in education and then the workplace). All of these things limit earning capacity, making people poor for reasons not of their own making. To then penalise these people by potentially allowing them to die if they become ill seems to me to be cruel and heartless beyond measure.

Considering the low levels of social mobility in this country, and the increasing correlation between parental income and one's own income, you'd think that people might realise that some people are born with more social advantages than others, and thus can cope with misfortune more easily than others, say the cost of a major operation.

I absolutely agree with you on the subject- what Americans fail to realise that there are are diseases that do not discriminate between poor and rich. Besides, certain health conditions and injuries affect long term employment prospects, so some people get caught in a vicious circle- they can't work because they can't afford treatment, and they can't afford treatment because they don't work. When my father has injured his hand in an accident, he received all the medical help he needed, hence his hand healed properly and he can work, contributing to the economy. If we lived in America, he would either be crippled or still paying off his debt- thank god we are not American.

There's only a big fuss in the US because the insurance companies are trying to protect their monopoly. How many republicans get campaign contributions from the insurance companies? Money is a good motivation to lie.

It surprises me how selfish and utterly uncaring some people can be. It reminds me of the story where a community decides to hire a private security force in their area, they then realise that they don't really need the police anymore and so lobby to reduce taxes going towards police. They are rich and powerful in politics so taxes are cut. Their community thrives but the community down the road slips into chaos as the police can't grapple with the crime due to the cuts. The richer community then points to the poorer community and says well if you weren't lazy and controlled crime you could improve your area, get more business and money then you might be able to hire a security force yourself. Ironic when the high crime slum is a product of the richer communities greed.

Yes, there are people that are on benefits for a reason, such as being made redundant, disabilities etc. The people i am talking about are those who choose not to work because they would rather do nothing and get free money. Dont tell me they do not exist, because i know a few of them myself.

As for the other reasons such as low education and poor opportunity. I think you are indirectly insulting those with lesser intelligence than you consider adequate to get a "decent" job. My father could not read or write when he left school and still has problems with both even now. He has worked his arse off all his life and has always payed his taxes. He is a plasterer, which i admit is not the most glamorous of trades, and i started life being quite poor. However, my father always payed his taxes and national insurance and has worked his way up to being the best, and most well payed tradesman in the area.

Since he started life with a lot more misfortune than most, and has still managed to pay his way and provide for his family, why cant everyone else?
