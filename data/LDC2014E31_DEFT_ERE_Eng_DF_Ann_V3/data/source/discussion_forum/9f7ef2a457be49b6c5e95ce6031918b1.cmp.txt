Watching footage of riots in Llahsa, I cannot help but be reminded of race riots else where. Are you sure that Tibetans only want cultural and religious freedom? Or is it cultural and religious purity that they desire? The difference is crucial to the future of Tibetan-Han relations.

Not only race riots. The targets of attack were mainly shops and banks and it may somehow reflect the conflicts between Tibetan traditional society and capitalism / modernization, whatever you call it. It is said that Muslims were also attacked by Tibetan.

I am afraid that example of the Native Americans and the US does not really fit the paradigm.

Is there any movement organised by the Native Americans wanting back the US? There is in Tibet.

Lately the Native Americans have been wanting more Casino revenues, but that's a different story for a different day <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/smiles.gif"/> )

The period difference between the Europeans bringing American under the US Flag and the invasion of Tibet and the Tibetan revolt is totally different. One is ancient with ancient social and morality parameters while the other is contemporary where human rights, sovereignty etc are seriously taken.

Next, someone will bring up the issue of slavery and suggest that the whites, especially the Southerners should atone for their ''sins'' by becoming slaves to the blacks for an equal period of time!

Or, that the Confederates be given their independence since it was a war and the Unionist won it and ''enslaved'' them against their will!!

With due respect, I don't think your example fits the bill.

The point is that Tibet's status as a part of China is the status quo, and has been so for nearly as long as India has been independent. :P

<quote>
Why so?

Because he doesn't want independence?
</quote>

See the status quo comment above. I have more respect for him because he is a realist.

Indeed race riots and more importantly I know what you are pitching at, but that is not race riot. Take it off your chest and state it in plain words and I am sure I can take that on also.
</quote>

It was as much a race riot as the LA Riots and other riots elsewhere. Tibet is a part of China today. Ethnic, cultural and religious purity is untenable, and a riot is not a meeting of minds seeking middle ground.

<quote>
No, it would not be a tragedy.

It is time to put people in their place and rid them of their megalomania and misplaced ambitions!!
</quote>

That's starting to sound a bit megalomaniacal to me. It truly surprises me that you feel this way. That is not how I feel.

<quote>
I understand that all this confusion over Tibet and the Olympic Torch has hurt the Han pride including yours. Very natural and one does not grudge you or other overseas Hans this indulgence.

There is a misconception that people do not like the Chinese. They all like the Chinese. They don't like the attitude of the Red Chinese. Everywhere, China is out to land grab quoting history and conquests that were like video games, on and then off and so on.

Perhaps you could justify this with facts? Historical precedent has always been a justification of territorial claims. All sides in these disputes use them. One of the bedrocks of the CCP's claim to legitimacy is the recovery of territory separated from China during the late Qin period. As far as I'm aware, however, today the PRC position is that territory has largely been recovered, and emphasis is placed on defending existing territory. There are territorial disputes along the Chinese periphery, but the PRC has never attempted to gobble up substantial territory from any of its neighbors.

<quote>
I don't agree.

Violence also can be state generated to fit in its agenda, even though it is a rarity.

And yet muzzling the individual is morally incorrect.
</quote>

My point was that the defense of freedom and rights encompasses the prevention of chaos.

<quote>
No credit to the CCP.

It is to the credit of the Americans destroying the hold of the CCP to some extent with the computer, internet, capitalism and consumerism.
The Chinese have tasted blood.

The CCP's days are numbered!
</quote>

The CCP's policies opened up China to the West and reformed China's economy. Western governments have repeatedly commended the CCP for its actions in this regard, and few fair observers would contest this point.

<quote>
Behind that easy going jollity is a sharp mind at work!!
</quote>

Indeed.

Ahh, Singapore, another bastion of freedom. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/smiles.gif"/>

My feelings toward television in general.

What is wrong in negative news?

It keeps one on its toes even if it is irritating.

I have myself been subject to negative press.
</quote>

Negative news isn't bad. News devoid of context is. At least, it is if one wishes to make informed decisions.

<quote>
I am talking of the Communist Parties of India.

They are traitors!

The US diplomatic corps are traitors?
</quote>

A misunderstanding. I thought you were referring to Chinese influence in India, in which case their display of talent last week warrants some competitive hiring efforts on behalf of the State Department. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/wink.gif"/>
