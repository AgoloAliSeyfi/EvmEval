YOu know why I don't buy what she said. She and Thomas worked at the Department of Education, where he was supposedly a creep. Then he went to EEOC.

Now most people, when they have a boss they hate, they have a little party. They do a little dance. They say a little prayer of thanks to whatever sky pixie they worship. They don't make an effort to get that person back into their lives.

Hill took a transfer to work with Thomas again. Despite the supposed sexual harrassment.

Then she maintained contact with him for a decade, going back to him for letters of recommendation. This is really making a lot of effort to keep someone you hate in your life.

Then lo and behold, he's up for this appointment, and she comes out of the woodwork and says he did this... um... stuff... which really amounted to less obnoxious behavior than I see in my office every day. Which no one else in the office actually said they saw.

You don't have the facts straight, or the background knowledge of the situation.

Most people aren't in Hill's position. Clerking for a federal judge is a very big deal. It was an even bigger deal for a black woman back then. If she pisses Thomas off, it's very easy for him to ruin her career.

As for going back for letters of recommendation, he's the judge that she clerked for. So what does she say when she applies for positions? "I clerked for a federal judge, but don't ask me which one".

Well, the first thing you got wrong here was that she was "Clerking for a federal judge". At the time, Thomas was not a judge, and she was not "clerking".

He was the head of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of education. Then he transferred to the head of the EEOC-and SHE TRANSFERED TO WORK FOR HIM AGAIN. These are both parts of the EXECUTIVE Branch, not the Judiciary. Also at the time, she had passed the bar and was a practicing staff lawyer.

So your facts are completely wrong and you are profoundly ignorant, and apparently too stupid to use Google or Wiki.

Further, she was a Ivy League Law school graduate, a woman and a minority. Big law firms would be tag teaming each other to sign her up, normally. Of course, at a law firm, you'd be required to actually do some work, unlike the government or academia, where "work" is a four letter word.

As for "no one else saw it", do you really think that's a compelling argument? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

Hill didn't come "out of the woodwork". She was about to be subpoenaed, so she came in voluntarily.

Yeah, that is a compelling argument. I know in my office who is sleeping with who, who is gay, who is sucking up to the boss to get that promotion, and so on. And it's like that in every workplace. And I go out of my way to NOT listen to office gossip.

Comparing Thomas to Clinton- there wasn't even a whisper about this kind of stuff before Hill came out of the woodwork. (By they way, she was only supeoned by the Judiciary Committee because Biden's staff scrambled to find any dirt they could on him, and she made an oblique reference that didn't look anything like her eventual testimony. By the time Arlen Spector got through with her, she had no credibility, and Biden had to retreat with his tail betwix his legs.)

On the other hand, we all knew that Clinton was a horndog from day one. I think the main reason he got away with it was that we were all kind of number to six years of this shit.

You are correct, I got some of her bio wrong. Just like you got your claim about her "coming out of the woodwork" wrong. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

But the argument remains-these jobs are not like being a store clerk or a waitress. You can't hide large parts of your biography and not feel the repercussions.

Yeah, that is a compelling argument.

No, it isn't. Others in an office often don't know about a coworker being sexually harassed, because the harasser only harasses in one on one situations.
