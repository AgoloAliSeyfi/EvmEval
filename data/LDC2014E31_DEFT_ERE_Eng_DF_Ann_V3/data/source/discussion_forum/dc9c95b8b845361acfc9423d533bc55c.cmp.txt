This morning I was watching "Good Day New York" on Channel 5, which is part of the FOX network. The co-host were interviewing a guy who is part of the on-going occupation of Wall St., and were (of course) repeating the media standard line by questioning the man as to why there is no set goals or leadership to advocate such goals. During his response, the man pointed out that it's about all types of people pointing out that nothing is being done about the economic inequality and subsequent crimes perpetrated by Wall St./banking giants (individuals and corporations)....and that you had leaders from various backgrounds join in. He stated that Al Sharpton "a self made man from the streets like me" was joining.....at which time co-host Greg Kelly interjected (twice) that like Al Sharpton, Rupert Murdoch is a self made man.

<img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/confused.gif"/> Come again?

Rupert Murdoch INHERITED HIS FATHER'S OWNERSHIP OF TWO NEWSPAPERS IN THE U.K. (Australia). He did NOT start out in the copy room of some local city paper and work his way up to mogul.

Al Sharpton grew up doing the preacher circuit for his particular brand of religion. Big difference.

I saw this as just another Fox flunkie pushing the "class warfare" line that's heard from the neocon/teabagger pundits in the media. By trying to equate Murdoch as a successful "every man", co-host Greg Kelly pushes the subliminal context that the Wall St. protesters are just "jealous" of "successful people".

Typical Fox BS....but not unexpected.

anyone comparing al sharkskin to anything other than an elocutionary murderer on a scale comparable with hitler and all around steaming pile of <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/new/poop.gif"/> should have their head examined, so yea, Fox blew it.

great catch <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/>

And when faced with the painfully obvious bogus and bias methods of the Fox News, willfully ignorant neocon/teabagger toadies like Trajan just bluff and bluster.

I still think it is weird that people who support candidates who preach about small government always want America to turn to God.

Yeah, they want a small, theocratic gov't. that supports only the largest corporations. Gee, why haven't these people relocated to Somalia? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/razz.gif"/>

If you are addressing me, please explain how telling the truth and pointing out lies RE: Fox News and the Wall St. occupation an "obsession"? Unless you can prove me wrong, it would seem that YOU are obsessed with just being contrary to anything I post. Carry on.

I thought you had grown a pair to deal with facts that don't compliment your little darlings at Fox News, Frankie. I guess you still haven't. Carry on.

Your Honor,

I present to you Exhibit A:

<quote orig_author="California Girl">
He inherited 2 regional Australian newspapers from his father. How outrageous! A kid inheriting the family business... albeit a pretty small one.

</quote>

and Exhibit B:

<quote orig_author="Tipsycatlover">
It means that after inheriting two small nondescript newspapers, Murdoch turned those into a media empire and is a self-made mad. The parasitic class at OWS just want everything for nothing. They are having fun at the expense of New York. They get to take drugs, drink, have lots of anonymous sex in the filth they produce and no one can touch them. This is the life!

</quote>

You will note how the subjects both attempt to vaguely push the meme that the newspaper business that the mogul inherited by birth, not from his own hard earned work, are somehow "mom 'n' pop" shops, or in some far away remote 2-bit third-world country, not one of the world nations of the Western Civilization. The goal here, you see, is to pretend that the mogul didn't have much to begin with, just like the regular Joes, and then was able to turn his 2-bit mom'n'pop business into a world media conglomerate...you know, like a good self-made billionaire media mogul.

When the whole world and/or any one with an ounce of common sense knows that the Benefactor started of with a well established powerhouse of a media business in those newspapers he inherited.

Your Honor...I rest my case.
