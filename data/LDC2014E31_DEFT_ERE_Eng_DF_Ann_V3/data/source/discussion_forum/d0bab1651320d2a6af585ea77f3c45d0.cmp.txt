Started work yesterday at 12.30pm, got to the office and gathered the action plan for today. Same procedure for the whole of Haringey excluding High Road N17 (Still closed from Monument Way to Lansdowne Road) Made sure our sub-depots were all deployed and instructed the Tottenham sweepers of the alterations to the daily schedule. Received a call at around 4.30pm from Haringey council instructing me that the Police have finished their forensic sweep of the high road and that they will be "opening" the street for sweepers to start clearing the mess up. I managed to get around 20 sweepers from 2 sub-depots, along with other contractors (Westminster) and a bunch of TFL guy's and all in all we got the high road free of rubble, broken glass, several 1100 bins, bottles, metal railings, gas canisters, two burnt out Police cars and a burnt out Police van and the bus shell by 03.00 this morning.

The amount of damage is unbelievable! The old Carpet Right store on the corner of Lansdowne road is just a shell waiting to topple, along with the Aldi's store and most of the shops along this stretch of the high road.
Funny enough the one shop that appears untouched and is in fact still open and selling is a 24hr corner shop that still has it's watermelons and fruit on stalls outside (you may have seen this shop on the news over the weekend?)

Just received an e-mail this morning that a planned march is taking place tonight in the area! Just hope it doesn't turn into a riot again.

March about what? It is not going to make the IPCC investigation progress any quicker. If the family want a conversation with the police (I read the widow was not ready to speak to anyone the other day), then they can organise that of their own accord through their legal team.

Now if it is a march against the morons who should sooner be back in school in a few weeks, then that is fair enough

Our police must be the laughing stock of the world.They're not armed,they just stand there while scum throw anything from bricks to petrol bombs at them.
Could you imagine any other country using this softly,softly tactic??

Where's the water cannons and rubber bullets??

I thought you were saying it like "all black people like fried chicken". Maybe you're stereotyping rather than being racist.

That is in some places only and I'm not sure how well it is doing. From some Muslims point of view (including mine) it isn't halal because they use mechanical slaughter.

Dixy Chicken is awesome though! <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

bit of a generous review of Dixy <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/tongue.gif"/>

anyway, on BBC London News, they are speaking to some residents who have lost their homes (as they lived in flats above the carpet store) absolutely terrible for them

Is it more of a case of "youth" liking chicken as per Micky Flanagan (at about 2:25)?

Please don't post video clips with language that would not pass the swear filter, thank you

Well it does vary from branch to branch. Most of them around Birmingham are decent but London could be different.

You also have a lot of people just calling themselves Dixy even if they aren't part of the real franchise.

the one nearest to me is alright but all the rest all seem to been intent on selling chicken burgers that are 25% chicket fillet and bread bun and 75% mayo! <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/eek.gif"/>
