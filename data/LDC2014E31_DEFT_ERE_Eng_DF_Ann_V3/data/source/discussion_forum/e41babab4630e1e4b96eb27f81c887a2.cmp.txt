errr, i agree with you there there. Id prefer to say western society.

however understand this. Whilst these western countries have good human rights records in their own home countries they dont have good human rights when they conduct their foreign policies. I mean come on the iraq war was illegal and killed thousands of civilians. The US constantly kills civilians in with drone bombings. The west is also known for (esp the US) for overthrowing foreign regimes. They have a prison called Guantanamo in which most of the inmates have been in prison for years but have never been tried e.c.t and your telling me that these countries respect human rights?

Take a look at these

Valid points. However, America =/= West. Anyway, we shouldn't get hung upon the word 'Westernization'. The idea is of liberation and equality of sexes(big one). I'm sure all this can be done whilst following Islam, as long as people are sensible.

No. All Muslim countries should join in a global khilafah and become more islamic rather than western..

Keep it dumb

Granted i've never been to Pakistan, but personally i think i'd hate to live there and i feel very lucky to be living in the "west". Many muslims on TSR refer to "the west" as this horrible decadent place which offers economic prosperity but nothing in terms of morals or culture. I think they are missing out if they really believe this.

I swear some of you non-Muslims are such hypocrites, you hate it when Muslims attempt to impose their culture onto yours, but at the same time you would love your way of life to be forced onto them..

What are you on about? <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/>

<img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/facepalm.gif" alt=":facepalm:"/> All Castes are Hindu, the vast majority of the INC were Hindu, therefor there was a Hindu majority.

I'm sorry, the man that was voted out of government by a no confidence vote? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/mmm.gif" alt=":mmm:"/>

The INC repeatedly refused to give the Muslims any assurnance of power in government, of course they opposed the Partition because they wanted to rule all of India. I don;t support the actions of the League, but they could have been avoided had the INC not been so inflexible to Muslim fears and demands. Both parties were in the wrong.

And you quote the majority, but that's the whole point. The Hindu majority. The majority that Muslims feared would over-rule and ignore them was....over-ruling and ignoring them. See the problem for them? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/facepalm.gif" alt=":facepalm:"/>

Jinnah suggested a compromise that was accepted, and on October 13 the Muslim League agreed to join the Interim Government. League members took office on October 26, but Jinnah still held back. Pethick-Lawrence invited the leaders to meet in London in December. Jinnah gained some assurances and stayed on to give speeches warning the English that if they did not grant Pakistan, there would be civil war in India. Muslims refused to attend the Constituent Assembly on December 9.

Again the majority of people did not wnat great evil of partition, democracy in action, proportional representation was given, <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/> what next ignore democracy, and will of the people <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/>

Fatherless, motherless, sisterless, brotherless, ethnic cleansing kicked off by the muslim league to fulfill their facsist 2 nation theory, resulting in revenge from some non muslims, all madness
Journalist M. Bourke White, correctly said partition was a massive exercise inhuman misery!!

Let's make this nice and easy for you. All of the castes are.....that's right, Hindu. So despite caste divisions, they have a vast majority, and are likely to follow a HIndu agenda over a Muslim one. Stop arguing this non-point. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/facepalm.gif" alt=":facepalm:"/>

Oh my gosh, this is like talking to a brick wall. The Hindus had a huge majority. Therefor anything which favours the Hindus will have a majority, therefor to the Muslims, a democratic majority means nothing <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/facepalm.gif" alt=":facepalm:"/>

Let us assume a country is 90% Nazi and 10% Jew, would you just wave through any law or legislation based on the fact it's a democratic majority? Now, don't be silly here, I am not equating Muslims or Hindus to Nazis, merely making an analogy.
