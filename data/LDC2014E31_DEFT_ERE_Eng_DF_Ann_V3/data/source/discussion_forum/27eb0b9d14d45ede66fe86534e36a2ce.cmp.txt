And that's a bad thing why?

Westernisation = Progress. Imitating the most developed countries in the world isn't really a bad thing. Pakistan was founded on the basis that Muslims felt their interests would not be guarded by a Hindu government, not as some spiritual Muslim homeland. As it is, I'd hardly say Pakistan is 'Western', what with it's blasphemy laws, it's constant conflict with India, conservative populace, tacit funding and support for various Islamist organisations.

I think rather than worrying about the populace, worry about yourself. Who are you to judge people if they wish to drink alcohol, or watch Western TV?

Also, as you bemoan the West. It's worth remembering you wouldn't have had a country without us <img src="images/smilies/wink.png"/>

Pakistan was created by Britain. Without us Pakistan would have been another province of India. Well, that's difficult to say, without the British in India who knows what would have happened. But my point is, it was Britain that created, or allowed the creation of, Pakistan.

Yes, the conference held by the US DOD and attended by representatives from Bangladesh and Pakistan where the Bangladeshis put the amount of dead at 300,000 was clearly some kind of elaborate ISI conspiracy. The Pakistani figure is near 30,000 by the way not 300,000. The situation in Balochistan and Waziristan is regrettable and I genuinely feel the pain of those living in these areas but it's wrought with complications- not something I expect someone only intent on slandering my country to understand.

You have been completely blown out of the water. You can now argue yourself if you wish <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

Except that the article posted Clearly stated various bangladeshi politicians IN Bangladesh stated the death toll to be in the millions.
And they state as many of the independant political commentators and most of the rest of the worlds on-lookers that pakistan attempted genocide in bangladesh - which India was able to eventually thwart.
But of course pakistanis deny all this so it must be innacurate <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/> sorry but credibility is hardly your strong point.
If india had any real amnimoty toward pakistanis or muslims in general, they had the opportunity to completly bomb most of its cities to oblivion soon after defeating paksitans army - as the Allies did to nazii germany at the end of the war.
But they didnt, they chose to forgive and forget - unfortunatly extremism in pakistan has never left its conciousness even after these sorts of events. I too feel sorry for the Balouchis, who had no problems lviing alongside other indians for a thousand years or so and now are oppressed by fanatics under a pakistani flag.

Yep britain whipped up extremism for years then gave them a home by carving out pakistan allowing it to fester. Probably the only accurate point you have ever made on tsr.

Oh please. Britain did not 'whip up extremism', Britain recognised different religious groups, and encouraged all religious groups to have their own identity. A mistake, but not really 'whipping up extremism'. It's not Britain's fault that once these religious types realised their own identity they felt the need to start killing people and engaing in sectarian violence.

Yes, that's right, systematic rape and the cold blooded torture and murder of around 90,000 people is unavoidable. As is the the killing of perhaps over 10,000 Sikhs by mobs armed to the teeth and supported by the police. Please concentrate on admitting all this and not trying to justify them. Yes there's a cause and effect for everything but unfortunately for you this includes so called Islamic terrorism- note how these acts are irrevocably linked to the persecution of Muslims/ invasions etc.

I have already said the genocide is a massive blot on the face of Pakistan- regardless "millions" weren't killed, estimates by neutral historians are around 300,000 dead. The Pakistani and Bangladeshi authorities obviously give wildly biased figures.

Right, the Barbary pirates were enslaving "kaffirs" because the just-founded USA was invading the Middle East and persecuting Muslims. Idiot.

It always makes me laugh when people suggest there is no pattern between so called Islamic extremism and the oppression of Muslims. I know a Palestinian man at university whose mother was killed during an Israeli airstrike and whose brother was buried alive when their house was bulldozed- now tell me how likely is this man to turn to violence than a Muslim living comfortably in the suburbs of Birmingham? That's a rhetorical question in case you didn't realise that either.

Of course there's a pattern, but it pisses me off when people use some correlative events as exculpatory anecdotes for Islamic uprising.
