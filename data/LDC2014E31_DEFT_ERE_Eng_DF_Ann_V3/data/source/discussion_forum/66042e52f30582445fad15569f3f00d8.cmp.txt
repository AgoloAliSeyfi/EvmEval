This is very disturbing to me.

He was shot 3 times in the forehead at close range, they burned his uniform and diary, the general who filed the false report has refused a subpoena and is now his whereabouts are unknown. The story that a soldier related to Larry King about how he died is now known to be a false. The doctor who performed the autopsy called for an investigation as was denied more than once.

There was a definite coverup that was exposed. And now it appears that there was a second one, that is now being uncovered. We now know that Tillman was planning to come out publicly in opposition to the Iraq invasion. Coincidentally, Bush is withholding evidence claiming executive privelidge.

Now I know I am paranoid, but is there something going on here that we should be concerned about?

Tilman was an athiest and a patriot. The Bush administration smeared his name when he could not defend himself. Absolute shame. -Good man.

We should have monuments for him.

My speculative opinion is that he pissed off another soldier and was murdered by him. Tillman may not have been liked by some of his peers. I wonder how this will pan out.

But I very much doubt there was a conspiracy by the Bush admin.

I haven't heard that - do you have any documentation of that?

Regarding the initial question, it is quite possible that he was murdered - for political reasons, I don't know anything about what they may be, but for personal reasons, maybe. It is also possible that he was hit by accident with a single 3-round burst from an M-16 by a well-trained soldier.

The political reasons seem unlikely to me because lots of soldiers including many much much higher up than him have spoken out. It would not make any sense to murder him for that reason. It would serve no purpose. Yes, I agree that you are paranoid.
