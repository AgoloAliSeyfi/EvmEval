oh ive had this too!!, when i was in high school, i had to catch the college bus, so everyone would get off and then id be alone on the bus for another 5 minutes till i got to school. I was in year 9 at the time.
There was this one driver, he seemed nice enough, used to say hello when i got on and ''have a nice day'' when i got off... then he started to get creepy, asking me questions like whats my name, how old was i, and did i have a boyfriend?? The worse was when he asked me again if i had a boyfriend, and when i said no, he said ''oh well a pretty girl like you should have a boyfriend!'' i was like =O..''i have to go to lesson now!'' and ran off the bus. The worse thing was he had control over the doors, so he could have not opened them and he knew where i lived as i got on the bus outside my house!!!
He'd stare at me when i go off the bus too, like he'd wait till i went round the corner before he drove off... <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/> Ive had the same with old guys as well, like they sit next to me in the street and start saying stuff like ''you live around here, your a pretty girl, id like there to have been more girls like you at college when i was there'' then smile all pervertedly... :/

oh and a few months ago, ( i was 17) some guy outside sainsburys about mid 30s stopped me and asked for my number and that i should go round his for a few drinks and stay round as hes only just moved here.. O_O And then he followed me back into town so i ran away and hid in a shop... :/

Yeah. My old school is quite a well known known one in my town. It has a very distincitive green uniform. Some old pervy guy one asked me if I was wearing green knickers. It wasn't a games afternoon, so I wasn't.

A trick could be to wear earphones, but to not have them plugged in to anything and have the jack in your pocket. That might act as a social deterrent to people as they think you'll be listening to music!

I was in London the other week, sat with 2 friends and this guy came up to me and said that he really liked my hair - which wouldn't have been weird except that my hair is nothing special. Then he said it was probably how I was positioned under this arch with my friends next to me - who he called my bodyguards... And then he asked for my name and tried to shake my hand.

Then an hour later he came back and starting asking me if I liked French music and showed me a youtube video on his phone. We left after that <img src="images/smilies/tongue.png"/>

This type of attention I get from men prevents me from wearing the clothes I want during the summer, like denim hotpants and skirts and dresses. <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/>

What's wrong with someone asking how are you? Shet, we live in such a closed, un-social and fear-filled world these days <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/>

Can't say that has happened to me lol, but last night I was stuck in a curry house waiting for my takeaway whilst my french teacher (I wasn't the most compliant student) was there with her husband.

Anyway apparently this works?

Spoiler:

Although some of these incidents may not seem serious, it can be terrifying and humiliating to be approached by a man in this way and feel powerless to do anything about it.

Glad you posted that <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.png"/> you beat me to it!

OP, I started a thread about street harassment a little while back. There's also a link to the London hollaback site on there. Feel free to have a read <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>
