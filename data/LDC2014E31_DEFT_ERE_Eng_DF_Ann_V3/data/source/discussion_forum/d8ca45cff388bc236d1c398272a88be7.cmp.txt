I doubt Israel will get destructed, they have a formidable military. Israel will have a harder time, and their economy will be strained if there ever is a full on war with Iran.

Sustainability of Israel is determined by it's economy and allegiance and loyalty of Israelis to live in Israel and serve in the army. Both of these would be severely damaged with any full scale confrontation with Iran (with use of nuclear weapons by Israel pretty much sealing Israel's fate). The issue of Gilad Shalit has demonstrated a weakness in the Israeli psyche with regard to it's military.

Probably, but it could drag the US and Israel down with it. Britain and France won the wars in WWI and WWII, but the experience dragged them down from the top dogs of the world, to be replaced by the US. The same would happen, with China probably being the most to benefit.

The logistics was actually pretty good, by the end of December 2001, the United States and the ISAF controlled Kabul and the surrounding areas. You're confusing Afghanistan with being a conventional warfare and the objective of the mission. The mission in Afghanistan is not conventional occupation with the process of eliminating Afghan military capacity and sovereignty. Afghanistan war is essentially a counter-insurgency mission, aimed at cutting the supply and harvesting of al-Qaeda training camps provided by the Taliban, suppressing Taliban strength and re-training Afghan security to eliminate any further significant Taliban influence. Conventionally, Afghanistan was done and dusted, but the process of combating guerilla warfare is another issue and isn't necessarily applicable to Iran.

The occupation of Iraq didn't have logistical issues (only in respect to the UK and the Osprey body armour issues in the early stages of the war). The conventional warfare lasted from March to May 2003, which is a reasonably fast conflict considering the United States is 7,000 miles away. The main thing that attributed to the difficulties was the guerilla warfare by Iraqi nationalists and the failure of the coalition to recognize cultural tensions, notably the Shiite/Sunni tensions in particular in the triangle of death. The majority of the Iraq war consisted of the reconstruction of Iraqi political institutions and providing training and expertise to Iraq.

I agree that financially, they maybe stretched in their budget to fight another war but in terms of toe-to-toe strength, a conventional war with Iran would end in a slaughter of Iran. Military intelligence has a very good idea of the military effectiveness of Iran since the US sold F-15s and the like up until 1979 which they still use today with Soviet technology being the forefront of their ground campaign. With the expertise of the US military top brass, superior fire-power and myriad of strategic options, the US are still able to have an occupation of Iran, it would just be better not to.

for the sake of occupation, they could attempt it, but its not something the would be able to sustain and acheive their objectivess (just as shown in iraq and afghanistan).... american cannot afford (financially and economically) to be fighting wars on multiple fronts. American cannot and will not undertake a land invasion/attack of iran. It will be limited to "strategic" strikes on nuclear facilites/other sites of concern.
