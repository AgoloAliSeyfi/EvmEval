One thing I think I've read is that we tend to actually remember the last telling, or proecessing, of a memory.

I've been asking the sozlet if she remembers when she was in my tummy since she was tiny, and she's told me things, but who knows. When she was maybe 16 months old she said it was "red" and "hot". (Signing.) Recently she said she remembered pushing with her feet and feeling squooshed.

That's interesting soz. Makes you wonder if she really can remember being born. Sounds like an idea that should be explored scientifically.

I think my earliest memory was somewhere between 3 and 4 years old.

In VERY vivid detail I remember falling down the first flight of stairs in my house onto the landing in front of the main door. The funny thing is, I don't remember what caused me to fall.

I just remember tumbling down. I kept my eyes open, and clearly watched the view go from the handrail, to stairs, to cieling, then wall, then finally to ceiling.

I stayed on the floor for a few moments, looking up at the cieling, no tears ( as I wasn't really hurt, just surprised, and no one was near me, so drama would have been pointless <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"/>, and thats where the memory ends.

my memories
I think I may have a terrible memory because the earliest I can remember is around the time I was in Kindergarten. Anything before that seems to be lost in time. Although I can remmeber walking through a neighbors house and it was filled with exotic birds. The woman who lived there was very accentric and odd. I know my mother despised the sloppiness of the old woman. I however cannot remmeber what time period it was in. I may have been three or i may have been 5, i'll never know. But it seems as if I have an inferior longterm memory compared to most people. I can remember the oddest things but major events totally slip my mind. I remember slugs on the porch and a batman birthday party. But not anything about the move. Maybe I am prone to having a bad memory, what do you think?

I can remember having a dream when I was three, My dad, and sister were riding bike, and I was in on of those old bike carriers, we stopped at this cliff where a big brown ape man picked us up and took us to his cave, then I woke up. I don't know why that stuck!

I can also remember watching Mr. Dressup and all those shows while eating a bag of dry cereal. I always had dry cereal...lol

Also when I was three, I used to use pillow cases as sleeping bags...hehe...and I used to suck on my big toes...ewww....lol

There's only one early memory I can absolutely date. I was 27 months old, and it was the summer of 1958. We flew from Seattle to Upstate New York to visit my grandmother and a raft of uncles and aunts, and then drove back. I remember being absolutely terrified on the flight, but kept deathly still. I just knew that something horrible would happen if I made a peep. But after the flight landed I howled to high heavens. Then, weeks later, we drove back in a car without AC. We were on a highway paralleling a river (must have been either in North Dakota or eastern Montana) and we were all ready to melt. We came across a stand, north of the road and closer to the river, selling iced watermellon in the shade of big trees. We stopped, ate a bunch of watermellon, and cooled off before continuing the drive.

There are a few other early memories, but I can't date them.

I remember my mother rocking me, trying to get me to fall asleep, while singing the Brahm's Lullaby to me. She thought she had succeeded, but I was still wide awake, though with my eyes closed. She stopped singing and rocking, thinking to put me to bed/crib(?), but the instant she did my eyes went wide open, and I demanded "la la!".

A final memory. I don't know how old I was, but I do remember I couldn't talk yet. I was sitting in a high chair, and my sister (seven years my senior) walked by. As she did I very deliberately grabbed as much of her hair as I could, and yanked. She screamed, and said I did it on purpose (of course I did). But our parents said "oh no, it was an accident".

My earliest memory is being in preschool, 2 years old, and knowing how to read, since I learned pretty early. The teacher was a bit surprised. That made for an awkward time in my first year of preschool, I believe.

It was a while before my parents even knew that I could read.

So, who taught you how to read?

TV, seriously. Sesame Street.

EDIT: Rather, Sesame Street is what taught me how to read.

Coulda been worse. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"/>

My first TV memory was Dodo The Kid from Outer Space (B&amp;W).

Given that I'm a sci-fi fan, and love science, I wonder if that early TV show set the course for my life... I'll never know.
