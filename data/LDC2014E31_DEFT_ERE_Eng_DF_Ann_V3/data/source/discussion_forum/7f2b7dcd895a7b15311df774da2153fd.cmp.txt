I know I shouldn't, but in a strange way I feel slightly sorry for Rebekah - she certainly has a lot to answer for and should be punished for that, but she doesn't deserve to be treated as a human shield by the Murdochs after her (ill-advised) loyalty to them.

This is all my opinion of course, and will probably change - my opinions don't usually count for anything anyway! <img src="images/smilies/tongue.png"/>

Her loyalty was partly due to the fact that she is just as cold-blooded, uncaring, cynical and calculating as the Murdochs are. She's a deeply unpleasant person and deserves what she's got coming to her.

Likewise, however, that's just my opinion.

To be honest, I think you've hit the nail on the head there. For some reason which I can't understand I want to defend her, but when I read more and more into her personality, I realise what an unpleasant person she really is: <a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/07/08/gay-mp-chris-bryant-claims-ni-boss-rebekah-brooks-sneered-at-his-sexuality/">just one example</a>.

I've heard this rumour in various other places too. IMO, if she wanted to resign buy has not been allowed to, why is all the vitriol directed at her being still in a job?

He said she had a good 'work ethic' apparently I've posted a link to the story. It doesn't look like she'll be going anywhere, I've heard quite a few people saying that they believe all newspapers do this and that the NOTW have just been caught at it wonder if there is any truth in that at all?

Yea I love the Metro newspaper especially online because it never sounds like a newspaper online it sounds like actual people (if that makes sense) and there are some hilarious stories in there (and of course more serious ones)

If you want to know how much truth there is in it have a look at the Information Commissioner's report <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/~/media/documents/library/Corporate/Research_and_reports/what_price_privacy_now_report.ashx">What Price Privacy Now?</a> One interesting little snippit is that, up to the end of 2006, their investigations had found 182 transactions on behalf of the News of the World that breached s55 of the Data Protection Act. They also found that pretty much all the newspapers were carrying out these transactions (Daily Mirror:681 so it's not just the Murdochs) and that the Daily Mail had carried out 952 of them.

So, yeah, they're all at it. And don't kid yourself that they've all stopped doing it just because the NotW has closed.

That's the sad part about it. They could put the extra effort into finding their information legally but no, any extra effort they put in will go on avoiding the law not complying with it.

there was a Telegraph blog about Grant, to the same effect of what I said, can't find it now though.

It was by Brendan "Murdoch's Human Toilet Roll" O'Neill.

Though Brendan has to wait in line for toilet roll duties with Christina Odone, Toby Young and all the other hacks with an eye for a future career as a Murdoch minion.
