1) Of course not, they haven't made them yet. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rofl.gif" alt=":rofl:"/>

So on what basis will you attack Iran? That they MAY acquire nuclear weapons. That is so ****ing silly.

If the UK were planning to abolish murder as a criminal charge in a few years time, could I go out and murder 100 people based on the intention, "Well, it's going to be abolished anyway".

<quote>
2) I beg to differ. It has repeatedly refused to declare several sites and when they were caught out they said they were going to declare them anyway.
</quote>

Evidence?

3) As I said before here you are, making a pipsqueak about it and you only have to have an open mind to know that America's being hypocritical.
</quote>

I Know America AND ISRAEL are being hypocritical. Yet no one is telling them that.

<quote>
<img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rofl.gif" alt=":rofl:"/> First of all to put it into context Israel didn't threaten Iran. It's been the warmongering on the mullahs' part after they decided they wanted Israel destroyed for some obscure reason because their ideology advocated it. Iran is not an Arab country, the Israel-Arab conflict has absolutely nothing to do with Iran. The mullahs have no right funding proxies there because they are getting involved in something that has nothing to do with them. The mullahs themselves see the Arabs as more of an enemy than Israel so this comparison is idiotic as there will never, ever be unity in the Middle East amongst Muslims and I hope there never is either.
</quote>

(1) Yet for 30 years, they didn't do anything. In fact, Iran has never even waged war against Iran which cannot be said for it's neighboring countries.

<quote>
A very optimistic view. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/lol.gif" alt=":lol:"/> China and Russia don't want the US to throw its weight around so they're using their veto as a feeble show of strength. By vetoing the criticism of Assad's actions they want to show that they will not just follow America's lead on this one.
</quote>

(1) Feeble: America's looking feeble. They can't intervene and save their beloved "democracies in action" because of Russia/China. There used to be a time when Americans would say "**** the world, we are doing this".

<quote>
Defending itself against what? Hezbollah was created by Iran and Khomeini decided to send Revolutionary Guards there to train militants as a 'resistance' group. They don't seem to be doing much resisting by constantly firing rockets into Israel are they? That's a whole different argument and frankly, this has nothing to do with it. As I said before the mullahs have no right to poke their nose into the Arab-Israel conflict so whether Hezbollah attacked first or otherwise, it doesn't justify their actions.
</quote>

The Afghan security force was created by the US and the coalition. Yet when they attack the people who they are "helping", they are labelled terrorists.

On the same scale, America has no RIGHT to poke it's nose at the Arab/Israel conflict if Iran hasn't got the same right. Why are there different rules for one country and different rules for other countries?

Well it's obvious they'll say that but it's obvious they're after a bomb. It's so they can throw their weight around without fear of reprisal from America or Israel, not for use. They shouldn't be allowed nukes, period. As for an invasion, definitely not.

</quote>

why is israel allowed nukes though. Okay Iran should not have Nuclear weapons but Israel has no right to say it,

Its like a thief telling other people not to thieve because its illegal

The same way I saw the US invading Pakistan instead of Afghanistan even though Pakistan have nukes.

</quote>

Because Pakistan largely follows American orders. The US assisted them in developing nukes in the first place.

<quote>
As I said before Iran initiated it...
</quote>

How?

<quote>
For example? The Shah seemed pretty content with staying out of it.
</quote>

The Shah's absolutism was a knock-on effect. Mossadegh was going forward with social-democratic nationalism that had been popularised by Nasser and Arab leaders, and this led to the 1953 coup.

<quote>
Where did I say that?
</quote>

Note it was a question.

<quote>
Why do you keep jumping to conclusions. How did me explaining the reason for China and Russia's veto somehow make me an American lover. Bishy said that 'we'd see more positive results from China and Russia' and I implied that the Chinese and Russians hold no sympathy for the Syrian people rather they want to maintain their control and not have the US throw its weight around.
</quote>

The way OP is written makes it a good guess you'd be backing US-Israel because you seemed to be agreeing with the proposed intervention by them, but fair enough if you're not.

Though based on what you're criticising Iran for, it should be quite a bit down on your priority list.

<quote>
No. I was just mentioning the Iran bit... Why does the US and Israel having favoured factions justify Iran to do the same.
</quote>

It doesn't justify it, but it puts their actions into context. On the same logic, being hit by someone doesn't justify hitting them, but it makes why you do (if you do) understandable.
