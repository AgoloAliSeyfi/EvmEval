Kit, nothing is impossible, just unlikely.

Sure thing. But you seeing a 10 x 6 ft Bigfoot in that little corridor of woods along the Pasquotank isn't any better than me claiming to see a Reptoid in the park while playing tennis today.

I don't need a hypothetical, but feel free if you want. If we are going to do that, I would prefer that we talk about ideas on research. Such as IF this animal is real, what techniques the people here would use to search for it. Even if we need to start a new thread. I want new ideas.

Are you asking why I waited 16 years to report it? Because I had no idea who to report it to until the internet age.

I am helping you. I don't think that all the Bigfoot enthusiasts across North America out there searching for Bigfoot don't find it because it's not there. That's exactly what the evidence shows.

John, I gave you the number for wildlife and environmental experts for the Great Dismal Swamp. How likely is it that you'll actually contact these people. This is a black and white zoological issue and those people need to know that the biggest primate on Earth eats mulberry leaves in their area. This is huge. Like, the biggest thing ever. Forget the yeehaws farting around in Salt Fork, these people have got to be told and I think your just the spokesperson to do it. What do you say? Will your fingers do the walking and your mouth do the talking?

I was lucky to see a Bald Eagle in flight in Yakima. I would like to see more.

The Bigfoot I saw keeps getting larger and larger.

Kit thanks for the phone number, but who said I did not already have that phone number. I have called the Dismal park before to ask about park rules because my local group wanted to inquire about a possible outing. During the summer the swamp can be a dangerous place because of the abundance of bears, water moccasins and copper heads. They even close the park completely at night. I feel it is better to speak about such things to rangers in person.

During another investigation my group has spoken to the rangers about Bigfoot at another park here in Virginia called Prince William Forrest. The ranger even produced log books and let us thumb through them to read the Bigfoot reports they receive. Surprised that they log the reports Kit?

Please remember that even though I am the world's greatest Bigfoot hunter <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/> I still need to work to feed my family. My job has been extremely busy and I am working long hours at this time. What little spare time I have has been spent on a investigation in progress for my local "Bigfoot enthusiast group" <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/> or taking care of my own personal issues.

Those things are like chickens where I am.

Thanks for the clarification. I think Chris handled himself very well when he was on Monster Quest. It's not easy to not look a little kooky when you're talking about Bigfoot in New York. Though ex-NESRA Steve Kulls was not able to do that, Chris Bartow was (3:30)...

regarding Monsterquest: bear in mind they butchered the actual timeline of events, and whilest we were there to do what we do, they had the agenda of doing a historical overview of the Adirondak area rather than focus on us, also I would agree that Kulls hogged the camera.

as far as BF in New York there actually is a history of alledged activity in the area going back a few hundred years but thats a whole different can of worms.
