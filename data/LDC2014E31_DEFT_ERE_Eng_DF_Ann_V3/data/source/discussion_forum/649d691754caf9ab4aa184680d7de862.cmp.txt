Well I do know some MLS fans and some that have previously lived in England too. And I trust their opinion that MLS is roughly the same level as the Championship. And looking through the players that play in MLS I agree with what they say.

And you are quite wrong pressure wise, he has FAR more to live up to in the U.S than he would if he moved for example to Bolton or Fulham etc. Surely you can see that? As for you comments about him going there to promote U.S football over here? I am sure you mean to promote MLS in the states, not here, a very hard task indeed.

And to slate him for being injured? Im sorry but your being a little harsh here, at the same time as not apparently knowing much about MLS in its current state.

Whatever. I would rather trust peoples views who work in the game, follow World football through their work, and know US football inside out thanks. You can stick with 'my mates views'. <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/wink.gif"/> I'm sure they know much more than the people who supply US soccer with it's kit's, medals, and have links with the US FA.

I am quite wrong? If you say so. Far more to live up to how? He has gone to the US for his swansong, something he would never be able to do in the English PL. The US fans are demanding, but so are English fans, and the game has far less meaning than in Europe. Talking of 'not seeing' there was a protest at LA about Beckhams inability to string more than two appearances together. Did you see how little effect that had. Whereas, when he was at Madrid, and he wasn't playing he admitted that it was really getting to him. As for less pressure at smaller PL clubs, are you for real?! What's going to give out more grief, the English press and the fans at one of the middle ranking clubs or LA Galaxy's fans and a US sports media who couldn't give a toss? Well, try asking some of the foreign players who admit they find it hard to cope with at those 'small' PL clubs. Bear in mind as well, that even the top MLS clubs would struggle to beat the average attendance of even the PL's minnows.

No I mean to promote the MSL here. Or haven't you noticed what's been going on recently? You know, the dedicated Beckham/US soccer proggys, the US investors trying to drive the US soccers profile up?

Being a little harsh? Beckham by his own admission said he played very few games in first season due to Injury. If that's not enough of an indictment then what the hell is? <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/>

Please, keep the schoolboy insults to your yourself.

In particular as your opinions are riddled with Skyisms, not facts. <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

Schoolboy insults? We just happen to have a difference of opinion.

MLS is only getting on the news etc here because of Beckham, and thats down to the British media. His main promotional reason for being there is to promote the MLS in the country it is in. There is little to no point in 'promoting' the MLS here as we already have the most financially successful league in the world.

As for more to live up to, while in England the footballing public and press know Beckham and his limitations etc, people in the states as a general rule do not. He has been hyped to death out there, the media in America are just waiting to pounce on him failing.

PS. I dont even have Sky.
