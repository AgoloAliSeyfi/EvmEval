INC can only have power with votes that clearly took place, or are you denying the demnocratic process <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/> dear me!!
Next there are caste divisions so how can there be a hindu majority <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/>

Briatin took India back to time of King Asokas empire when India did exist -basic fact <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/>

Hold on we are talking about Muslim league party and not all Muslims voted for them, Allah Baksh regionall leader of Sind provicne shot dead by league hitmen in 1943 to shut his anti partition plan up, Bacha Khan, -NWPF, where League lost 1946Provincial elections.
Now there was secretarian violence but not to level of partition times, you need to check Noakhali 1920s, then Direct Action day where Hindus were tageted and Butchered, so you agree with killings of innocent humanbeings as a result of direct action day, yes Hindus did respond in other areas again against innocent human beings of Muslim faith.

Shocking clear democratic process was subverted <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/>, but u ignore that dont you!!

INC was part of cause as they surrendered to violence of the League, against the democratic wishes of the majority who wanted to live as before. USA model could have agreed with weak central govtn with strong regional state giving more power to regional areas, partition was the very last this INC wanted, but they capitulated

What are you on about? <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/>

<img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/facepalm.gif" alt=":facepalm:"/> All Castes are Hindu, the vast majority of the INC were Hindu, therefor there was a Hindu majority.

I'm sorry, the man that was voted out of government by a no confidence vote? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/mmm.gif" alt=":mmm:"/>

The INC repeatedly refused to give the Muslims any assurnance of power in government, of course they opposed the Partition because they wanted to rule all of India. I don;t support the actions of the League, but they could have been avoided had the INC not been so inflexible to Muslim fears and demands. Both parties were in the wrong.

And you quote the majority, but that's the whole point. The Hindu majority. The majority that Muslims feared would over-rule and ignore them was....over-ruling and ignoring them. See the problem for them? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/facepalm.gif" alt=":facepalm:"/>

Pakistan wasn't intended to be a secular country. Its constitution states:

Article 2a: Islam will be the state religion
Article 227: No laws will be passed which are repugnant to the Qur'an and Sunnah.

Taken from 1973 constitution, proposed by the Bhutto government, surely? It hardly reflects Jinnah's views. Bhutto gave in to Mullahs' pressure and not to forget that he was the one who declared Ahmadis non-Muslim s.

<quote>
First of all, Jinnah wasn't the intellectual founder of Pakistan, and nor was he the sole writer of the constitution. Secondly, it is believed that Jinnah became religious and converted to mainstream Sunni Islam some time before his death, probably during the post-independence period. This is pretty much necessitated by the fact that we know that a lot of Deobandi Sunni Shaykhs were very close to him before and after partition, and is confirmed by the fact that he had a Sunni burial. After that conversion to Sunni Islam it is understood that he became far more religiously observant. Whether he used to drink before that or not, I don't know (although one of his biographers claims so), but after the foundation of Pakistan he is not believed to have been a drinker of alcohol. Further to this, it is difficult to see the extent to which his religious observance affected his religious beliefs. He clearly supported the idea of Pakistan after having been convinced of it by Muhammad Iqbal, the one who formalised the two nation theory, on the grounds that the Muslims of India (as we can now see in hindsight) would suffer a lot.

Furthermore, the habits of one man hold no sway over the constitution of Pakistan, which was undeniably an Islamic one and not secular. On the other hand, later 'secular' Bills have contravened the constitution, interestingly enough.

Just sayin'.

I have no desire to discuss Jinnah's motives, because proponents of Islamic state and secular state cherry-pick isolated quotes from Jinnah to support their arguments. e.g. for a secularist argument I could use this quote:

“You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place of worship in this State of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion or caste or creed that has nothing to do with the business of the State”

Actions speak louder than words, Jinnah didn't give a toss about Muslims - he was definitely not an observant Muslim. He like any other politician used religious rhetoric to achieve his own political ambition. Also, Deobandis were not even in favour of a separate state, they completely distrusted Muslim league.

I don't know whether Jinnah converted to Sunni Islam or not. It's a futile discussion and depends on mere <a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/may/09jinnah.htm"> speculation and hearsay</a>.

What matters is what Pakistani people want and no Islamic party has ever been voted in Government by the people of Pakistan, which speaks volumes.
