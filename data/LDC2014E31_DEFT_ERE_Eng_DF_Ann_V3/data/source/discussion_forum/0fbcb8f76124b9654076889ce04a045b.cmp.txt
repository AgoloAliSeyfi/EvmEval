I've been thinking about public education in this country a lot recently. I read a lot of stuff about my generation eschewing suburban life in favor of living in cities, but I wonder what will happen when my peers have school-age children. I really want to live in the city, but the public schools here seem like a nightmare to navigate, and there are generally no private schools in the city that we find appealing.
This post was spurred by this NPR article I read this morning: <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/02/18/147067123/kansas-citys-failed-schools-leave-students-behind">Kansas City's Failed Schools Leave Students Behind</a>. Key quotes:
On Jan. 1, the Missouri state school board revoked the Kansas City district's accreditation. The district met just three of the 14 standards established by the state, falling short of minimum proficiency standards for math, English and science, as well as attendance and graduation rates.
I thought this part seemed to really highlight the issues:
Southwest High School has a roster of famous alumni, including Calvin Trillin and the founders of H&amp;R Block. The district built a planetarium for this school, but those middle-class families wanted better test scores, not bright stars. The school district continued to shrink, from about 77,000 students in the 1960s to fewer than 16,000 today.
To reduce costs last year, the district closed almost half the schools in the city. Now boarded-up schools sit in almost every neighborhood like dead brick dinosaurs.
Some schools, like Southwest High, were merged, raising enrollment dramatically, maybe even dangerously. Southwest swelled from 500 students to 1,800 "with no real plan," Wiedeman says. "It was bound to explode."
So then there's the discussion of vouchers (putting aside that my peer group of affluent professionals is unlikely to qualify for need-based vouchers and will likely be deciding between suburban public schools or paying for private school). I understand the theory behind vouchers - competition will force the public schools to improve. But from what I'm seeing, the data does not support that hypothesis.
This <a href="http://www.epi.org/publication/book_vouchers/">study from the Economic Policy Institute</a> found that public schools in Milwaukee generally saw no improvement from the competition introduced by vouchers. (Note: I've read the Executive Summary but haven't had a chance to read the full study or evaluate the methodology used.) This <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/education/118820339.html">2011 article from the Journal Sentinel</a> cites data finding that students who participate in the voucher program did not perform better than their public school peers. So at least based on the available data, it appears that voucher programs are neither improving the performance of program participants nor improving the quality of the public school systems. This makes me question what the point of the programs is at all.
I wish I could leave my lawyering life and go study education and education policy. I'm really rather despondent about the state of urban public education, and it seems like nobody really has any idea how to fix it. If you have any other articles or studies to add to what I've posted, please do. I really encourage you to read the ones I've posted. This is fascinating, frustrating stuff.

I will say that I have never found an article on the Milwaukee voucher program that proves it's working. Which is fairly damning, since it's one of the longest running programs in the country.
Beyond that, most of the research I'm privy to (via my sister) is actually based in the private education sector. So I'm not much help.

The problem is not rising and falling enrollment, that's just normal demographics. In fact, lately in my country they've been building schools modularly so they can be turned into house when the families with young kids in the neighbourhood grow older and don't need them anymore.

The problem is that funding of schools is so small and varied. They need to be funded and organised on a state-wide basis, these tiny school districts make no sense.

A friend of mine is very involved in conservative politics and one day sent a bunch of pro-voucher tweets about how parents know what's best, competition is good, choices improve outcomes, etc. So I responded, asking if this is true, why has MPS not improved drastically in the last decade? I got no response. I was super frustrated.
I have all kinds of reservations about voucher programs, but if someone could show me that they actually worked - that voucher participant performance improved and that affected public schools' performance improved - I could probably get past my reservations. At this point, I just want something that works!

Vouchers don't improve schools they just provide another alternative for a limited number of students. The schools are then left with less students, which means less funding, which means less counselors and enrichment programs. How does a school improve under those circumstances? The reality is it is not anyone's focus to actually improve the schools. Rather than admitting the program doesn't work, politicians spend their time perpetuating the myth that the kids left in the school deserve a failing school because they or their parents don't care about education. That those particular kids are beyond help.
