MK Ultra is not a conspiracy theory. It features in a lot of them, but it, by itself is not one. I wouldn't even call it a conspiracy because that has connatations of criminal enterprise (I don't conspire with others to take a trip to Mount Rushmore but I do to rob a bank). It was covert(a lot of things are) but if they were dosing people without their knowledge, it's wrong. But Ken Kesey and Robert Hunter were volunteers in the program as were many others.

Sirhan Sirhan is the murderer of Robert Kennedy, right? But if you were to say Sirhan Sirhan was an MkUltra mind controlled assassin then that would be a conspiracy theory.

How is it not a conspiracy theory? Massive government program experimenting on people, sometimes with their consent though maybe not informed consent, but not always. People taken without their consent to be given drugs and even torture such as extreme pain and sleep deprivation in order to have subjects to study how effective brain washing can be, and this goes on for at least 20 years; people saying it's going on and are mocked; the CIA destroys most documents when caught though enough evidence is out there to prove the claims I mentioned.....I mean we're talking anywhere from tens of thousands of victims to who knows? This spanned both democratic and republican administrations.

It has all the characteristics of a conspiracy theory and it was true.

A post-facto cover up. These experiments were not known about until 2010 by the public. So there was a cover up.

</quote>
There is quite a difference between "not known by the public" and being secret. Likewise, there is quite a difference between your imagining (whole cloth) a cover-up and there actually being one. Finally, no scapegoat or ninjas - just unauthorized medical experiments (IIRC, they lied to the subjects about what they were injecting).

Someone is not getting the idea. Lack of informed consent and keeping bio-medical "research" secret =/= the level of complexity for a CT 9/11 or Moon Landing hoax. Scapegoats, ninjas, etc...

Another famous conspiracy theory dismissed by liberals and progressives at the time as just a conspiracy theory were Stalin's killing and starving of millions of people in the 30s. Liberals and progressives including one Pulitzer prize winning journalist at the NYTs all derided the claims despite millions of people dying. More pointedly, many did it knowingly as records show they knew in their private conversations what Stalin was doing and yet covered it up.

</quote>
Scapegoats? Ninjas? Need for anything more elaborate than guns and herding people around while denying it to the outside world?

<quote>
We're talking millions of people dying and at least a million involved in the conspiracy and yet it was true. Stalin starved and killed millions in the Ukraine as just one example, and it was derided as a conspiracy theory by the libs at the time.

</quote>
And was a well known fact to other millions who survived the event. No secret cabal or Illuminati.

<quote>
In the 60s, when Christians came out and told of horrible torture by the Soviets to try to "reeducate" them and force them to recant their faith, the lib media derided that as well.

</quote>
More than anything I'm getting the feeling your interests lie in a specific political direction.

<quote>
Sometimes, the torturers would be saved by witnessing the grace on those they tortured and they too would then be tortured.

</quote>
OK, now we are venturing off into fringe territory. One government torturing its citizens and denying it, no scapegoats, no ninjas, no Illuminati.

<quote>
Conspiracies are a very common aspect of history. Anyone denying that is just ignorant of history.

See, now you're just being rude.

If the Lockerbie case is just another run-of-the-mill miscarriage of justice where the cops fitted up the wrong guy, just like the Meredith Kercher murder and so many others, why the concerted campaign to have every mention of this moved to Conspiracy Theories?

</quote>
I find this quite a worrying question, that demonstrates just how easily someone perfectly rational, and with a reasonable position to argue, can fall into habits of conspiracist thinking. It's a classic conspiracist argument to say "Well, if you didn't think it was a conspiracy, you wouldn't bother arguing against it," and the suggestion that there's a "concerted campaign" is itself almost a conspiracy theory. Rolfe, you've made a very good case, repeatedly and thoroughly, for the claim that al-Megrahi's conviction was at the very least unsound; don't go off the rails just because most people can't raise the interest to follow it, and would rather it all just went away.
