How tragic.....no cause yet but I'll bet it is a drug overdose..

IMO, one of the best singers of all time

TC I too believe it will be drug related, which is sad because she was so talented.

Drugs in this country are robbing us of some of the most brilliant and talented people. Whitney's voice will go on, and we fortunately can keep listening to her. Sad for her daughter, who now has no mother.

Hope Whitney finds the peace that eluded her on earth.

So sad to hear about her death...too young to die.
However, part of me was not surprised when I heard the terrible news.. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/sad.gif" alt=":("/>..
In April of 2010 she appeared on stage in my home town in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, England.
My sister, a long time fan of Whitney spent half her weekly pay-check on a front row seat, and she told me the show was a disaster..
Sadly, Whitney appeared on stage disoriented, disheveled, and forgot the words to three or four of her songs.
The show manager finally decided to stop the performance after Whitney left the stage twenty minutes into the show, and didn't return.
That was almost two years ago, and I had hoped she would try for another come-back, but it was not to be.

RIP.

Such an unhappy person..So many emotional problems. She just did not have the strength to fight back.

I wish she had been able to have a happier life. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/cry.gif" alt=":_|"/>

Sad, but not a big surprise.

She did have a lovely voice and we are lucky to have that voice recorded.

By all accounts, though, she had lost her ability to sing. Maybe she just did not have the heart for it anymore.

They should auction off her favorite crack pipe here on eBay, and donate the proceeds to charity.

She was an awesome singer some 15 odd years ago. It's a shame her weakness eventually lead to her demise.

I read about her in People magazine. Saw the funeral service in the church she sang in growing up. What a terrible loss for the world, and how painful for her family, especially her daughter Bobbi Kristina ("Krissy"), her mother and her cousin Dionne Warwick. The service was beautiful. If I were offered all the money in the world to be famous, I'd turn it down. Fame ain't all that.

Sad, yes...but another celebrity death that just makes you shake your head. She's been circling the drain for years. (No pun intended! <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/sad.gif" alt=":("/> )
