The only reason it is bad math, is because it is done with the insurance industry and a gift horse of tax dollars to them, and because it is NOT a hostile take over of the industry, a Universal, single payer plan.imho <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

I don't support the stepping stone to Totalitarian Health Care, where the privileged get favors and we get screwed. It's bad math because there is abuse in the equation, that does remain and will continue to remain embedded. You are not addressing the symptoms, but justifying them through ignorance. Not your fault, they are well fortified and entrenched. Until we address the cost of service from the value perspective and break it down, we will continue to be sheared. It is wrong to think Government has no place with the muggers.

intense, are you saying the problem lies in the cost of health care and not necessarily the cost of insurance because it is just a byproduct of hospital, medical tests, doctor, etc costs?

And are you saying that congress should be involved in regulating such....somehow to prevent the mugging??? or is congress the muggers??? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/confused.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Immie, no is pissed at you. Just startled at your poor logic.

Oh great who is this "no"? Some one else I pissed off I see.

And I don't think my logic is poor. COBRA laws help almost no one and if they do not help many people they suck which is what started this conversation in the first place!

Now, let me ask you, if COBRA laws don't help people except fro maybe the very rich like Care and RAVI, then do they no suck?

Cobra is going to help those that can afford six months to a year ahead, being unemployed, or having treated what would otherwise be considered preexisting condition, on a new plan. It was not meant for everyone.

True Health Care Reform could address that regardless who the carrier is, just understand that nothing is for nothing. It will cost someone, the question is who?

The thing is that only the Very Rich CAN afford it. I thought those liberals that wanted to skin me alive for sticking up for the poor, hated the Very Rich.

Seems to me that is a misconception.

That's not true, either. I saved up for it because I knew I was going to need it. A rule of thumb is to keep three months set aside in case all goes wrong (maybe six would be better). Has nothing to do with wealth...just common sense and planning ahead. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_angel.gif"/>

COBRA isn't a social program. Jesus Fucking Christ!

Please, dig up Ronald Reagan and bitch about it to him, he's the one that signed it into law.

People should have more options. That is what the Democrats, as misguided and wussy as they are, are trying to provide. I have no faith that they will come through.

More options?

Please explain how the "misguided and wussy" Democrats are giving us more options.

I think they already did give some money to help the unemployed be able to afford Cobra... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> The public option would be more options.
