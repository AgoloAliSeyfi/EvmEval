Maybe but he has had a hand in the demise of tens of thousands of jobs. Minuscule as that may be, explain that to those who have lost out because of him or his administration.

He also had a hand in creating close to 3 million jobs.

he took my money and gave it to joe so joe can hire tom to do work that gary and his employee Zach would have done but wasnt allowed to do becuase Obama said he wanted Joe to do it with his new employee Tom.

So Gary and Zach lost their jobs and Tom got a job.

Thus why Obama "created" millions of jobs....but there are 1.8 million less people working now.

Are you not aware of how that happened?

Umm, okay, so why didn't Tom get the job if Joe wanted him? I do not understand what would be stopping him.

any given regulation...perhaps not..

But knowing that there is a large influx of regulations...and many more to come?

It is that "concern for the unknown" that stymies economic growth.

Knowiung what the regulation is allows one to compensate..and move forward.

Not knowing what is to come and how much it will cost? That si what we are referring to..

And we have a regulation happy administration right now...that you cant deny.

If you read the article, it also says that Republicans try to perpetuate the myth about the uncertainty businesses face due to regulations.

It is not a myth.

It is real.

It is basic business logic.

You do not make business moves if you can not accurately forecast.

Sort of business planning 101.

It affects small businesses, sure.

Nonsense. He has invested in mostly failed enterprises. There are fewer jobs available now than there were before he took office. He may have helped "a specific" segment, mostly govt or unions but that's it.

</quote>

Untrue, he created 2.5 million private sector jobs under the stimulus.

It is slowly recovering on its own despite Obamas policies and business crunching regulations. I am very glad it is coming around but I just wish we could vote Obama out now to expedite the process.

My prediction is that if Obama loses the election growth will double the current snails pace its growing at. In fact I bet upon the news alone that he loses the election we will start seeing firms hire and invest exponentially.

What regulations would those be?

I just gave all my employees a 10% raise and am looking seriously at renting another warehouse.

OK...then you can relate....

One of my clients was hit with a new local ordnance regarding loading bay width.

Apprarently, some worker at some other company did not follow loading bay rules and tried to walk around the far side of a truck that had little clearance from the wall to the side mirror....he nerly took his entire nose off....for the truck mirror was damaged and sharp.

So the local legislator pushed for a new regulation adding 6 inches to the width of a loading bay.....and it was instituted.

My client had 12 months to comply wioth the new regulation.....and as you know.....it is pretty expensive to have to widen a loading bay.....

He did it at a cost of over 75K.....during a year where his profits barely allowed him his basic s-corp salary of 1K per week...and NO distributions...so he was forced toactually spend an extra 75K in a year where he took home only 52K...

Ya think he wanted to hire new people?

The thing people forget, American workers even without unions will never work for what someone in Indonesia will work for. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>
The one thing we need to do, is not cater to corporations who make their product overseas. You want factory jobs back, that is the only way that will happen.
