I'll answer for the car that I've got on order rather than my current company car (which is a Passat). The one that's on order is an Alfa Romeo Giulietta, with the 1.4 litre Multiair petrol engine.

Basically, I wanted something like a Golf but with sex appeal <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/smile.gif"/> I don't do an awful lot of driving at the moment since I live within walking distance of work (that could change in future although I hope not), so the car is generally used for shortish journeys around town to rehearsals, squash games etc in the evenings and weekends. Once or twice a year I go back to England (I live in Belgium), and I have kids so I do need the back seats to be usable. My limited use and the big jump in price meant that it really isn't worth me getting a family saloon like the Passat or a 3-series. If I ever need a bigger car for a particular trip, I'll hire one - it'll be a lot cheaper than having one all the time.

The Golf dropped off the shortlist because it's boring and because my Passat has been broken into twice in the last six months (they stole the GPS system each time - the police told me it only happens with VW cars because they aren't locked with a code). The final choice was between the Giulietta and the BMW 1-series (probably 118d), but the Alfa won because it's a little bigger in the back, it's a bit cheaper and I think it looks nicer. The Beamer was better to drive, but I'm hoping that's partly because I'm not used to driving a petrol engine any more, as all of my cars in the last 10 years or so have been diesels.

The 1-series is also an old model now (due to be replaced this year, apparently) whereas the Giulietta is pretty new, and has had rave reviews in the motoring press ("the best Alfa Romeo for 25 years"). I've had two Alfas before (156), as well as a BMW 320d, and I liked all of them so it was a nice choice to be able to make!

Finally, I drove the low-end diesel and the MultiAir engines. The diesel is adequate but not exciting, whereas the MultiAir is quite fun. It's only a 1.4 litre engine but it produces 163 or 170 hp (they quote 163 here in Belgium and 170 in the UK....no idea why!) and does 0-100kph in 7.8 seconds...it'll be comfortably the nippiest car I've ever had (previous best was the BMW 320d, at 9.0 seconds).

I can't wait for delivery day! Sadly, that's not until March some time and I lose my current company car at the end of the month, so I will be carless for a few weeks.

PS The Passat's a very nice car too but I've gone off it a bit since it's been broken into twice, as I mentioned.

2007 57 Plate Mazda 6 Tamura.

I chose it because it was going cheap as unrecorded stolen &amp; recovered with keys at the insurance salvage auction about a year and a half ago. Was worth just over £10k at the time with only 7,000 miles on the clock I think and I got it for £6,200. Still worth around £1,000 more than I paid for it.

Same goes for the 2003 Chrsyler Voyager 2.4 SE, needed new passenger side front suspension and wing but was also unrecorded damage so won't show on the log book. Bought it last November with 48,000 miles on the clock for £1,200, spent £500 fixing it and it's still worth around £3,000. Brilliant and useful 2nd car which has never missed a beat and gone all over the place.

I could probably afford to get much better cars than the ones I drive if I got them on finance as we have quite a bit more coming in every month than going out but the wife won't entertain finance so I have to buy them outright and there are too many bargains to pass up at the insurance auctions. Helps that I'm sort of in the trade but I don't like the idea of depreciation all that much and this is one good way to almost completely avoid it.

These cars will be gone in a heartbeat though if a 2007 Grand Voyager or a 2008 Jaguar XJ Sovereign Diesel Sport pops up
