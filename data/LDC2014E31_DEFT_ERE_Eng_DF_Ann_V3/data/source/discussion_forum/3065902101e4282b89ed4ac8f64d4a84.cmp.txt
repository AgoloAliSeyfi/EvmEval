Once again we are a country of over 60 million, less than a million protested in this country. Now you may not be so good at maths, but I'mn sure even you can realise that the protesters were nowhere near the majority.

So the number of protesters determine whether or not they were against the war?

What about the pensioners who couldn't get out of bed or the disabled?
What about the mothers who wanted to protect their kids if the protest turned violent?
What about the men who had to work on that day to feed their families?
What about the people who had the desire to protest but couldn't due to prior family engagements?
What about the people who are NOT allowed to protest?

Once again, there is no excuse for terrorism. Not to mention y'know, that the anti-war protesters weren't the ones that flew planes into buildings beforehand...

So? It was the anti-Imperialist. No one listened to them and they resorted to terrorism.

Look at Northern Ireland where the British tried to enforce their rule upon others.

What 'actual' perpetrators of attacks on Europe? nationalist attacks are incredibly rare and most of them are things like carbombs with hours of warning (aside from Norway this year). Fundamentalist Islamic attacks are designed to kill as many people as possible, nationalist/seperatist attacks generally aren't. They're entirely different things. I've never heard of a nationalist suicide bomber. Comparing the two and suggesting that nationalist/seperatist attacks are more dangerous is ridiculous, try comparing the death tolls caused by ETA in the last 30 years compared to one attack in Madrid by Islamic fundamentalists. Even the IRA failed to cause as many casualties on mainland Great Britain as Pakistani trained suicide bombers did in one day.

So you chucked the statistics out of the window by claiming "nationalist attacks are rare"? At this point, I would like to mention that although nationalist attacks MAYBE rare, they nevertheless are 96.4% more then Al Qaeda bombings.

Does giving "hours of warning" make the act a bit more humane? It sounds like you support terrorist attacks, but with just a tiny weeny bit of warning beforehand. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/>

Suicide bombing - Well, they see it as a more effective tool. They want maximum casualties and the way to go about achieving that is through suicide bombing.

The attacks are going on in Pakistan because Pakistan can't be trusted to deal with the Al-Qaeda/Taliban operatives in their country via their legal system. If Pakistan actually wanted to co-operate and help the fight against these guys then the drone attacks wouldn't be needed. Instead Pakistan is still obsessed with it's age old conflict with India and believes it needs to control Afghanistan to prevent India getting a foothold, thus it constantly funds and trains the same people it's telling America it's fighting.

Well, maybe people are sympathetic to the cause of Afghanistan. People will do what they want to do.

Watch 'Secret Pakistan' on the BBC iPlayer, it's an awesome two part documentary about how Pakistan has been supporting and funding these people for years.

Are you telling me that if Russia invaded, occupied and slaughtered people of England, residents of Wales/Scotland/Northern Ireland would not support and fund the English to get rid of the occupying force by any means necessary, not limited to suicide bombings?

And the 50 million other able bodied people, who make up the vast majority, we should ignore them precisely because they are the majority? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/>

In NOrthern Ireland, despite how I despise the IRA, I can say surely that they did not intentionally try to kill as many civilians as possible, they didn't execute teachers who taught girls, they didn't whip people for not growing beards etc. I never agree with terrorism, but to put the IRA on the same level as AQ or Islamic insurjents just showcases your ignorance.

And if what you do is legal, then feel free to. If you feel the urge to blow **** up, then kindly bog off to the West Bank where you wont affect Britian. Ta.
