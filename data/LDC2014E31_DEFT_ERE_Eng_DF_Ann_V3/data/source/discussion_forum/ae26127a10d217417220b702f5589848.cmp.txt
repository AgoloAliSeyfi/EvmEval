You know, when bodies get mixed up at Arlington, the military haters are out in force with all of their "respect for the dead" lip service.

When you ask them for a little decency and respect in a place where human tissue was flying out of destroyed aircraft on the buildings below as far as far as jet parts, they can't deal with that.

You haven't been in downtown Manhattan have you? Have you even been to the WTC area? There are titty bars right there, should those be forced to close down because they're by the WTC? Answer me that one honestly.

Also, I have two members of my immediate family buried in Arlington. I guess you'd also consider me to be a "military hater" huh? This military hater comes from a military family, and was in a bad car accident in my teenage years that left me unable to pass the physical to become a marine (because I have a metal rod in my left leg, and yes I tried to sign up). Don't use Arlington, or the military for political points. You wont win.

than why the outrage over the Mosque at Ground Zero?

What are you parsing?

What POINT are you trying to relay?

You are MIXING events.

As to the Mosque genius?

The American people have an aversion to allowing the RELIGION of the KILLERS from that day holding SACRED GROUND.

Or aren't you that fucking bright and showing your lackluster brillience at being a Statist moron?

I am not sure I understand the context overall.... but I'll give it a whirl.

I saw that as a twitter btw, in any event if 20 guys like this guy went out and committed the same crimes, then there is most probably a common causality, here this isn't the case, he appears unbalanced and....the end of him is the end of this singular event via his madness that drove him to it. I think the mosque and what we see as motivating factor behind Khobar towers, the embassies, the Cole, 911, Hasan are linked, it doesn't disappear with just 20 Terrorists.

The context is to simply point out that Palin says one thing, but does another.

For the larger issue, If you are going to take that route, then is Islam an inherently evil/violent religion?

what thing has she done and what other thing has she done?

as far as evil? no of course not, but its best we be on our guard, theres only one or 2 threads that ties the overarching threat together...*shrugs* what are we supposed to do forget the minute after a T act is committed or self bungled or unsuccessful for whatever reason?

The mosque issue itself? I wish they would employ understanding and display sensitivity myself...

Yeah, I think they should move the meat market down there, that is almost right across from 911 towers. He always has signs in his big window, leg of lamb, shoulder roast, sliced knuckles, blood sausage, ribs, etc. I think that is disrespectful and not being sensitive to the jumpers. Something about ground hamburger for sale, just isn't right.

First, I have not protested the mosque. When I first heard about the issue, I said, "No frigging way!" A mosque in the footprints of the twin towers would have been disrespectful in my opinion. Twenty minutes later when I had read the truth of the story, that the Islamic Community Center was two blocks away, I was not opposed to the idea.

However, I still believe that a mosque on would be disrespectful.

That being said, the debate over the mosque has nothing to do with whether or not those who want to erect the community center had anything to do with 9/11, but rather whether or not they are showing proper respect to those who lost loved ones at that location.

At least that is how I see it.

You are somehow equating the religion of a set of perpertators to a henous crime...that seem right to you, in the land of the free?

The Glock dealer was no more a perpetrator than the American Imam.

The Glock dealer would not think to open up a store on the site of a mass murder. Nobody would defend the decency of his decision to do that, including me.

The American Imam, he doesn't have the same decency and respect.

Seriously, doesn't this hurt?

It's a great argument.

If you don't agree, refute it.

The cheap shot doesn't cut it Maddie.
