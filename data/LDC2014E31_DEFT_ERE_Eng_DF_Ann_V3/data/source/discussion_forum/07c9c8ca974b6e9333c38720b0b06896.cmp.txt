Hard drugs is a political not a medical term.
Did cannabis suddenly become more dangerous when it was upgraded from class c to class B?
</quote>

Yes it did become more dangerous.

Nationally, skunk smokers are ending up ill in hospital in record numbers, with admissions soaring 73 per cent. The number of adults recorded as suffering mental illness as a result of cannabis use has risen sharply from 430 in 1996 to 743 in 2006.

The government data shows how the damaging effects of the drug have swept across England. Hospital hotspots for cannabis abuse include Manchester, London, Cheshire and Merseyside.

And, as the debate over the drug's dangers continues, figures released by the National Treatment Agency for Substance Abuse (NTA) show that more than 24,500 people are in drug treatment programmes for cannabis Â– the highest ever.

Why is MDMA class A when it is safer than horse riding?
</quote>

Because the criteria for classification as a Class A drug have less to do with death rates and more to do with the fact that when it was classified as Class A, it had no medicinal use and was believed to be a hallucinogen like LSD.

You can list the traits, but just because they share the traits, that doesn't mean they share them equally. That's a pretty basic logical fallacy that would allow you to throw sugar and chocolate into the same category!

The level of addictiveness, level of mood alteration, and level of damage are just not comparable. In particular, alcohol is not inherrently chemically addictive. Certain people are succeptible to alcohol addiction via genetic defect, but that disease does not affect a large part of the population (9% according to the wiki). That is stakly different from hard drugs (or even nicotine or caffiene, for that matter), which can cause chemical addiction in virtually everyone who uses them.

Alcohol also has a safe dosage, so use does not automatically imply misuse or any negative consequences at all. Hard drugs do not have dosage levels where they have limited physiological effects (that, of course, would defeat the purpose for taking them).
It helps to point out the logical flaw and rediculousness of the claim to push it to it's logical extent. You are the one who is broadening the definitions and criteria to the point of uselessness in order to include alcohol in the same category as hard drugs. By broadening it further, chemisttree emphasizes the logical flaw and forces you to (traps you into) address[ing] it. Ie, now that you acknowledge that broadening the criteria too far results in rediculousness, you should make an attempt to justify why your broadening of the criteria doesn't also result in rediculousness.

Wow only 9% of the population is genetically predispositioned to becoming an alcoholic, I just checked the population of the U.S. and as of July 08 it was 303,524,640 and 9% of that is a bit over 37 million, quite an insignificant number indeed. One does not have to be an alcoholic to abuse alcohol unfortunately. In Rapid City, SD they have arrested over 300 for DUI since the first of the year. That is about 3 a day. I am sure that many of them were not alcoholics but that makes little difference.

I spent 30 years in management and safety in the trucking industry and I cleaned up over 100 truck wrecks, 10 of them were fatals with a total of 14 fatalities. Every one of those 10 fatals involved alcohol. In one instance our driver was drunk in 7 it was drunk drivers hittng our trucks and in two instances it was people under the influence using our trucks as a means of suicide. One by throwing himself under the wheels as the truck pulled away from a cafe and another where a young lady, under the influence, had a fight with her boyfriend, demanded that he stop and let her out. When he did, she ran out into the freeway and stood in front of our truck. Our driver tried to stop and tried to evade her but she moved back in front of the truck. I doubt seriously that you can get the same results with coffee or chocolate.

Just a thought but if alcohol is not addictive, why did so many people risk fines and jail to drink it during prohibition when they could have just drank coffee or ate a Hershey Bar.

In my previous post I said the guy who hit and killed 2 people got 7 years, I was wrong he only got 4.

I remember from working for the Salvation Army that alcohol is a hard drugs...when you are adicted to it. However, recreational use is possible. I love to watch football with some friends and some beers. I wondered if I could enjoy the game if me and my friends would shoot up some heroin first. The problem with hard drugs is that recreational usage is not really possible. A serious alcohol adiction is right up there with other hard drugs.
