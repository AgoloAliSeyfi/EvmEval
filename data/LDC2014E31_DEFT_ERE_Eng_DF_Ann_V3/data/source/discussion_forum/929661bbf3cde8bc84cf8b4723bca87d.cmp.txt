Urgh, I simply used those words because they are typical examples of Republican rhetoric on this issue. I despise people who throw the term socialism around without knowing what it means (I'm talking about them, not you). The basis of the welfare state was laid by Lloyd George under a liberal government, and welfare liberalism precedes socialism as an influence on government policy in the UK.

It's also worth noting the real politik of the situation - Conservatives have supported it since the 50's, yes. That's because it helped a lot of people and to denounce it would be electoral suicide. Do you really think that, had it not been initiated in the late forties, the Tories would have ever sought to create it? This sort of demonstrates how little support from political parties matters with regards to whether or not it is socialist.

I'm aware that there are ideological crossovers, but to simply label elements of the welfare state as "socialist" without looking at precisely what their purpose in and the way in which they relate to the rest of society I consider to be intellectually lazy.

Regarding the Conservatives, well they expanded upon the Labour party's house building program, and did their best to match expenditure on the NHS. Do I believe that they would have created the NHS had it not been created by Labour? Quite possibly, again because I don't believe there would have been a great deal of contradiction between it and the pre-Thatcher Tory ideology, combined with the fact that it was electorally popular. It arguably wouldn't have been as extensive as the NHS as it was created under Labour, but that doesn't alter the principle.

That situation has been forced by the NHS, due to it providing an adequate service and there being no opt-out of the tax. This means that if a private company wants to operate, it must offer a considerably better service (since the population already gets - whether it wants it or not - an adequate service for its money), and this costs a lot of money. Were the NHS not to exist, you'd have considerably more range available. If the government started taking £10k more from everyone in tax, and gave everyone a £10k car like, I dunno, a Focus, then no one would ever buy a £15k or £20k or probably even £30k car again, because "upgrading" to a car like that on top of what they'd be paying in tax would be a severe case of diminishing returns. You'd be left with a two tier system - those with their Focus, and those with their Jags and Bentley's - much like we have with healthcare now.

Now, before you wish death upon me, I'm not advocating either. None of what I've just said is opinion, it's just basic economics and consumer spending. No one's going to pay what they've already paid again for only a marginal improvement in their healthcare quality, which results in private healthcare only being available to the rich, but it is, as a result, much better. This, combined with the governments approach to medical courses at university and the NHS, means that - whilst you're correct when you say the government doesn't own the whole means of "production" for the health care industry - its stranglehold is such that, for the vast, vast majority, they have no choice but to go for the government owned and run operation. The only people for whom the NHS is not, there, a de facto socialist institution, are the rich.

Well given the partial privatisation of the NHS, I don't believe that's true. Moreover, I don't believe that providing a level of healthcare for everyone in itself constitutes socialism. What I do believe, however, and what I believe is supported by the US example, is that the absence of this free on demand service would leave large numbers of people worse off. If you're arguing against the NHS because it crowds out parts of the private sector, whilst still allowing some elements to exist, then I don't believe that constitutes an argument, because healthcare should be run for the benefit of the patient, rather than for the benefit of those who want to make money of the misfortune of others.

Lolwut <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/lolwut.gif" alt=":lolwut:"/> So you expect me to keep paying £120 a month for yours and others healthcare and then pay additional private healthcare for myself.

No. You should be able to opt-out of the NHS if anything. I don't see why i should pay for some unemployed drug dealer who breaks his leg running away from the police. Nor do i see why i should pay for the excellent service received by your sister when mine was so bad.
