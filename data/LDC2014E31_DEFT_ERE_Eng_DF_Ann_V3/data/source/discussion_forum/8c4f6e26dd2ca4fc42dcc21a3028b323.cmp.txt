The attack on Charles achieved two things:

1. It proved beyond ANY doubt the true mindset of the protestors.

2. It proved beyond ANY doubt the astonishing scale of their ignorance.

“They’re government ******” one academic scholar shouted as they attacked the car!

Oh dear, where can you begin to explain how farcically wrong that assertion was… But hey, just like the policy everyone is so conveniently misunderstanding and so heroically protesting against, don’t let something like the fundamental facts get in the way.

OK, so you’ve smashed a lot of sh** up, and clearly after making such an commendable, no INSPIRATIONAL appeal the government will now scrap all of their plans. So what about PLAN B? Well here’s an idea, maybe they could just make a couple of simple changes:

1. All bul**** filler courses could be scrapped.

2. All funding and placements could be based strictly upon of attendance and performance.

Hey, just like in the REAL world! Wow, imagine that!!! No really, imagine that.

I’m not old, I’m not posh, I’m not well off, I don’t read the daily mail and I’m not against the odd bit of revolution. BUT, I AM severely disgusted by all of this self absorbed whinging and the incongruous pretence that this was anything more than a exciting jolly for most of the protestors. You know it, we know it, so let’s get it out there.

And just to clarify, like so many have tried to explain beforehand (until blue in the face), ELECTION pledges are for parties that WIN ELECTIONS, not parties that come 3rd. (If you missed that simple point just read it again until it finally sinks in).

So even with a heavy sprinkling of negative spin and selective misunderstanding, the rest really is just inconsequential. But again, why should the simple facts get in the way of such profound LOUD SHOUTY NOISES. Indeed as everyone knows, if you shout loud enough the facts will no longer matter.

Ultimately I wonder how many actually read and digested these policy changes; including the various generous increases in benefits, extended free placement opportunities and fee capping safety measures? Cleary none, or they might have grasped that rich OR POOR, no one has ANYTHING to moan about. No really, just read and digest all the facts and this will become very apparent. Too much effort, don’t really care?

Today’s attack on Prince Charles was nothing more than a culmination of breathtaking arrogance and comatosed crowd following. What a sad indictment on a generation.

Never have so many, shown so much ignorance, whilst achieving so very little.

Thanks for listening, have a great day wathing TV and make sure you roll a phat one.

Mind PMing the details of this program? Given the way IP addresses are set up commercially I am highly sceptical if it works as you say.

WOW !

What part of being put on ignore did you not understand?

I was talking to someone else, yet again you seem to interupt. I have no reason to engage in conversation with you so that is it.

If you want to continue wasting your time typing out a response to my posts then please do so.

Back on ignore he goes.

Sensitive issue, was it?

Not really.

You just spat your dummy out because I proved you wrong about the House Of Commons &amp; Lords thing so I thought I'd spit mine out.

You started insulting the Welsh which in my opinion was pathetic considering I was just trying to help the future English students.

The future for Welsh students is fine. No high fee's for us but then as soon as I try to prove their is still some hope for English students you jump down my throat.

End of discussion. Feel free to respond but it will go unanswered.

I proved you wrong - that is that.

Note: Also to the person I said I can track IP's, you do so through this very forum as it runs on PHP so therefore you can find out the IP address of a user on here.

You then use a Linux based program to track the IP. Its commercial software as well.

I'll be more than happy to provide you with the details through a private message.

Regards.

cant say I feel much sympathy the poor have always been oppressed by the rich. Spending 5 months unemployed, whilst not getting 3 months of the benefits owed because of stupid incompetent people working at the job centre along with having to move to a different city just to find a job make me very angry and hateful towards the system. Theres many other things, the iraq war, 9-11, the media in society etc etc.

Yeah I do believe that everyone should be treated fairly, but i just dont care quite frankly when its to do with super rich corrupt people who never earnt what they got while most people live with nothing.

call me "impolite"
