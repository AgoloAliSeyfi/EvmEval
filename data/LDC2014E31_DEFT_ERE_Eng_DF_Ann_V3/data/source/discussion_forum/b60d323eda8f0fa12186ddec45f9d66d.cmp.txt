all this pissing is annoying. You guys pay nothing compared to the us. Your measly 9,000 fee hike would get you one term at a decent american uni. Half of a term at a top american uni. International fees+housing+food+spending money at a uk uni is equal to just tuition for one year at an american uni.

Now before you guys start throwing stuff at police and whining "yeah it's different though, it's not the same, you can't compare it, blahblah."...... Consider what it could be. That's all i ask. Just consider what it could be.

Props to those on this forum that recognize the fact that a fee hike sucks but suck it up and move on.

We don't care. This is not the US.

That is about loans not about grants or fee payment. Gee whizz people, I am beginning to think that the reason England doesn't pay it's students fee's is because you are all so bloody stupid!

What income threshold do you fall under? I studied in England and my fees were paid by taking out a loan, and I also had to take out a loan for maintenance, both of which had to be paid back. The Students Outside Scotland Bursary does not amount to over £5000.

The only way which I can think of that would permit you to have such a high level of support is if your income was extremely low, or if you were not in a household with any working parents/guardians.

I studied in London and yes I come from a very poor background.

On your award notice from SAAS, what does it say for tuition fees? Loan for tuition fees, or does it declare some form of bursary or grant, because you are the only person I have ever heard of to study in England and subsequently get their fees paid for them by SAAS in the form of a non repayable grant/bursary.

Scottish students are likely to have to start paying fees in some form very soon - there's a green paper going before the Scottish Executive about that very issue before the year is out.

Yeah- i heard something about that.

Within the first line of the link:
If you take out a student loan for your tuition fees

Fees. Repayable.

Firstly, this just seems ridiculous, how possibly can they consider raising our fees whilst Scottish students are still getting their fees paid for them?

</quote>

You're incredibly ignorant. They are looking into the funding of Scottish universities in Scotland just like they are in other parts of the UK. Obviously there isn't much media coverage of this where you live though.

Secondly, EU students aren't subject to paying fees for Scottish University whilst English and Welsh students (despite us being in the EU too..) pay full fees which seems to be 'double standards' if you ask me.
</quote>

Actually it is EU law which enforces this policy. English, Welsh and Northern Irish students only have to pay £1820 to study at a Scottish university.

No, EU students get Scottish university free, UK students don't. <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/international/finance/fees">http://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/international/finance/fees</a>

I have a letter from my local MP, which means I probably have far more information than you do about it...
Secondly, there was a vote in June 2010, where they backed the existing funding arrangements for Scottish Uni's, so this seems set to stay for the short run anyway...

That's exactly what I said. The reason EU students get their tuition fees paid for is because of EU law.
