The famous 16 words were correct. The British did have evidence the Iraqis were trying to buy uranium. MI-6 stood by that statement. So it was an accurate statement. they didn't get it, but they asked for it.

Look, guy, George Tenat went into Bush's office and said "It's a slam dunk, Mr. President!"

Joe Wilson wrote in the LA Times that no only did Saddam have WMD's, but we needed to give him a graceful way out because he'd use them.

This is a lot of people playing CYA when something goes wrong. If you had a real job, you see it happens every day in the business world, who ends up holding the bag of dog poop.

Wow, you have totally drank the kool-aid. Next, you're gonna tell us that Saddam was behind 9/11. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Myself. Saddam was a scumbag and I'm glad he's dead. Aren't you?

Not at the cost of over $1 Trillion and over 5,000 U.S. military deaths. HELL NO!!!!

Well then-what is your opinion on us getting involved in Libya?

</quote>

My opinion is that Bush spent $1 T rillion to get Saddam.

Obama spent $1 B illion to get Gaddafi.

Looks like Obama has plenty of CEO-type executive experience to me. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

I put the words they probably said... because they are the only ones that make sense.

Grow a fuckin' sense of humor, for crying out loud.

When you have to make heroes out of under-acheiving affirmative action hires, you know you are really kind of weak in the hero department.

Yes, I know. The words that made sense to you. The dialogue from the movie in your head. Meanwhile, we've got a real world going on out here.

The famous sixteen words were taken out of the SOTU address Bush gave because the intell to back it up was not there. The Bush administration put them back in.

Two points.

1) The Democrats looked at the same evidence,and came to the same conclusions.

2) So you are saying that it wasn't worth it if it went over a certain cost. Good thing you werne't around during WWII. "Wow, getting Hitler is too expensive. Better just let him kill those people."
