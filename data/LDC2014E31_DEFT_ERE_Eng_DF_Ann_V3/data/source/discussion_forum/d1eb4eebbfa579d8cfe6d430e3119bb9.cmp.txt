Actually I know plenty about this subject. Germany were winning, but it wasn't just the winter that stopped them. The decision to divert the offensive south to Kiev instead of Moscow gave the Soviets time to redeploy Siberian troops to Moscow in time to face the Germans. They had superior numbers in troops and equipment.

It seems YOU have no idea what you're talking about.

What aircraft carriers? You just scrapped the last on you had. Better soldiers, yeah they must feel real big picking on Afghan teenagers, and poorly trained militia, they wouldn't find it so easy against a real fighting force. Better jets, What jets? Eurofighters? Are they gonna fly all the way to the Falklands from Britain to provide 24/7 coverage? You are a patriotic fool, who denies the facts.

And actually the figures from India's defense spending come from the CIA factbook, see how my sources go beyond wikipedia?

The major powers know that both India and China are spending more than they declare, just like the US and probably most military powers, you don't show potential enemies your full hand if you don't need to.

The West is in terminal decline. While the East is rising. It's only a matter of time before the West loses it's ability to invade small countries at will, in order to steal their resources and bully their populations.

Most historians cite the fact that German soldiers were caught in Russia during the winter as the sole turning point. I have not heard one say that the decision to divert troops was the most important factor, so why would I include it?

We scrapped the last aircraft carrier? Amazing how it's helping to enforce the arms embargo in Libya then. Also, you obviously haven't seen the new aircraft carriers that are being developed for 2019 - look up Queen Elizabeth Class. The UK still have the HMS Illustrious until the new class is developed, not quite the same as getting rid of them all.

In terms of jets we have the Tornado, the Eurofighter and the BAE Hawk, which funnily enough, India have bought off of us. Why would they buy off the UK? Also, the F-35 Lightning II is joining in 2020. Looks like the UK will be safe for some time to come. Need I even say Trident?

The West is in decline - okay then, if you say so. I personally won't be worried about India, because I know that they can't do anything. Anyway, your break is over, back to the call centre!!

Oh, I feel so sorry for the poor white people, they've had it sooooo bad.

Who the hell are the blacks, who were enslaved by whites to complain?

Who the hell are the Indians, who were enslaved and robbed blind by whites to complain?

They've been sooo bad to the whites over the years, haven't they? And it's not like Blacks and Asians ever suffer discrimination at the hands of whites, is it?

Poor whites. You have it so bad.

Idiot.

racist scum boy.

'white people' never enslaved blacks, africans sold their captives to the private europeans traders. blacks were purchased from other blacks.

how dare you try and blame slavery on whites you racist.

the vast, vast majority of white people have spent their entire history in dire poverty until relatively recently. they never had anything to do with slavery or the crimes of governments elected by landowners, or tryants elected by no one.

serfs, subjects. indentured servants. slaves. oppressed. raped. sweat shop workers. lower classes........thats the history of white people you racist fool.

I think the far right should get into power. Would love to see the subsequent war erupt between East and West. It's long past time that White people know how it feels to be beaten, occupied and oppressed.

This isn't racism, it's realism. It makes sense. The only reason Whites think they are superior to everyone else is because they've never been beaten by Non-Whites. Once that changes, all the arrogance that comes with White identity will go out the window.

It's the only way to create a true, real equality in the human race.

If by "White" you mean European, and not Caucasian, then you are my friend is a historically ignorant person,
There was numerous wars thought history around the Mediterinean between the Semites ( including Arab Muslims ), Persians and the Northern Europeans of which the non Europeans emerged victorious. In fact Southern Europe up to the south of France was ruled by Arabs for 8 centuries.
Don't forget,..Hannibal, Saladin, the Phoenician and many others..
Also the Ottomans reached the borders of Austria like 100 years back.

Racism and the love of one's race is a universal thing not exclusive to Europeans.
