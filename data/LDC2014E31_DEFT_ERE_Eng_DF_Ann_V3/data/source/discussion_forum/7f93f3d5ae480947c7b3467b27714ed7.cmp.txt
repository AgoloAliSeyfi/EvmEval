well..does anyone else feel like this?

I love having friends, girly chats coffee etc, but somehow feel sad sometimes how things often work out with friends. <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/frown.gif"/>

I was really close with one friend who was in similar circumstances to me (we both had young kids at the time)we were often at eachothers houses and had such a laugh! but then as the years rolled by, and I got to know her REALLY well, I could'nt cope with her out spokenness,she was so direct &amp; opinionated..I'd often stew over stuff she'd said and felt irritated about it. If we went out for a meal, she'd get drunk and would say hurtful stuff...I started to distance myself from her to avoid an arguement.

Another friend I met seemed really one of the most genuine, lovely people i'd had the pleasure to meet....she was such a breath of fresh air, she did'nt care about clothes or material things, she was more interesting than that, she valued her friendships..read books...she seemed to be a really thoughtful person who would do anything for you. Early in our friendship she confessed her marriage was in trouble...I spent many hours with her talking and listening, trying to make sense of her troubles and provide a shoulder to cry on. she told me how much she valued our friendship and how she loved our girly chats. two years on, she sorted out her problems and is now so happy. I am so pleased for her, I never bring it up what she confided in me. But ive got a nagging feeling ive been dropped!! I do still see her occasionally, we bump into each other a lot, but the invites to come round for coffee have become less &amp; less. she seems to have made some new friends ive noticed...and im jealous!!! <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/speechless-smiley-040.gif"/> why am i being like this!!!
I know in my heart that its silly and im thinking like a child. just can't stop feeling this way. Ive got a fantastic hubby whom im close to and love very much, and a lovely,busy family life,so it's not as if my life is empty.
Im on facebook, and Ive been thinking of coming off it because its encouraging these negative thoughts. I can see my friends and what they are saying to eachother, one friend just invited another lady (whom i don't know)and her family over for a meal- I was jealous! its ridiculous, is'nt it? wish I could stop thinking this way. <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/frown.gif"/>

Do you invite people over to yours though?

I remember when I left school and went to college, all my friends stayed at school sixth form. I used to feel really left out as I'd hear afterwards that they'd been out, done this, done that etc. But then I realised that instead of waiting for them to invite me, all I had to do was ring one of them 'just for a chat cos I haven't seen you for a while' and hey presto, they'd invite me to whatever they were doing. Once they remembered that I needed inviting to things because I was no longer in a position to hear about things in discussion I never got left out again. But I had to make that move and remind them I was still there, even though I was at a different college.

I think you need to stop obsessing about what your friends are doing without you, and start inviting them to do things with you. Pick up the phone and invite them round, don't wait for them to do the inviting.

I have also discovered though that some friendships have a lifespan, and sometimes you do have to let it go and move on. People change, lives change and perhaps you don't have much in common any more. Perhaps you could find a new hobby (I know that's not as easy as it sounds but think about it) and meet new people.

Facebook can be so poisonous! People can't think about all the things they say on there and how it will affect every person that might see it, including people they don't even know!

I agree with There Goes Trouble. Firstly that you are closer with different people at different stages of your life. I don't have kids but most of my friends do and talking with them now (they mostly have babies) sometimes I crave to talk about stuff other than feeding and bedtimes! I feel myself distancing from them a little bit, not because I don't like them but because we don't have so much in common anymore. They are still fantastic people and I will still keep in contact, but its not the same and thats ok, everyone wants different things in life.

Ask yourself what you look for in a friend too. The two stories you tell both suggest (and I am merely commenting on what you wrote, you may feel differently) that they were both using you in their own way. The first one said hateful things (maybe to try and make herself feel better?) and the second doesn't see you as much now that she doesn't need a shoulder to cry on. I wouldn't contact the first one again by the sound of things, but perhaps try asking the second friend out for a coffee and if she keeps avoiding it or cancelling then move on and find someone who better appreciates your company. Clearly you are good at making friends, you just need to find the right people <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/wink.gif"/>
