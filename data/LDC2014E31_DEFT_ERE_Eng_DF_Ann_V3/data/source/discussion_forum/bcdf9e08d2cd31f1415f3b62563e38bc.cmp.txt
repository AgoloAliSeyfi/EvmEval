What Hindu majority, At present there is no unity within Hindu, with all this caste crap divisions, so which majority.
Actually talking of Colonial the present corrupt Indian, Pakistani governments have not really progressed as expected, some of it due to the great evil of partition. Better of USA model of strong regional states and weak centre, that way people regionally get more, and you wont get loggerheads.

Better if British had remained in some form, as present leaders just corrupt, and people would have been better off.

At the time, an India that includes present day Pakistan would have been ruled by the Hindu majority Indian National Congress, which Muslims feared would totally ignore their rights and wants, with the added context of widespread sectarian violence, that is why Muslims felt they must have a seperate NAtion. Also, the INC rejected various proposals at federal deals and so forth.

I agree, I think the British should have stayed there in some form or another, or at least had a more gradual transfer, but we bowed to the fishes of the natives, and the mess that they are in is their fault. The belief the belief that everything would be rosy once the British left was ridiculous.

I apologise in advance if there is something similar to this thread, but this is a topic that has interested me recently and would just like to hear your views on the matter.
I'm a British Pakistani, born and brought up in London, however I would say I am very much in touch with my roots and my views lean more towards the traditional and conservative side. Recently I watched a documentary by Saira Khan 'Don't tell my Mother I am in Pakistan', made a few years ago, yet a very interesting watch. I have been on holiday to Pakistan a fair amount of times, and have traveled throughout the country, so I thought I had a pretty accurate idea of the country as a whole and it's people. However, after watching the documentary and various other programs and films on Pakistan I am absolutely shocked. I may be wrong when I say this, but was Pakistan not founded as a Muslim state, yet only 64 years on and I don't think the country matches the vision it was initially created with. It seems that the higher class are obsessed with imitating and adopting western culture, in a sense it boosts their superiority complex. I actually find it shocking, that most families who moved to England in the 60's like my grandfather have managed to maintain that cultural pride and certain traditions that have been lost among certain groups of people in Pakistan. Drinking is a common practice with the upper class society and personally I find it quite upsetting, it seems as if Pakistan is moving in the opposite direction- the rich becoming more obsessed with western culture and the less well off being neglected further. Also whilst I'm on this topic, has anyone seen the film 'Slackistan' and what were your views?
Thank for reading my thoughts! <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

There's a phenomenon recognised in sociology in which migrants often tend to self-consciously retain social and cultural values which they believe are unchanging in the old country - partly as a way of maintaining a strong sense of identity in a new and potentially hostile land. Meanwhile back in the old country there's no such pressure to 'know who you are' and so greater infiltration of social and cultural liberalisation brought about, albeit in ad hoc fashion, through capitalism. This kind of change is global.

Lol what utter crap- the british were the experts of divide and conquer and were the ones to encourage religious extremism of all sorts in india (islamic, sikh and hindu) because they inderstood the emotive power of such and it helped them take control of the various independant kingdoms. They used similar tactics to stir sectarian/tribal discourse in various other parts of the world for generations-it was the Empires forte'. british pretty much invented the idea of suicide bombings during the crusades and know all about the use of sectraian violence and used it to their advantage. What they created was a a muslim population with an appetite for extremist views and religious isolation- hence why pakistan was created.
