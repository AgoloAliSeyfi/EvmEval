EMA being scrapped, fair enough. Taking away free travel is too far though. If anything I think it should be rolled out for the whole country and not just London. Not getting EMA would not have stopped me going to college to do A Levels but transport costs could be tipped it for me.

That. And by 'it', I mean free travel.

I don't know a single person who actually uses their EMA for anything college related, just gets spent on booze, drugs, and other crap.

Waste of money.

Good for them. Well, our nearest shop is 2 miles away, so that's how rural we are. I could work from 5-10 each night of the week, but to do that I'd need to find a job vacancy that doesn't ask for experience, hope that no more experienced or qualified applicants apply, hope the hours fit and hope the hours aren't subject to change as many jobs are.

Believe me, I want to work. I really do. But getting a job here is nigh on impossible without a car, which I can't afford because I don't have a job...

So leaves £10 for all the other stuff. But that never really goes far, especially when things like council tax etc need to be paid.

The only reason I stayed on at school was becuase of EMA. Otherwise i'd be working full time somewhere.

So I don't have enough for everything.

And they're trying to get the jobs that we want and there is a recession, therefore people want to keep their jobs. So what chance do you think you're going to get of getting a part-time job. Very low, that's what I say. Everyone's trying to hold onto their job.

What steps have you taken to getting a new job?

How many cv's have you given out in the past month exactly?

True this. So many things need looking at.

My Dad got £60 a week for 6 months when he lost his job.

I don't have time to get a new job, I only just got this job a month ago. In total before I got this job, probably 30 CV's I handed out, no one replied.

Don't get me wrong, I'd love to go look for another job but fitting it in with school work is difficult. I'm not the brainiest kid but I'm not the dumbest so thing take a little longer for it to go in and that. So weekends and that help. If I was working on the weekends then I'm not sure if I could cope.

No, my parents aren't scroungers they both work full time. Although my Dad was unemployed for about 9 months last year, got made redundant.
