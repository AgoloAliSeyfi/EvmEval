To the OP and those that seem to be in agreement with it's bogus implication...

...willful ignorance and half-baked hyperbolic nonsense is not a compelling argument.

Okay everyone! Manifold says this is a non-issue. Might as well pack it up..............

The "effect" people are talking about isn't simple political rhetoric designed to sway votes. It's whether or not political rhetoric can cause people to do violence. I actually think Lougher acted the way he did out of some sort of form of psychosis. I don't blame Glen Beck, Sarah, Palin, or anyone else for the crazy things that crazy people do.

2) To compare any American political rhetoric, no matter how allegedly 'violent,' to the edicts issued by OBL and other Islamic terrorist leaders is about as fucking retarded as it gets.

You obviously missed the point of the OP. For the record (and those slow on the uptake), I am not comparing American political rhetoric to anything that comes out of OBL's mouth. So I agree with your last sentence.

The point is this: Sarah Palin made a stink about the Mosque that is two blocks away from Ground Zero due to the fact that it was close to (as we all know) the site of the twin towers that were destroyed by fanatical muslim terrorists. The people behind the Mosque had nothing to do with the 9-11 attack. However, they were held accountable for it all the same.
Then, a year or so later, some crazy asshole in Arizona shoots up a bunch of people, to include a 9 year old girl and a congresswoman, and the left wing punditry (erroneously) claims Palin is inciting these events with her "vitriol" and shares some blame over the event.

Palin get's all high and fucking mighty and makes the statement: "Crimes begin and end with the people who commit them".

See the hypocrisy?

OK, thanks for the explanation.

However, I believe I've found the disconnect and bolded it above.

I do not recall anyone suggesting that those behind the ground zero mosque were to be held accountable for 9/11. If there were, my guess is it was a tiny tiny fringe minority.

But by all means, provide some links and prove me wrong. I'd be much obliged if you can.

If they aren't being held accountable, then why would anyone give a damn if they build a mosque within a two block radius of Ground Zero?

Personally, I didnt' give a crap about the mosque. But I can understand how some might have found it insensitive. But I don't see how finding it insensitive constitutes holding those behind it accountable for 9/11.
