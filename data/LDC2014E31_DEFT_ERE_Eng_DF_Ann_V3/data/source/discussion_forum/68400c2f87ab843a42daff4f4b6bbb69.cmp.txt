That's pretty close to the truth although I think he suffered from other problems and scapegoated others for those problems. This is common among people who suffer deep depression or other illnesses. Now, if he was drinking on the job he just exacerbated the situation 10 fold because alchohol is simply a sedative that slowly puts your brain to sleep starting with the logical side so your left running on pure emotion. Very bad and has nothing to do with him being black.

Being black isn't a genetic defect.....but mentally this guy was all screwed up because of his obsession with race.

This guy was messed up....only a social degenerate feels that murder is a solution to depression.

I think race was simply an easy answer for him. I don't think he was necessarily racist to begin with. It's possible, but we don't have enough to data to say either wasy so we can only speculate.

You'd be surprised what extremely sad people are capable of when they start to pin their problems on the wrong people. They turn hate into violence.

would you acknowledge that if the man was white and the victims were all black the media would be doing much more "speculation" as to how big a role race played in the murders?
there would definitely be serious "speculation" that he was a tea party member, or that he read glenn beck or sean hannity.

If he had been white and ALL his victims black..... ya the press would not have mentioned that at all.

Maybe if the company hired more blacks or asians all the victims wouldn't have been white.

If this man was the Victim of Racial Problems at work. Why is it he never mentioned them to the Company or His Union Rep? Hmmmm? Hmmmm? One word to his Union rep and he could have had the NAACP, and ACLU all over their asses. I find it hard to believe he Never reported them to the Union. Sounds Fishy to me.

It would be hard to sell Omar as a racist since his girlfriend of eight years was white. It looks like he was in an envrionment of racism and the company is stoopid for trying to deny it. He fucked up by stealing and blamed others for his mistake and tried to use racism to justify his sick ass murder spree. He isn't the first American terrorist to use guns to solve his problems and he won't be the last. Considering guns is how our government tries to solve many problems I'm surprised more people don't do it.

He was just a disgruntled common thief who got caught stealing beer (on video), got fired, mass murdered, who happened to be black.
No more, no less.
Onto the next roadside attraction.....

No he is not. He told his girlfriend he was discriminated against on more then one occasion.

From what I read his union rep was one of the people who displayed racism against him. Plus, we all know filing a formal complaint can bring harsh backlash if the charges are true. It really doesn't matter if he was a victim of racism or not because either way it would not explain nor justify his response of mass murder after getting busted for stealing.

So? It doesn't change the fact he was a disgruntled ex-employee proven to be a thief who committed mass murder.
