Round here the fingerpointing in the press is pretty much only towards the Tea Party* and Boehner. Obama is usually only mentioned as sort of a "moderator" in the whole story. Instead of Bush they're often referring to Clinton and Newt Gingrich. And the fact that Clinton (as the equivalent to Obama in this line of thought) was reelected in the end.
The US deficit per se is blamed entirely on Norquist and Bush acting as his puppet btw. Presented as fact, no discussion necessary.

* Quotes on SPON today describing the Tea Party:
- "Republican hardliners" / "conservative hardliners"
- "Radicals"
- "styling themselves as enemies of the system"
- "risking a possible world economy downturn"
- "unpragmatic"
- "stuck in an ideological trench"
- "right-wing populists"

The last one, from the German perspective, is almost equivalent to calling them neonazis. They also emphasize that e.g. Cantor is a southerner.

I saw a McCain speech where he calls them 'hobbits'.

Bah, blow the whole thing up I don't have much to lose, the US is the biggest benificiary of the current world order, that they're on the verge of blowing it up themself is amusing enough that it might be worth the trouble to watch.

Well - if the thing blows up, our business definitely has something to loose (invariably through floating of the dollar). We were discussing just the other day the need to start looking at diversification for recession.

LOL... I've been musing about about the media's shaping of opinion rather than reporting the news on this one. Whilst it could be quite bad - I like the focussing on the Tea Party as the 'culprit'. It's an easy minority to scapegoat - however lost somewhere in the scape goating is the Tea Parties exists through dissatisfaction. I.E it's easy enough to go round passing the blame, but it's not their fault someone's got sick of spending money that isn't theirs and decided to make a stand. It is a beautiful sight really - the U.S political system might as well be at war with itself, where both parties have built a spending culture that ultimately is undercutting themselves.... infesting the system so much that it reaches critical point. They led themselves down this path, all they have left is to blame someone.

In Australia in 1975, when this happened, the Governor General dismissed the ALP for the political impasse it caused - where the country became ungovernable. Sent the issue to the electorate - where the matter was promptly resolved.

If you were a financier - you'd love the stereotyping of the Tea Party that's going on - you almost hold the nation in blackmail to increase the dept ceiling.

Who was it that said "where there is confusion there's profit"?

Here's the thing I cannot understand. The Tea Party suddenly came into existence in 2009, right after Obama's election - and started rallying/ worrying about US Debt, when the finalized ARRA (Bailout) package was announced by Obama. They started blaming Obama and the democrats of "making the country go bankrupt". Yet, a year before that, in 2008 when the US economy was in doldrums, and Bush had announced the bailout plan, which was essentially the same as Obama's plan, where were the "Tea Party" people? Before that, when Bush and fellow republicans were raising debt limit to borrow money and service the Iraq and Afghanistan war, where were these Tea partiers? When Bush announced the Medicare prescription plan without ANY revenue source, where were the tea partiers? When the US economy was going from a surplus to one of gross deficit between 2000 and 2008, where were the tea partiers?
The way they suddenly came out from under the rocks in 2009, right after Obama election and have been supporting republican candidates against all logic, seems to me that "tea Party" is nothing but the extreme half of the republicans, gone wild... :D

I've a question for you economy and military types.

What is the best, worst, and most likely scenario should the US Default on all of it's debt, and how likely are the best, worst, and most likely scenario is to occur?

Further, why does the dollar has to become worthless if the US Defaults?

I've worked out that if the US loses all of it's debt, the lack of Interest payments(~$200B) should balance even the worst budget.

I especially would like to hear the opinions of the military professionals like OOE who seem to be very quiet on this subject.
