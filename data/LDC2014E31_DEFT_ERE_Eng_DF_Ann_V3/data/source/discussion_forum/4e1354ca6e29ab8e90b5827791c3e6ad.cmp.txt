I'm pretty sure two wrongs don't make a right.

I'm Romany. It's in my blood and it's the way I was raised. The attitudes towards the Roma, and towards anyone with a travelling background in the UK are few and far between. Some people tolerate you, they get on with you, or they hate you and wish you despair and destruction. Last time we were hated and persecuted on such a grand scale, a large proportion of us ended up dead in concentration camps. I'd like to think we've moved on since then.

Not everyone of gypsy descent, is a con-artist. We're not all anti-social, anti-establishment, tax-dodging, benefit-grabbing troublemakers. Some of us went to university, some of us embrace our culture and some of us try to integrate with society, like the Romany people have been doing for how many years now? Historically, if we travelled to a country, we abided by their laws and customs, even adopting the religion of the land in some cases, simply for a quiet life. Somewhere along the way though, things have changed. Irish Travellers and the Roms are grouped together, despite being separate entities. The gypsies in the media that you hear about, are just a fraction of a population that has never bothered anyone.

So, to the topic at hand: the situation on Dale Farm is complicated. Personally, I don't entirely see the logic of building upon land when travelling is the staple of our culture. Building implies settling, which ultimately should therefore involve adherence to the building and planning regulations of the United Kingdom. It could however, be argued that the council's decision to evict them, is impinging upon our culture, which could be classed as discrimination. I'm not sure where the EU stands on this, as it's not covered by the 2004 directive on freedom of movement. It's not France all over again, since the people at Dale Farm, aren't actually being deported, they're simply being told to move to a new location and to adhere to planning regulations (which are there for their safety too, no?) It's inconvenient certainly, and yes, if you've been in the same place for several years, it's quite depressing, but it could also be worse.

I don't think the council are wrong in following their own guidelines and enforcing their stance on planning permission, but I do feel that the negative stigma surrounding gypsies (of all descent) isn't helping matters or portraying an unbiased view of our culture through the media coverage taking place. I think that a nomadic life should be encouraged if that's the lifestyle choice that wishes to be adopted, and to have more widely available sites to temporarily settle upon would be beneficial to that end.

This was really interesting to read, thank you.

I have nothing against Gypsies at all, there are plenty where I live, but I wonder whether all these people who say they should be allowed to remain would feel the same way if it were their home that they were unlawfully building on? The man, Mr Gridley or whatever his name was, said his property had been devalued by £300,000, but nevermind the devaluation, who would buy it at all? No one can say they're not hostile to be fair, they've rigged up gas canisters as flame throwers and claim they're going to use petrol bombs and kill people. One of the women clearly stated that "lives will be lost". Surely they have no grounds to take anyones life since the vast majority are there illegally and thus should respent whatever authority tells them what they should be doing. They said they will burn the village to the ground before anyone moves them out. Really? We should respect these peoples wishes why exactly? They're the kind that give a bad name to Gypsies.

The law is the law. Everyone follows the law, that's why it's the law and not "rules for everyone except gypsies".

Gypsies give a bad name to Gypsies, frankly. Their entire social structure is comparable to that of villages in Africa.

Correction: Some Gypsies give a bad name to Gypsies. The actions of one minority shouldn't be the benchmark for judging an entire culture, in much the same way that if one person commits a crime, you don't automatically blacklist everyone of the same demographic.

I do concede that certain individuals, especially in regards to Dale Farm, are shooting themselves in the foot with their behaviour, but let's be fair. There are tossers in every segment of society, it's not a trait unique to travellers.
