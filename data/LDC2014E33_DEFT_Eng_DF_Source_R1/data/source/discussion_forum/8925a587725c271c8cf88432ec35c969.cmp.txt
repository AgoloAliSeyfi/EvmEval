I find this fascinating. Obama's approval ratings are hovering below 50%, yet he has made the list for the 4th year in a row. To me, this says that Americans are willing to give Obama the benefit of the doubt in 2012. Once his re-election campaign is in full gear, his accomplishments will come into the light (his failures have been made all too apparent by Fox News.)

Perhaps they are starting to realize that the president isn't a cure-all for a damaged economy. They understand that that there are many other factors to be considered (i.e. the politics of Congress).

That, of course, is just my opinion.

I would be willing to bet if the question was "Which politician is your least favorite" Obama would be close to the top.

Hillary was polled as the most admired woman in America several years ago, around the same time 51% of voters said they would never vote for her.

What does that prove???

It mostly has to do with name recognition and media coverage.

And an opinion based on very little meaningful analysis it is.

The poll asked about 1000 people who they admired the most: About 170 said "Obama."

That means 830 admired someone ELSE.

Gee.....what outstanding.....

See that dot way up there in the sky? It's my point, sailing over your head.

</quote>

Oh, I got your point.

Out of that list, they picked the best.

</quote>

Try to pay attention:

The respondents to the poll were not given a list.

They were simply asked to name whoever thay admired the most:

<quote>
What man that you have heard or read about, living today in any part of the world, do you admire most? And who is your second choice?

</quote>

Almost 40% chose someone that didn't even accumulate 10 votes (their dog, their cat, their dildo.... whatever).

Most interesting to me was that the 2011 poll had the highest number or respondents say, "None" during the past decade...32%.
