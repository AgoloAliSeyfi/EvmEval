@georgeob1,

I agree with that, but the whole thing isn't coming up because Democrats are pointing out the problem; it's because some Republicans have been pointing out the problem, in public.

The problem doesn't consist of these people deciding to vote for Obama - that's not likely to happen - but in not being motivated to come vote at all. We saw some of that with McCain last cycle; he just didn't have what it took to get enough Republican voters out to the polls in key states. This in turn led to large victories down-ticket for the Dems. The Republicans can't afford to have another candidate in 2012 who doesn't get the base excited or they risk a repeat of the 08 election. But the base itself has become increasingly radicalized over the last couple of years, so tacking that direction risks alienating the moderates that are needed to win. This is difficult enough financially, when you add in the social issues it gets really complicated.

It's been my experience - and this may be just my opinion and not that of others - but social and religious Republicans don't seem to care much about the realities of electoral politics. When you reduce social policy decisions to biblical black-and-white terms, there's never any 'accept and move on.' It becomes difficult for these folks to reconcile the reality of the world they live in with the decisions their elected leaders take, and that leads to a great deal of apathy over time.

I'm not exactly upset over this development as it probably bodes well for my preferred side in the future. I wanted to discuss this because I believe what we are looking at here is one of the biggest issues that the Republican nominee is going to face in '12.

@ehBeth,

At least this time the rank hypocrisy seems to point to some benefits.

Nate Silver of Fivethirtyeight has an amusing - and very colorful - graph of the 2012 Republican Presidential field. It can be found on the NY Times website.
I hope someone can link it for us.
Thanks.
