Republican Worship of Greed

</quote>

Democrats want their precious government to track, control and redistribute every dollar in our economy, and it's "Republicans" who are greedy....

We always hear about the redistrubution of wealth from the right but FACTS clearly show that there has been a redistribution of wealth upwards for decades. Funny how some folks on the right ignore that fact. Like good little sheep, they willingly move along to the slaughter of America's core, Main Street America.

Chart 1, represents the redistribution of icome.
Chart 2, represents the decline of the working classes share of the National Income. The "working class" represents a huge majority of Americans.

Mitt Romney represents everything that is kind of wrong with the GOP today. It's the kind of self defeating mentality of a coyote who chews off three legs and is still caught in the trap.

Let's talk about what makes the GOP admirable. It is a party of limited government, self-reliance and freedom to persue happiness. Absolutely good traits.

But the firewall against creeping European Socialism is a strong middle class with skin in the game. One that can have pride in bringing home a paycheck.

A middle class, unfortunately, the Mitt Romneys of the world have been doing their very best to dismantle. Get rid of that good paying union job at AmPad, move that good paying job at DDi to China, make bigger profits for your investors. We'll replace them with McJobs at Staples and Dominos Pizza that pay minimum wage and have no benefits.

When you take away the ability of working people to make good money, when they require food stamps and school lunches to feed their kids, when they need section 8 vouchers to put a roof over their head, when they need a Earned Income Credit to make up for the money they aren't earning at their jobs at Staples, when they have to apply for Medicaid to see a doctor, or rely on Social Security because they sharks on Wall Street made a killing manipulating the market while they were locked into crashing 401K's.

When you do these things, you create more dependence on Government. You make it more palatable for people, and they are more inclined to vote for Democrats. Oh, you can fool some of them by creating upset about guns or gays or abortion or affirmative action, for a while, but eventually they figure it out.

If our politics today has become a choice between big business and big government, you don't want to make big government more attractive. But they are doing exactly that.

Every time Joe says " Ampad," David Axelrod pays Joe $1.

In this post, Joe earned $1.

Yet you propose massive government intervention to solve what you see as the problem.

And you call yourself a Republican.

Go figure.
