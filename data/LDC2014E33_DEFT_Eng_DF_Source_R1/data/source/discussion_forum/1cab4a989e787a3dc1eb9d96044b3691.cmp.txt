The Democrat party has always fought for the working man &amp; woman.

Always? The Democrat party was also the party that fought for slavery. Of course, they didn't think slaves were actually humans, so you may still be correct in your statement.

Actually, Medicare itself is the biggest contributor to our debt. The wars certainly don't help our financial situation but you do realize the your Democrat president has started a few wars of his own, all unfunded and undeclared by Congress?

The Bush tax cuts should have been repealed to help pay and we wouldn't be in this mess

</quote>

Actually,tax revenues as a percentage of GDP changes very little over time, even as marginal tax rates vary widely. There is no evidence to suggest that if we had higher tax rates (no "Bush tax cuts") that we would have realized more actual revenue. In fact, a strong case can be made that we have realized more revenue do to those cuts. Either scenario is difficult to prove but we certainly know that your statement cannot be proven. And by the way, you do understand that Bush cut taxes for all Americans, not just the wealthy, right?

The last two points are just flat wrong and we all know it but I have a question for all the pubs/bags -

Why do you think using ancient history is germane to your modern day point?

Pretty dumb, actually.

Ah, the smart guy shares his superior intellect! Yet he offers NOTHING to support his points. Interesting.

Wrong.

I have no idea why the facts are so hard for con-wanabes to understand, but here it is again. There's even a nice picture for you to look at.

Ah, the dumb guy offers nothing to support his position because he can't.

Are you going to answer my question or are you going to blow smoke?

Never mind. I know you won't because you can't and I've got to leave anyway.

Enjoy the PROOF I posted in my link. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/badgrin.gif"/>

Oh that's rich! I love it! You link to a PREDICTION of deficits in the decades to come. Let's deal with reality, shall we? For 2010, the largest budget items broke down as follows:
20% Defense and Security
20% Social Security
14% Safety Net Programs
...and look at this 21% for Medicare, Medicade and CHIP.

Looks like we spend more on Medicare than anything else. Ergo, that's the program that most contributes to debt.

Really not that hard to understand...

Still waiting for that proof.

Regarding the past as an indicator of what we might expect in the future, I choose to understand history. You are free to repeat it.

You got Obama down pat. Its all Bushs fault. Youre a true idiot if you think Obama is for the working people while he is in a 4 million dollar house in HI
