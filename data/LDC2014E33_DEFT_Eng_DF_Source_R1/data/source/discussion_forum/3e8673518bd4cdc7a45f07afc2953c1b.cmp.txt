This just shows that even when he apologizes it's never enough.

Rush didn't give them the exact words they wanted in his apology.

He had to say they were right to claim that we're trying to prevent this woman from getting BC.

He had to say that he was a filthy pig and that he was quitting.

They don't want him on the air. That is the purpose of their self-righteous indignation.

Not me. I want him on the air as much as possible.

I want him to be free to say as much, as foul, as nasty as he wants it to be.

I wish he had a bigger blowhorn so that even more Americans could hear him.

Nothing would be better.

Unfortunately the left won't allow that. They know that if he is then more people will start thinking like he does. They can't have that.

So, the drug addled gasbag apologized for calling her a slut, but not for lying about her testimony in the first place. Not much of an apology.

Where does Rushbo's apology leave O'Reilly? O'Reilly defended the tub of goo and even went so far as to say Rush's 2nd favorite drug, Viagra, should be carried on insurance plans, but contraception should not.

Rush Limbaugh has the freedom and absolute right to present his commentary point of view, as polarizing and confronting as some of his statements may be. That's part of the First Ammendment right we have, no one has the right to silence him, especially when we have the likes of Howard Stern and Jeneane Garofalo to contend with.

I don't think so. I'm firmly in the "give 'em enough rope" camp.

Your scenario only works if you think people are as racist, sexist, hateful, misogynistic and bigoted as that dirtbag is.

Fortunately, most of America is not. Retrograde social cons think it is, but it's not.

Limbaugh is the best advertisement for liberals and moderates.
