First of all you grouped socialists and the Labour party in one massive group. Hardly given that Labour aren't really socialist in any sense of the word.

Second of all you say that Labour left us with a massive deficit, which they did, but do you know why? Labour more or less had to spend these ludicrous amounts to prop up the economy. Consumer spending plummeted so to stop us from going into an even bigger mess they massively increased government spending, and to a degree it worked, and the recession wasn't as bad as it was in many other countries (Note that the Tories opposed this).

It's also worth noting that before the recession, the deficit was actually lower than when they inherited it, so in other words had the recession not happened we would have a smaller deficit than the one the Tories left us with in 1997, which proves that Labour weren't spending recklessly before the recession hit, contrary to popular opinion.

So please stop with ridiculous with the ridiculous generalizations, tah.

The recession lasted longer than any other G20 country and all this labour spending was totally unneccesary. Is giving 75% of senior civil servants a bonus in 09 a great idea at the depth of recession and a balooning defecit? Labour never cared about thrift, and we're all going to pay for it now.

The more important question: do the Tory voters feel guilty for screwing over thousands of students, cutting **** loads of money from public services whilst lining the pockets of the exuberantly rich?

Thanks.

And when did that happen?

Labour voters would feel proud that the party they voted for staved off a depression by injecting money into the economy, not to mention the succesful sure start program for example, and increased spending. We don't actually need spending cuts, if we kept spending the same, no public sector job losses would mean lower unemployment and as the economy recovers we could have more tax revenues and the deficit would slowly disappear. This was Labour's plan until the Tories came along and screwed it up. I just feel bad that the Tories are about short term economic ideas that will kill the economy in the long run - Labour are the ones who help the economy in the long run. (Think - how does putting more people on the dole help cut the deficit)

Its really strange why Conservative voters don't feel even a bit of shame at the way they've ruined Labour's plan to get the country going again and are ruining Britain? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/confused.gif" alt=":confused:"/> I didn't think they were as heartless as they were made out to be but I think they actually may be <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/>

Total fail. We have a structural defecit, which means debt rises even as the economy grows. Labour were going to make cuts. As for your point about the tories plan you cannot make judgements yet, third quarter growth was higher than anticpated, 4th quarter was lower, the spending cuts haven't begun yet so you can't blame the growth figures on cuts.
