That's kinda the point of this topic. If the military gets the same benefits for less pay than a civilian, with the chance of being shot at and multiple long tours overseas in some real shitholes, there is no real reason to join the military.

This will affect our military readiness.

I can't tell you how many times I would fantasize about a Pizza Hut pizza or a Whopper with cheese. I would also fantasize about hitting some blacktop back in the states and just doing some night driving. Just moving on down the highway on a smooth road. Or sleeping on a real bed. Or taking a shower, alone. Without shower shoes. With clean water. And no stench in the air. In silence. With as much hot water as I can stand.

People have no clue how good we have it here.

Or showering without hearing someone taking a crap. Or trying to hurry to the shower tent that doesn't have the mold. Or walking out of the shower into the sandstorm asking yourself why didnt I just use the baby wipes. And my personal favorite being home and not having to walk around with the coon eyes from sitting in a turret with G14 classified goggles on all day.

Heh. I don't think I'd been retired for six months when I was at a friend's house party, and some guy started bitching that when he had gone to 7-Eleven at three in the morning they were out of cherry Slurpee.

I nearly popped the bastard. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

I remember where 7-Eleven got it's name. Back when the grocery stores closed down by 8 or 9pm.

I don't know what that's supposed to imply, but if you have something to say about Vietnam vets, there are at least three of us right here in this thread, so don't be shy; go ahead and tell us how you feel-it will not be anything we have not heard before, I'm sure.....

You are the kind of stupid that there is no coming back from. VA benefits aren't a hand out, they are not welfare, they are earned from time in combat and time in service. You know, fight for the country boom truck hit by an ied wow 200 a month few more times I might have a decent check on my hand.

</quote>

before 911 -

most every vet I know never saw a day of combat in their lives.

most every vet I met over a certain age, went into the military as a last resort...they were criminals and bums. they got paid and became criminals and bums on leaving military.

then some VA counselor shows up and tells people how to scam the system. just ask any honest vet. It's an open secret

</quote>

I'm an honest vet. I asked myself, and I told me that you're full of shit.

</quote>

why can't vets tell the truth? everyone knows about the VA social workers and other pimps/counselors who do everything to change service discharges/upgrades and who bend every rule to sign up every one they can.

every little thing gets parsed as service related. got a drinking problem? service related. drug problem? service related. beat the wife and kids? service related. can't function on a job? service related...

fuck. World War II vets and Korean War vets went back into society and worked instead of went cuccko-4-benefits

We lost people close to us in the Vietnam war. I also know the criminals who went to serve who scammed the system when out.

Lee Harvey Oswald was a US Marine veteran - vet are no better than anyone else. benefit scams exist in ALL federal programs

We are going back into society and working too. You are an idiot if you think we can live off of the retirement check. most of your WW2 and Nam vets weren't lifers hence no retirement benefits.
