The 9/11 Commission encounter another truther, <a href="http://media.nara.gov/9-11/MFR/t-0148-911MFR-00663.pdf">Dave Klotzman</a> :

<quote>
On July 26, 2004, Commission staffer Graham Giusti advised Commission staffer
Marco A. Cordero that an individual identified as Dave Klotzman, telephone number
(xxx) xxx-xxxx had been contacting Commission staffer Al Felzenberg telephonically,
leaving messages which contained vicious anti Semitic epithets. Guisti asked Cordero to
contact Klotzman to ascertain whether he had any information of interest which he
wanted to pass on to the Commission.

On July 26, 2004, Cordero called Mr. Klotzman's telephone number and an
answering machine picked up. Cordero did not leave a message, deciding it would be
best to speak directly to Mr. Klotzman. Upon hanging up, Mr. Klotzman returned
Cordero's phone call. Cordero identified himself to Mr. Klotzman and told him he was
calling on behalf of the Commission and in response to his messages to Felzenberg. Mr.
Klotzman advised that he had been attempting to contact someone from team 8. Mr.
Klotzman advised that-he had begun to read the Commission's report and was
disappointed to notice that the Commission had continuedto "cover up" the real issues.
Mr. Klotzman stated that he had provided Felzenberg with information which suggested
the Pentagon was initially struck by a missile and later crashed into by the fighter jet
which shot the missile. Cordero advised Mr. Klotzman that the Commission had
previously received very similar information. Mr. Klotzman advised that he did not
believe the Commission had adequately complied with its mandate ifit refused to
consider the missile attack. Cordero advised him that the Commission had reviewed
countless-documents to complete its work and that the report reflected the Commission's
findings. Mr. Klotzman advised the book was incorrect and demanded to speak to
someone who could answer his questions, specifically someone from team 8 because he
knew issues were ignored. Cordero advised him that he would be unable to speak to
anyone from team 8 and he would also not be allowed to see the investigative reports
which were used to draft the Commission's report. Cordero asked Mr. Klotzman to use
more diplomacy and restraint when contacting Felzenberg as Felzenberg and the
Commission receive numerous phone calls from countless citizens. Mr. Klotzman
advised that he would be more diplomatic when contacting the Commission staff. Phone
call lasted approximately 26 minutes.

One or two people have said there's a minor mystery in a report of a 9/11 fire at the White House, or more specifically the Old Executive Office Building. It's always made more sense that this was a mistake, though, people not recognising where the Pentagon smoke was coming from, and that's an interpretation that <a href="http://media.nara.gov/9-11/MFR/t-0148-911MFR-00678.pdf">George Lannon of the State Department</a> shares:

<quote>
Lannon was in Washington on 9-11 and acting in Mk's absence. He had a T.V. on and saw one of the planes hit the WTC live. He went upstairs to the moming meeting. Then, they saw smoke on a camera and thought it was coming from the OEOB (it was a camera angle picking up the Pentagon smoke). The building was ordered evacuated around 10 a.m.

<a href="http://media.nara.gov/9-11/MFR/t-0148-911MFR-00681.pdf">The investigative report on what the hijackers did in Las Vegas</a> is interesting, even if they don't come up with any answers.

Some interesting snippets from the <a href="http://media.nara.gov/9-11/MFR/t-0148-911MFR-00689.pdf">Commission site visit to Logan</a> :

<quote>
Kinton described that ATTA's car was found because after the attacks a citizen called to report an encounter he had with the hijackers in the airport parking garage that morning. Apparently one of the hijackers opened his car door and hit the citizen's car. The citizen then opened his car door and purposely let it hit the hijackers' car. He reported how odd it was that they just sat in the car and didn't react to his provocation. This report helped identify the car and the evidentiary material found inside. The FBI interviewed the informant...

On 9-11 there were no surveillance cameras at the checkpoint or in the terminal.
Cameras have since been deployed...

The briefers pointed out that it took exceptional weather for the hijackers to pull off what they did. They could not have executed the plot if the weather were cloudy or visibility poor.

Bizarre testimony by <a href="http://media.nara.gov/9-11/MFR/t-0148-911MFR-00691.pdf">Lee Longmire of the TSA</a> :

<quote>
Longmire recalled that Monte Belger was Acting Administrator that morning because Administrator Garvey was away from the building. Most of Longmire's dealings with senior officials on 9/11 were with Belger and Lynne Osmus. As indicated previously,
Belger came to the Command Center between the crashes of Flights AAL #11 and VAL
#175. Ms. Garvey returned to the FAA building shortly thereafter, with Secretary
Mineta.

</quote>
Garvey came to the FAA HQ with Mineta? Perhaps he said/ meant Garvey had been with Mineta, and this got misinterpreted.

Poor Mr Cordero, that phone call was 26 minutes of his life wasted that he'll never get back.
