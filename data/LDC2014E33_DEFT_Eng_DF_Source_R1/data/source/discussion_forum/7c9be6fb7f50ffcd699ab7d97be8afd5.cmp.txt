Claim: Colin Powell talked about the "Mobile biological weapons laboratories". Proffered in the absence of any real laboratories in the wake of the invasion, photos of these trailers were shown on all the US Mainstream Media, with the claim they while seeming to lack anything suggesting biological processing, these were part of a much larger assembly of multiple trailers that churned out biological weapons of mass destruction.

<a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/IMAGES/ballontrailer.jpg">http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/IM...lontrailer.jpg</a>
FACT: Later it was revealed that these trailers were nothing more than hydrogen gas generators used to inflate weather balloons. This fact was already known to both the US and UK, as a British company manufactured the units and sold them to Iraq.

Claim: Powell claimed that Iraq had purchased special aluminum tubes whose only possible use was in uranium enrichment centrifuges.
FACT: Both CIA and Powell's own State Department confirmed that the tubes were parts for missiles Saddam was legally allowed to have. Following the invasion, no centrifuges, aluminum or otherwise were found.

Claim: Powell claimed to the United Nations that <a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/IMAGES/13-350h.jpg">this photo</a> showed "Decontamination Vehicles".
FACT: When United Nations inspectors visited the site after the invasion, they located the vehicles and discovered they were just firefighting equipment

Claim: Powell claimed the Iraqis had illegal rockets and launchers hidden in the palm trees of Western Iraq.
FACT: None were ever found or used.

Claim: Powell claimed that the Iraqis had 8,500 liters (2245 gallons) of Anthrax.
FACT: None was ever found or used.

Claim: Powell claimed that Iraq had four tons of VX nerve gas.
FACT: The UN had already confirmed that it was destroyed. The only VX ever found were samples the US had left as "standards" for testing. When the UN suspected that the US samples had been used to contaminate Iraqi warheads, the US moved quickly to destroy the samples before comparison tests could be carried out. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/404896.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/404896.stm</a>

Claim: Powell claimed that Iraq was building long-range remote drones specifically designed to carry biological weapons.
FACT: The only drones found were short-range reconnaissance drones

Claim: Powell claimed that Iraq had an aggregate of between 100 and 500 tons of chemical and biological warfare agents. Powell gave no basis for that claim at all,
FACT: a DIA report issued the same time directly contradicted the claim. No biological or chemical weapons were found in Iraq following the invasion.

Claim: Powell claimed that "unnamed sources" confirmed that Saddam had authorized his field commanders to use biological weapons.
FACT: No such weapons were ever used by the Iraqis to defend against the invasion and, of course, none were ever found in Iraq.

Claim: Powell claimed that 122mm warheads found by the UN inspectors were chemical weapons.
FACT: The warheads were empty, and showed no signs of ever having contained chemical weapons.

Claim: Powell claimed that Iraq had a secret force of illegal long-range Scud missiles.
FACT: None were ever found or used

Claim: Powell claimed to have an audio tape proving that Saddam was supporting Osama Bin Laden.
FACT: Independent translation of the tape revealed Osama's wish for Saddam's death.

Claim: Colin Powell's UN debacle also included spy photos taken from high flying aircraft and spacecraft. On the photos were circles and arrows and labels pointing to various fuzzy white blobs and identifying them as laboratories and storage areas for Saddam's massive weapons of mass destruction program. <a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/IMAGES/taji_sites_shrunk.jpg">http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/IM...tes_shrunk.jpg</a>
FACT: Nothing in the photos actually suggested what the blobby shapes were and inspections which followed the invasion, all of them turned out to be rather benign.

The situation is more like: "Was Colin Powell lied to".

Most of the misinformation disseminated by the Bush Administration came from an Iraqi expatriate named Ahmad Chalabi. They paid him over $30 million.

He told the the administration what they wanted to hear. Cheney and Rumsfeld were chomping at the bit for a reason to invade Iraq so they conveniently never bothered to check out the validity of Mr. Chalabi's information.

Mr. Chalabi sit directly behind Mrs Bush during the last state of the union address. Mr. Chalabi was later arrested in Iraq.

I thought he was just being a good company man, but couldn't wait to resign. However, in a recent interview he was still defending the Bush adminstration. After that I completely lost respect for him, and he has lost credibility along with the rest of them.

I think Powell will write another book as soon as Bush leaves office. The current administration can make life difficult for a former senior cabinet member who tells the truth.
At least that is my hope. It is possible that Powell sold his soul to the devil like the rest of them.

Powell seems to have sold out but you may be right. Once the disaster finally ends he may speak out.
