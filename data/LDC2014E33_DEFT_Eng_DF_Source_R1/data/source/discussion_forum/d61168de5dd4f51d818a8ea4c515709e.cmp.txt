i have been following this post due to the situation i found myself in.

Bit of background

Going through a divorce
3 children

I had been with my husband for over 20+ years when end of last year, he announced he dont love me know more and was leaving. he didnt leave that night as he didnt know how to tell the children. about a week later the phone bill arrived and there was a number i didnt recognised that he had been contacting from the time he got up till the time WE went to bed, for months. When i confronted him he told me it was a woman from work who was a close friend. he told the children and left that night.

He moved into his parents and within a few weeks he was sleeping with her. At first i had the support of his parents but that soon diminished. As obv they stood by their son.

Roll on too now. i cant describe to you the hurt and humiliation that you feel. that everyone knew and was laughing at you, to watch my children crumble before your very eyes, the man they used to look at with such admiration they look at with contempt. i dont slag him off in front of the children or refuse to allow him contact. he chooses not to see them unless he can be bothered. to listen to your kids crying at night as they have been replaced by her children. Yes he is still with her. Are they happy i have no clue.

He tells the children he lives with his parents and his parent keep this up he infact stays over every night at her house. The children do not want to meet her under any circumstances. so he has to live a lie im not sure if the kids will ever meet her or be told the truth as to where he his living.

We have lost family members that we were very close to how can those trelationships ever be put right. I try my best to keep going and hold my head up high and keep letting the kids know that they are loved. but you end up living on your nerves as you are never quite sure whats going to be thrown at you next.

My husband had never been unfaithful before she knew he was married with children as she had met us. I suspect he has told her he was unhappy etc. Maybe he was BUT we were still intimate right up until he left (do you think he told her that). We had plans for the future and were discussing how to make those plans a reality. So for all you know he could be doing the same to his wife. I was totally devasted and to some extent still am. Would i have believed that he was capable of causing so much hurt and devastation. Never. He is now not the man i was with for all of those years i dont even recognise him or his actions. It makes you wonder if the whole of your life has been 1 big lie.

So yes his wife has the right to know i wish someone had told me that he was flirting with someone else whilst making promises to me. then i wouldnt have felt that he had ripped my heart out of my chest and stamped on it. I would have been prepared for the whole of my life and my kids lives to be turned upside down but most of all i would have had a choice in the outcome.

Purpletoenails - read that post above and really take in the pain this ALWAYS causes and be ashamed of yourself.
A married man is out of bounds and YOU should have walked away double quick, NO excuses.
Women like you disgust me.

and I know this because my ex ripped my heart out the day I gave birth to our beautiful little girl. He moved out and in with her whilst I was in hospital. Roll on nearly 10 years and they got married, had a baby and now he has done exactly the same to her and is living with the next victim.
Be warned...

(and I think I'll duck now before I get shot down in flames!!)

If he didn't leave pretty much immediately, he probably won't at all.

I agree with this. It also has to be his choice to leave.

The relationship can work out and often does. Its the reason the marriage is unhappy that needs to be addressed or there is a good chance of repeating the same problems and being unhappy all over again.

Yes it can, no denying that, but people get hurt as a result of affairs.

people get hurt for all sorts of reasons and my experience is genuine people dont embark on an affair in a foolhardy fashion it is done with care and consideration of everyone involved. They slip into it and dont run into it and it happens because they are not happy in their marriage. Some people look to repairing the marriage and some people cant. Blame doesnt help.
