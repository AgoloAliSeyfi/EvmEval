When AIDS first appeared it was spread by gay men amongst each other. Then it spread to straight people via bisexual sex and shared needles. Today many more straight people than gays have HIV/AIDS.

All are unhealthy lifestyles.

When AIDS first appeared it was contracted by heterosexuals and transferred between heterosexuals before spreading to homosexuals. When HIV first appeared as a mutation of SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus, confirmed through DNA Testing) and passed to humans it is believe either through consumption of raw/undercooked meat or through blood exposure to a wound when humans hunted the animals.

The majority of HIV infections have been because of heterosexual relations.

HIV neither "appeared" in gay men nor have the majority of the cases in the world been spread by gay men.

*******************************

BTW you skipped these questions:
1. So you are cool with lesbians getting a Civil Marriage because they have the lowest incidence of HIV infection? (Or is it just homosexual males you have an issue with [which takes it back to being gender specific].)

2. Would you support HIV testing as part of Civil Marriage requirements for all participants and the refusal of a license if an individual tests positive for HIV? (Or is it just homosexual males you have an issue with [which takes it back to being gender specific].) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

What has HIV got to do with marriage? Nothing that's what.

I was talking about all unhealthy lifestyles.

I was referring to when it started in America.

Marriage helps prevent the spread of HIV by encouraging monogamous relationships

How does what some perceive to be a civil right have anything to do with the rule of law? Nobody has a right to marry, period, it is not in the constitution, therefore states have always handled marriage and marriage laws. It doesn't matter if it's gay marriage or not, it simply is not a right, and that wont change by calling it a civil right or a human right or blah blah blah. Just because you change the terminology does not mean it changes the law as it is written.
If people want gay marriage, then get out the vote and have people vote it in.

So you disagree with the SCOTUS ruling that struck down State laws on interracial Civil Marriage because even though the 14th Amendment required Due Process and Equal Protection under the law, that didn't apply to colored people?

BTW - All citizens have a right to equal treatment under the law barring a compelling government interest and if they feel they have been wronged by the government they have a Constitutional right to address such grievances through the courts.

Yep, when you think about Civil Marriage promoting monogamous relationships*** then it actually become an argument FOR allowing Sames-sex Civil Marriage.

*** If you don't think Civil Marriage promotes monogamy, then ask someone whose been cause cheating on his/her spouse and how they got taken to the cleaners in the divorce.

I've always been a critic of judges who decide they are going to disregard the will of legistlatures and the populace and impose these things, but here's a case where they did it the right way, they passed a bill, and Christie the Hutt decides he's stull sucking up to be RomBot's running mate.

Lol, I agree with Christie on this one, though Ithink he did it purely for politidcal gain and not because it was the right thing to do.

He did the right thing, it is up to the people to decide, not for the state government to dictate.

Then you are a statist conservative progressive: you support mass democracy, not representative republicanism.
