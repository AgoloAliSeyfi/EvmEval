No it probably wouldn't be over... but this has nothing to do with BUSH... why are you talking about BUSH? He isn't our president and he isn't the one making STUPID decisions...

why-does-barack-obama-suck-ill-give-you-10-good-reasons

Note: Barack Obama has an IQ of 125. Are you smarter than him? Take this IQ test and find out!

I dont know how many times Ive heard the words Obama and Messiah used in the same sentence. To liberals, Barack Obama is a spotless god-like figure who will save America from the scourge of neo-conservatism. Im totally sick of hearing and reading your hero-worshiping crap, folks. Lets face reality: like so many other powerful politicians in this country, Barack Obama sucks:

1. The Race Card: Whether it be in suggesting that anyone who doesnt vote for him because he is black is probably a republican, or in blaming Bush administration racism on a slow response to Hurricane Katrina, Obama is quite comfortable playing the race card. AND ITS FUNNY CUZ HES HALF WHITE

2. Anti-Indian: After the Obama campaign released a paper disparaging other candidates for their ties to the Indian-American community, the chairman of the bipartisan US India Political Action Committee, Sanjay Puri, stated that the Obama Campaign was engaging in the worst kind of anti-Indian American stereotyping. Of course, Obama denied any hand in the racist document put out by his campaign.

3. Corrupt Buddies: Tony Rezko, a long time friend and fund-raiser for Obama, was indicted last fall on federal charges that accuse him of demanding kickbacks from companies seeking state business. When asked about his friend, Obama said, Ive never done any favors for him. This turned out to be a lie, as evidence turned up proving that Obama had written letters to city and state officials praising Rezkos business practices.

4. Wal-Mart Ties: While bashing of Wal-Marts labor practices in public, Obama has been profiting from their business through the money his wife made as a member of the board of directors for a company that produces food for the mega-corporation.

5. Religious Ties: Is Obama a Muslim? Is he a Christian? Nobody is 100% sure, but it is true that Obama was raised in a Muslim family and at one time attended an Islamic school. He currently claims to be a convert to Christianity, but some are concerned about his Muslim upbringing.

6. Anti-Second Amendment: Obama is one of the most anti-Second Amendment legislators in the country. He supports a ban the sale or transfer of all forms of semi-automatic weapons.

7. Gas-guzzler: Obama might attack American automakers for not making enough environmental friendly automobiles, but when he goes home he drives a gas-guzzling V-8 hemi-powered Chrysler 300.

8. Obama Ringtones: The most annoying campaign tool ever.

9. Obama Girl: I take back what I said about the ringtones. This girl is far more annoying.

10. His Unelectable Name: Barack Hussein Obama, nuff said.

Oh, and another thing, since when is it a good idea to make our president, the LEADER, of our country the same status as a celebrity?

Seriously, remember not long after he was elected and all the Obama merchandise came out?

There were Obama shoes, T-shirts, etc. WTF? The guy is "supposed" to be the leader of our country, not a Golden Globe contender.

It's funny how everyone always says what you just said but when had the chance to vote for McCain; didn't. Bush made a mess out of everything and no one wanted another republican in the white house so they had no other choice than to vote for Obama. Obama cannot fix everything that Bush did in 1 year. How about we let the man do his job for the next 3 years and then critize (sp?) him. Yes I voted for Obama; not because he's black or 1/2 black but because he was the better choice (please do not speak for the "BLACK COMMUNITY). There were more white than blacks that voted for Obama. Obama did not start the war, Bush did. If were to pull all the troops out and all hell broke loose it would be his fault too. The man cannot win in some peoples eyes.

As far as the topic at hand; at the end of the day it would be between that woman and her GOD. Who are we to judge.
