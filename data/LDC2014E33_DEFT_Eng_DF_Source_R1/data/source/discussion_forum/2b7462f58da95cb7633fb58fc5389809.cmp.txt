Tiff- in order to become a citizen you actually have to be living here and paying bills legally by acquiring a visa when you enter the country. There is no catch 22.
If your visa is up- you apply for an extension.

Answered in a different post.

And the constitution was written as a reflection of the Declaration of Independence from foreign powers. Not to protect non- Americans. That was its intent.

Thousands of Law Students and Law professors as well as attorneys, judges would disagree with you. As well as my constitutional Law class. Except for the privileges and immunities clauses, the Constitution protects people and persons, not merely citizens, and the Founders never said otherwise. They knew the difference between "citizens" and "persons" and they chose their words purposely. The constitution is to detailed to skimp on words. I've read it and studied it

And the law isn't racist because it is written for Mexican's living in Arizona. An illegal immigrant from China living in Arizona will be prosecuted and deported in the same manner. It is not to target anyone. If the law were in NY- I'm sure the majority of illegals would be from Eastern Europe and Asia. Its coincidence that the population of illegal Mexican immigrants is higher and that that is the first state to want to adopt the bill.

The thought behind it being racist has several view points. Not all of which I'm familiar with. But there is no coincidence that the law will only effect one target group. They knew it would when they wrote it. My number one question is what happens when a legal Mexican gets deported, harassed or detained because they forgot their papers at home? What about their rights? This is going back to Nazi Germany when the Jews had to carrie papers.... extreme example but same point.

The law does not violate human rights either. The UCR does not account for why a person does or does not report the crime. It is a statistical measure based on fact not reasoning. This is an assumption that they are to scared to report crimes for fear of deportation. But they are committing a crime themselves. I'm sure a man with a warrant out for his 8 unpaid parking tickets is less likely to report a crime as well. This is an assumption and correlation.
Violating human rights includes many things on a spectrum from torture to kidnapping. Sending them back to the country of origin because they are committing a crime in our country by being here illegally is definitely not a violation of human rights.

While the UCR doesn't account for why, common sense does. Would do call the police if someone broke into your house and raped you if you where scared of deportation? This article is a good read and has many valid points.

Also where are we going to get the money to send them all back? On the other thread we talked about costs. It will cost more to send them all back then we spend keeping them here.....

I just think this law is the wrong way to go about the 'right' thing. <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

You have no idea the process to come here Legally do you? <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/>

I have an idea. I know my friend had to jump through flaming hoops to become legal in Canada. However, if you really want to be an American then deal with how difficult the process is. Nothing EVER is cheap, easy or free in this country. If you don't like it, then don't come here. That's all I have to say. <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/>

What I was trying to say is, one process of becoming legal is to first be here illegally. If you don't like the process blame the government, not the people using the very process created.
