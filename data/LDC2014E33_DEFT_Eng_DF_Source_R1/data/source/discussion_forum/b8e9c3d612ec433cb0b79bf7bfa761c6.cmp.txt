Hiya all -Long posting alert!!!! <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/redface.gif"/>

basically I need to put my thoughts down on paper (or an Internet page!) and hopefully get some thoughts from you all please.

Ok, here goes...

I'm part of a very small family - My Dad (61), Me(28), my DH, my younger sister (23) and her DH. I have 3 kids between 7 and 2, my sister has a daughter aged 10 months. My father has undiagnosed "Learning Difficulties" and anger issues (he attacked me frequently as a child and broke my arm on one occasion). I have had to put the past behind me since my mother died because my father relies so heavily on me to do everyday tasks like paying the gas bill etc (I've since set up direct debits for his bills).

My mother died suddenly 2.5 years ago after a short illness in hospital. My Gran passed away in March this year (Dad's Mum).

My Father inherited my Gran's house, valued at 90K, which he has shared equally between him, my sis and I (30k each).

For the last 2-3 months he has been spending time with a "Lady Friend". She's 44. She's a stark contrast to my late mother in physical and emotional descriptions. I'm the first not to put my mother on a pedestal but she was a loved lady who would walk across the country to help someone if needed. The new lady is disliked by all of my father's acquaintances.

He has been lying to my sister and I about their "relationship", even though we've seen evidence of texts he's sent her "I Love you lots". He has never sent my sister or I a text message, because apparently he doesn't know how to (even though we tried to teach him before) - he went to France a month ago and told us he didn't take his phone - I today found out he was texting this woman 20-30 times each day.

Apparently she has made it known to people she likes the thought of the money (my father has made no secret about the inheritance). I can't help thinking that she's a golddigger.

My father is physically unattractive, aggressive, and he is unable to hold a conversation with you due to his low intelligence (I'm not being mean here, just telling it as it is).

He will be retiring in 3 years (he' still in full time employment as a factory hand) and as I understood it, he wanted to put the money away to look after himself in retirement.

I personally don't care about any future inheritance I could be entitled to (his house etc), I would much rather my father have a good quality life in old age (I'm doing ok for myself financially).

So, I guess that's it. Do I let my Dad possibly get taken for a ride to the cleaners by this woman (who has already been married twice before) and just sit back? Or do I say something to him / her???

I've never met her, but apparently she's not a very nice person who knows how to get what she wants, and my father is obviously flattered to receive attention from this lady, but he doesn't have the social skills to understand other peoples concerns.

Phew, thanks for getting this far!!!!!!!!

Any advice and opinions welcome...

Personally I dont think its anything to do you even if she is a golddigger (no offence). Your father is a grown man and maybe he has heard this as well but if he is really happy where is the harm. Life is too short and you cant take money with you when you pop your clogs. It is his money to spend how he likes anyway.

I think rather than asuming he has undiagnosed learning difficulties you should just accept him as he is or push for a diagnosis if you feel he has them, Some people as just not very bright, doesn't mean they have 'learning difficulties'.

I also agree that its none of your business as such, if he really is incapable of looking after his own purse strings or making his own decision then he would not still be undiagnosed at 50ish.

Its hard to see your parent with another, but i think if it what he wants you just have to accept it, maybe if you met her you might feel different

I can understand where you're coming from. A similar thing happened to a family member. It is difficult to deal with and yes, it is his money, but it was gained from your mother's hard earned cash as well and I wouldn't like the thought of someone else helping themselves.

Perhaps you should just keep your eye on the situation and see how it goes. If you can, express your concerns or maybe gently enquire if he needs help with sorting his finances. You could look for a good interest rate for him and maybe suggest you can sign as well in case of emergencies then you can keep a check. Other than that, I'm afraid there's not much else you can do.

Good luck with it. It's a very difficult thing to have to approach and I really feel for you x
