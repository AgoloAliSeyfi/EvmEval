BEIJING, June 02, 2005 -- Boeing [NYSE: BA] today announced agreements with Chinese suppliers worth an estimated US$600 million for production of commercial airplane parts and components, including the first firm contract with such suppliers to build parts for the all-new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

Boeing Commercial Airplanes Vice President and General Manager, Airplane Production Carolyn Corvi represented Boeing in Beijing to finalize contracts for the 787 composite rudder, the 737 forward entry door and the 737 automatic over-wing exit door with Chengdu Aircraft Industrial (Group) Co. Ltd. (CAC), a China Aviation Industry Corporation I (AVIC I)-affiliated company. Also completed were contracts for the 787 wing-to-body fairing panels between Boeing and Hafei Aviation Industry Co., Ltd. (Hafei), an AVIC II-affiliated company.

Outsourcing is not limited to just items you buy at Wal-Mart.

CHINESE computer spies are suspected of having cracked the Pentagon's $500 billion Joint Strike Fighter program, accessing top-secret files containing details of the aircraft's stealth design and electronics.
Details of the brazen break-in were reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal newspaper, citing current and former US government officials.

The Royal Australian Air Force has placed a tentative order for 100 of the F-35 JSFs for about $16 billion, easily making it Australia's biggest defence purchase.

Last night, Defence confirmed it was aware of the report and was seeking more information. "Defence has seen the US reports and will discuss the issues raised with the JSF Program office in due course," it said in a written response to questions from The Australian.

There are a few things worth mentioning, first the Russian T-50 will not come into production and will do so in limited numbers several years from now around 2017. It's builder Sukhoi has already made a long term commitment to build the SU-35 for the forseeable future and this can be seen by the recent purchases of this aircraft by the Russian Air Force which continues to but and will for several years. India has expressed interest in in the T-50 and has made overtures to Sukhoi to invest in it's development. However there is a new player in the India aircraft needs and that the F-16IN which is a "super cruise" version of the F-16 purpose built for India based on the F-16XL technology and using the F-35 Radar system which is the feature of the F-35 JSF that makes it a worthy aircraft. Otherwise the F-35 is an average 4th generation performer. Nations like Russia,China, and the EU are at or approaching equality in technological terms with the US Military, with the exception of the F-22, which we cancelled at 187 aircraft.

First, UScitizen, there are smart cuts, and there are not so smart cuts, so quit acting stupidly.

What does concern me about this is China's involvement in their space program. This is the unknown factor, that could come back to bite us in a big way. What I'm talking about is a miltary weapon they could develop, and we would be decades behind in nuetralizing the threat. just a thought.....

Neither China nor Russia has any interest in getting an edge on the United States in order to defeat us as an "enemy," which is cold war thinking. In a global economy, where both are strong participants now, they can't afford to.
