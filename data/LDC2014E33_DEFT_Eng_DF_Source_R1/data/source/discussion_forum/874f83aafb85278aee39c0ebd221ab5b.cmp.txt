Aha. Finally.

<a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/files/Katrina%20Matrix.pdf">http://www.citizensforethics.org/fil...a%20Matrix.pdf</a>

Thirty pages. Table listing countries offering aid and assistance after Katrina ( many more than I had found in my above post), and those denied/rejected by the US.

CREWs matrix is based on 25,000 Department of State (DOS) documents it received as a result of a lawsuit filed under the Freedom of Information Act in December 2005 for records relating to the federal governments handling and acceptance of international offers of aid after Hurricane Katrina.

The matrix includes all international offers, whether they were rejected or accepted and the reasons why, if available. The documents reveal a number of disturbing responses to offers from 145 countries and 12 international organizations from around the world.

For example, an email from Jeffrey Goldstein, a U.S. Embassy official in Estonia, to several DOS officials, states:

It is getting downright embarrassing here not to have a response to the Estonians on flood relief. And now I see from the staff meeting notes that the task force may disband soon. We know that what the Estonians can offer is small potatoes and everyone at FEMA is swamped, but at this point even thanks but no thanks is better than deafening silence.

Another email responding to an offer from Argentina to DOS officials reads All, The (sic) word here is that doctors of any kind are in the 'forget about it' category. Human assistance of any kind is not on our priorities list....Its all about goods, not people, at this point.

Another email describes how the transport of Israeli relief supplies loaded on a C-130 aircraft was delayed for over 48 hours on the tarmac while Israeli officials waited for clearance from the U.S. government. The unidentified author states: Ive been on the phone with the [Israeli] attache every couple of hours since noon... theyre patient, but not amused by our delay, obviously. The documents do not reveal if or how the issue was resolved.

Melanie Sloan, CREWs executive director said today, A review of the State Department documents reveals distressing ineptitude. Countries were trying to donate desperately needed goods and services, but as a result of bureaucratic bungling and indifference, those most in need of these generous offers of aid never received it.

After 9/11 there were several new laws governing a host of things related to access to our country. Security had to be the #1 priority...I can understand the delays due to them awaiting clearance from U.S. authorities. No big surprise there....what does surprise me is the fact that only 5% of the cash donated has been spent on the victims and restoring their neighborhoods.

I can understand why some aid was turned down. All of it due to political reasons. Whether that's right or wrong history will judge.

Hardly. Read through that last link ( <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/files/Katrina%20Matrix.pdf">http://www.citizensforethics.org/fil...a%20Matrix.pdf</a> )

(for example) what was the "political reason" for rejecting the Australian's offer of "search and rescue team, emergency managers, disaster rescue and logistics specialists, emergency
assessment team, 3 fire rescue team members and forensic assistants" ?

Did you ever stop to think that we may have already had enough of the rejected items on hand already...and did you ever stop to think about the logistical efforts needed to bring even MORE stuff we already have into the effected area?

Or refusing Austria's "disaster relief team specializing in water purification and decontamination, 10 disaster relief experts, 10 water pumps, 4 person psychological support team, 6 person communication support team, elite police "Cobra" team specializing in protection, 100 troops with technical skills"?

But hey. We did accept their 500 tarps and 300 camp beds =\

You gotta be fucking kidding me.

I've posted enough stuff here proving the Feds screwed the pooch on this (foreign aid).

BTW, the original question was just "WHO" had helped us during Katrina (the implication being, of course, that NO one had). Which, as I've proven, is complete and utter bullshit.

Additionally, the claim was made that "all offers were accepted". Bullshit again.

We didn't accept 400 million dollars in oil from Saudi Arabia. We turned down European troops on American soil. We turned down more oil from the EU. Is that your basis for saying we turned down aid?

Can you imagine what the left would have done if we HAD accepted that oil???

Waaaaaahhhhhhhhh Bush and Cheney stole the oil for their Texas tea party pals waaaaaaaaahhhhhh. Christ almighty...we NEVER would have heard the end of that!!!

I am not saying anyone turned down our help, I am saying some countries offered helped during Katrina and were turned down.

</quote>

I'm going to have to see a link to some credible info on that. From what I understand ALL aid offered was accepted despite Bush's taken out of context remark "We can take care of ourselves."
