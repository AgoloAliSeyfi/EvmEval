The planet is heating up, thanks to human-generated emissions of greenhouse gases. But as a new NOAA-led study,  <a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2009/2009JD012105.shtml">An observationally based energy balance for the Earth since 1950</a>  (subs. reqd, release <a href="http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/prrl/2009-24.html">here</a> ) concluded: [S]ince 1950, the planet released about 20 percent of the warming influence of heat-trapping greenhouse gases to outer space as infrared energy. Volcanic emissions lingering in the stratosphere offset about 20 percent of the heating by bouncing solar radiation back to space before it reached the surface. Cooling from the lower-atmosphere aerosols produced by humans balanced 50 percent of the heating. Only the remaining 10 percent of greenhouse-gas warming actually went into heating the Earth, and almost all of it went into the ocean.
Note that this Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres study was done without using global climate models.

Gotta love interjected op-ed statements from self proclaimed scientists outside their field...most amusing. Too bad they don't back anything up. What next, pejorative comments about Nature I suppose.

Indeed, the best estimate for the changes in the top 700m seems to be a greater warming than seen in the <a href="http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/3M_HEAT_CONTENT/">NODC data</a> and more than even the models were suggesting:

Posted by Ari Jokimäki on September 20, 2010

Newly published research on deep ocean temperatures has found warming during 1990′s and 2000′s. The observed warming is generally stronger in the south and it appears that a large part of the heat in the deep ocean is transferred through the Southern Ocean. The finding is important for global energy budget and for global sea level estimates.

Cross-section from one measurement route. Different colors represent the temperature change.
Earths climate has warmed during recent decades. This is most likely due to top of atmosphere energy imbalance caused by the increases in the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. About 80% of the energy from the imbalance has gone to heating the oceans due to their large heat capacity.
The slow reaction of the oceans to warming also slows the reaction of the surface temperature to the forcing. Even if we would keep greenhouse gases unchanged, the oceans would keep warming for centuries.

Reservoirs: A Neglected Source of Methane Emissions

ScienceDaily (Oct. 11, 2010)  Substantial amounts of the greenhouse gas methane are released not only from large tropical reservoirs but also from run-of-the-river reservoirs in Switzerland, especially in the summer, when water temperatures are higher. This was demonstrated by Eawag scientists at Lake Wohlen, near Bern -- a finding which slightly tarnishes the reputation of hydropower as a climate-neutral way of generating electricity.

Coral Records Show Ocean Thermocline Rise With Global Warming

ScienceDaily (Oct. 13, 2010)  Researchers looking at corals in the western tropical Pacific Ocean have found records linking a profound shift in the depth of the division between warm surface water and colder, deeper water traceable to recent global warming.
The finding is the first real evidence supporting what climate modelers have been predicting as the effects of global climate change on the subsurface ocean circulation.
