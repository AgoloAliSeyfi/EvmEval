Or, alternatively, the audience has sufficient cognitive ability to distinguish an unsupported and unsupportable partisan and crypto-racist rant from a genuine thesis. Tarting up your hatred of whites, and desire to blame them for all of the world's ills with specious references to history, and a Marxian appeal to economics does not make your position logical, nor your estimation of whites just. You have never in this thread, provided a shred of evidence to support your racist contention that most whites believe in white supremacy.

Yes I did present my premise, inference and conclusion very clearly. I even set up a question to be answered that would shed light on your own personal character. Yet, all you all have done is simply disagree, without providing premise, inference and conclusion to prove me wrong, plus your assertions right. Now you are trying to discredit the message via discrediting me and by associating my rhetoric to some communist Marxist philosophy that you feel has already be discredited by the evidence of history. Yet, I am not a proponent of Communism or Marxism as a philosophy. Saying that Capitalism is exploitive and evil, is not the same as saying that I promote communism, socialism or Marxism. You guys are too easy to logically refute with all your logical fallacies as rebuttal.

Actually, what you did is set up a question that you hoped would shed light about your preconceived ideas regarding our character.

Noah, your response to Phoenix's withdrawal has been seen by aggressive jerks on many of these threads. You construe her withdrawal as a retreat. You do so in order to put a good face on your rejection. I too am leaving this thread BECAUSE you are a pompous boor, not worthy, because of your neurotic fixation and dishonest engagement, of further attention.

I would say that is a true statement Cav and if I was correct, one could say that I am perceptive, since your responces fullfilled the preconception.

That's a mighty big if since you can't demonstrate the ability to read what the members post without imagining things that they did not say.

In fact, i very specifically rebutted your statements about a pattern of white supremacy-based exploitation throughout history, and your reply to that was to characterize it as filibustering. You simply will not accept an argument which does not agree with the notions you had already in mind when you came here.

You wrote: "Also, it is not about INTENT...it is about Effect. Who cares what the INTENT of the European explorers were...this is about the EFFECT." This is a direct contradiction of your statment about most white people believing in white supremacy, which would be very definitely a matter of intent, leading to the effect as you allege. You may want to have it both ways, but logically you cannot. My point in reviewing very briefy and in very little detail, the history of European colonization was to demonstrate that no white supremacist intent was present, and it was in response to your contention about a white supremacist majority allegedly existant. When confronted on that contention, you try to change the rules of the debate, claiming that effect is your point and not intent. If that were so from the beginning, what in the context of your rather fluid rules of this debate authorized your statement that most white people believe in white supremacy? That is a racist statement, and you've consistently avoided responsibility for that.

The fundamental requirement for debate is that the person who creates a topic be ready to answer questions posed. It seems you are incapable. End of discussion. I agree with the majority of participants of this forum; his mind has been made up long before he made his first post. He can't see nor are willing to see beyond his own 'blackness.' Kinda sad, because I think he's shown some intelligence in his ability to 'communicate,' but lacks the sensibility to absorb information that he feels contradicts his position. Nobody will change his mind on this topic, here or anywhere else. Nuf said.

Noah
I've been following this thread and I don't think I've ever run across anyone who is as racist as you are!
It must be awful to feel that way and I truly feel sorry for you.
