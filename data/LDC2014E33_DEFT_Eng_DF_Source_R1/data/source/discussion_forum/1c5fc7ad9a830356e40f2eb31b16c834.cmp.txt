Thank you for the link. But that info is from 2007, best I can tell. He may own more now. Or less. But I doubt that he would sell any. It's not like he needs the money.

Wiki is easy enough to update - should the share percentage have changed, I'm sure it would have been included.

The fact remains, you got shown to be a petty moronic whiner who clearly does not bother to fact check information. I do. Which is why I know that it is one Saudi, not 'the saudis'... and it is a mere 7% - hardly a controlling interest.

So, how come you're not accusing sallow of 'pulling' information 'out of his ass'? Because he's a liberal. Unlike myself. I'm a conservative, therefore you challenge my information. You are a dishonest and mindless hack... and a mindnumbingly boring poster.

Two things here:

1 - I thought that in the past, you laughed at WIKI being used as a source.
2 - I thought that in the past, you have claimed not to be a conservative, but an independent.

</quote>

I don't value wiki that highly as a source.... simply because it is open to biased editing and has, on many occasions, been factually inaccurate.

I am independent.... in that I have no allegiance to any political party... I am certainly a fiscal conservative... socially, not so much. That's being independent. Twit.

Fact remains.... and you can research this for yourself... one Saudi currently owns 7% of shares in News Corp. Note: News Corp as a whole, not Fox News. Anyone who claims otherwise is a lying twit.

Too much of the the "fair game" trash got a young man killed.

</quote>

This one I have to disagree with you adamantly on.

What got that young man killed was racist views and a demented man with a chip on his shoulder.

</quote>

That is an opinion, it is not established as fact.

</quote>

An opinion addressing another opinion.

So what...?

if this is a passive aggressive swipe at me, then i ask you to read up on brother minister malcolm-x, because clearly you're sadly and severely mistaken.

However, if it was not to me, then my sincerest apologies.

It is not a BIG news story. You just want to make a race case. There are whites killed all the time in the inner city !

I watch FNC 3-6 hours daily, an it appears to me that story is getting as much coverage as any other including that of the terrorist in France. You, Marc, don't know that of which you post.

Btw it's not a white on black crime; the shooter is Hispanic and has blacks in his immediate family.

This one is trying hard, but can't seem to spin and twist herself out of a wet paper bag to save her partisan life.

I sure as hell know ZIMMERMAN has no civil rights complaint. Kid gloves for a guy who just shot someone else to death. Even police have to take time off work, not Zimmerman, he's suddenly the VICTIM.

</quote>

Who said Zimmerman is a victim? Other than you, of course.

</quote>

Discussing his injuries, how the killing "went down" indicates the killer is now the VICTIM.

</quote>

Really? He's a victim to you.

Who knew?

Regardless, what she said stands. A single person's 7% interest in an entity does not equate to it being state run.

Well, at least in this dimension.

7% shareholder..... and you're seriously gonna continue to pretend he 'runs' FNC? Even an idiot can see the numbers don't add up.

I despise willful stupidity. Pathetic spinning and whining instead of using basic logic... you're making yourself look ridiculous.

Interesting, since you just used WIKI as a source, but just a few months ago said this about WIKI:

<quote orig_author="California Girl">
Seriously, you're citing 'wiki' as the absolute authority? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

You do know that it's not a source for unbiased, strictly fact based information, right?

I love busting you with your own words. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>
