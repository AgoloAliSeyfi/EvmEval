I'm in a bit of a quandary on this one. Fundamentally, everyone is entitled to a private life and - no matter who they are - they have a right not to have their personal life dragged through the mud for political point scoring or for the general consumption of the public.

Having said that, I do feel that... if one is capable of treating one's own family so badly, or one breaks the vows of marriage... then why should I trust that person to take their oath of office seriously? If people cheat on their life partner, they are unlikely to treat anyone else any better.

And for me is that I could not care less if a man has a girlfriend on the side or 100 girlfriends (or even boyfriends) on the side. I never did care.

None of that, to me, translates into his ability to do the right things in office and it never has.

But for years all we ever heard about was Clinton's morals and now it seems that all of the sudden morals don't matter. There's a lot of inconsistency on this one and I have no problem pointing it out.

Obviously to the voters it didn't matter. Fully aware of Gennifer flowers millions voted for him anyway.

If you want to play this game, if it didn't matter than, it doesn't matter now.

You can't play the game of "I didn't think it mattered then, but now I do."

So when someone says, "It wasn't about the blowjob, it was about lying", it was about the blowjob. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_hand.gif"/>

So you think everyone just lies to you or that we are all just so confused we cant fathom what our reasons are for wanting Clinton impeached?

Actually, I think your instance on it being the blow job is the it was all about states rights rather than slavery deal. And hypocrisy in politics is not that big a deal either.

All the efforts and bribes etc etc were to avoid the loss of the civil rights case.

It wasn't just the issue of he got a blow job from a dim intern. It was that you got your job by going down. do we really want government officials appointed on the casting couch? And if you said no, then you were out of a job. Blow job or no job. And the man was a feminist icon. What kind of feminism is that that promotes that kind of employment 'opportunity.'

If you can swallow that it was 'just a blow job' than you swallow everything.

Now, fellatio aside, did Clinton's tomcatting gett in the way of his job? By all accounts, he was good at multitasking. Is this really all that relavent to his job performance?

Now if you could find proof that he was sleeping with someone from the Mafia or the KGB, that would be interesting sexual exchanges. Or that he was sleeping with lobbyist as payment for legislation, that would be interesting and worthwhile to discuss.

There is nothing weird about it. It's the good old double standard. Clinton wasn't just a philanderer, he was a world class sexual pervert enabled by his wife who is now the secretary of state.

The Cons can say what they want but yes, it was about the blowjob. And now they want to turn a blind eye to Newt's philandering and desire for an open marriage?

Pure hypocrisy.

Telling yourself that it was about the blow job allows you to howl hypocrisy.

Yeah, its a classic libtard dodge, isnt it?

Make up what you think your opponents *really* mean and then slam them for it.

Facing the truth of the matter, that he treated women like dirt and that if a woman had the courage to say no to him she had better shop the resume is beyond you.

</quote>

We critisize Clinton for being a philanderer who used his power to get sex and the libtards just assume that we really dont have a problem with that but it *must* be something else.

Wonder why that is?

<quote orig_author="Baruch Menachem">
But we still face the question of what is more important to us as citizens. Voting for incompetent and uxorious like Carter and Obama, or voting for comptent slime like Clinton and Gringrich.

The fact is that some of the best leaders throughout history have been philandering drunkards.

When you need a leader, you can be forgiven for over-looking a few things.

Rape isnt one of them.

So, i guess the population of divorced people shouldn't qualify for office. After all, they couldn't keep their vows for life.
