The Cobra law doesn't suck... before there was a Cobra law, when you lost your job, you lost your health insurance...

The higher Cobra premium reflects A) the loss of employer participation AND B) medical providers cut huge deals for employer based insurance claims and the soak the shit out of individual policies...

WHY are you so f_cking stupid???

Why are you?

You get laid off your job, in the next thirty days you get a letter from your employer telling you that you have the option to continue your health insurance coverage. Within the next 30 days or so, you have to pay last month's and next month's health insurance premiums and you must maintain your payments throughout your unemployment and most likely for the 90 days until your new employer picks up your coverage.

That is impossible for the vast majority of people.

What part of that don't you understand, idiot?

Oh, and by the way, with the COBRA laws, if you can't pay you still lose your coverage.

What part of that don't you understand, stupid?

Well pea brain, you are officially qualified as a DOLT...

WHAT PART of before COBRA there will be NO phone call, just a "You are canceled" notice in the mail...

BTW, If the phone call comes 30 days later, THEN last months premium is past due...

IF you lose you job and can't afford COBRA, you probably can't afford ANY health insurance, BUT you can apply for new insurance, but NOW any illness covered before you lost your job is NOW a preexisting condition...coverage DENIED for that affliction...

You are a drowning victim that is thrown a life jacket and whines that he wants a cabin cruiser...

IF you want FREE health care, move to CANADA!!!

Just IMAGINE (requires brains and empathy) where the elderly would be today without Medicare (government run health care), you know; those useless people that lose their job because they are too old to work leave the workforce...

BUT, help is here...THANKS to the evil Democrats!!!

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 as signed by Barack Obama includes a 65% subsidy to employees for COBRA-enabled insurance for up to 9 months after an involuntary termination. An employee is eligible for this subsidy if

* the termination of employment was involuntary,
* the terminated employee has no other group sponsored health insurance option, and
* the terminated employee is otherwise eligible to enroll in COBRA.

You are the one that wants free health care, not me and by the way the proposals going through Congress right now are not going to be free.

Yes, before COBRA, an employee was without, after COBRA the employee is still without. The COBRA law sucked. It didn't help and the ARRA doesn't help a whole hell of a lot either.

The problem is that normal laidoff person could not (pre-ARRA) and still cannot (post ARRA) afford health insurance during such a period. It doesn't help at all. ARRA is an effort to improve conditions, but it is not sufficient for most people who when laid off have to worry about where the mortgage is going to come from and can't even begin to worry about how they can pay health insurance premiums. Even with ARRA it is out of reach. That is why the COBRA laws suck.

So Freddie and Fannie are government agencies now?? LOL Man you repukes are sure stupid!! Bush gave them billions in bail out money to keep them out of bankruptcy.. They bankrupted themselves.. If you want to blame the government then blame rebuttlicans for removing all the regulations..

As for the rest of your post? The only problem our government has is conservatives.. Ever since Social security and medicare were created, you morons have tried to defund them or steal from their coffers to pay for your escapades... How much Social security money went to Iraq??

Grow a brain will you and get a real arguement!

Crime wave engulfed the House, the Senate, and the Executive Branch. Follow the money. Follow the Control and Oversight. How much did you profit from the scheme MajikMist?????

The lot of you should be barred from public employment, and be made to pay back every penny. Selling something for nothing. Cleaning up the mess by destroying what we were built on. Fuck off and die sound too harsh? Well, May you reap what you sow, and leave me out of it. Pay for your own clean up.

So people who are of lesser means should just be left to die? Sounds like you've got your OWN little death panel going on.

Funny that you would interpret it such. Public School Indoctrination????

I think that the Parasite Elites should stop building Their Wealth on the backs and necks of whats left of the true middle class and the poor, and maybe find productive work. Your management skills are too lacking, your compensation is off the charts.
