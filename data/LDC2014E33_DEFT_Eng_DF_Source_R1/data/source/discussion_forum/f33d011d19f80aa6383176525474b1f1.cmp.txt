Making excuses? Wouldn't that be you thinking the government is entitled to part of a person's estate? You've never explained why the government has a right to it other than they can make rules and enforce them at gunpoint. Why is the government entitled to it? You've never answered that. This is income that was taxed when it was earned that has been passed to a family member......no different than some other possession. Why is the government entitled to it other than it is easy pickings and they can send people to your house with guns to get it?

all income is taxed multiple times. every time it changes hands it is taxed again. your taxed on your income, then again on the sales, then again on property, then again and again. its the same as you winning the lottery, its free money to the person who receives it. an estate also doesnt necessarily have to be passed on to a family member. should your neighbor or friend get it tax free as well? whats the difference there?

Not by the same entity. Yes, I pay federal and state taxes on each pay check. When I go to the grocery store with the money I earned that the government actually allows me to keep, I pay a LOCAL sales tax. My property taxes are to the COUNTY. Now, if I were being taxed on my income by the feds and then paying a federal tax at the gorcery store, you might have an argument. The federal government already got a piece of the action each time I get paid. If I choose to give money to my son, they are not entitled to retax what they already taxed.

So I take it you do not live in a state or community that has an income or payroll tax?
Many communities have a payroll tax for the priveledge of working in their community whether you live in the community or not.

so the state taxes you on your income and then again with a sales tax when you spend it.

It is not that the tax exists, it is what is done with what is levied, it is about consent, it is about acting responsibly with a trust. What is Governments primary function again Citizen??? What are It's Powers? What are the Limits to those Powers? What is it's obligation in relation to transparency? Disclosure? Rule Of Law? Should the Government account for what it takes? for what it spends? For Hypocrisy?

And guess how many businesses choose to invest capital in buildings, infrastructure and such in those communities.
We run like a bat out of hell when a municipality initiates taxes like that.
Lower taxes means businesses are going there.
