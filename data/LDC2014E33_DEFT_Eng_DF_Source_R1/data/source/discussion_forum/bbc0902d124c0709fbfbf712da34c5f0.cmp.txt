Hello,

I am wondering if anyone could offer any advice. My grandad passed away very suddenly over the weekend and we expect his funeral to be late next week. My Grandad was very very important to me and I am dreading the funeral as I know it is really going to hit me hard then. I am told that there will only be family flowers as my Grandad wasn't a flowers kind of man so my Gran feels it would be inappropriate to have lots and lots of flowers there. I have been looking at the different flowers available and I am really unsure what sort of thing is appropriate from a granddaughter. I looked at the flowers that spell out Grandad but they are around Â£250 and as the only grandchild I cannot afford that on my own. I do not want to be tight in such circumstances but if I'm honest I think my Grandad would give me a right telling off if he thought I was going to spend that much money on flowers anyway. I don't want to get just a standard wreath as I feel that it should be something more special as he was such a special man to me and my children. Could anyone advise on what the done thing is from family? There seem to be wreaths, bouquets, posies, sprays and sheafs and I really don't understand which you are meant to send depending on your relation to the deceased.
Any help would be much appreciated.

Are there any flowers which in your mind connect the pair of you - for example if he used to call you buttercup then your grandmother would probably find a bunch of buttercups a nicer, personal thought that a huge wreath of lilies.

Did he ever buy you flowers? if so I'd try and get the same sort of flowers

Hi,

so sorry for your loss.

My dad always used a walking stick so when he died some of the grand children had flowers in that shape. Other grandchildren just had a small posy.

I think whatever you decide will be correct, it's the sentiment that counts not how much you spend on the flowers.

Unfortunatly, florists really rack up the prices for funerals. But I assume there is a good reason, perhaps delivery costs and tight timescales to services?
I've always been told lillies for funerals. My ex-mother-in-law used to give them to me for my birthday though, so either they're more versitile than I think, or she was sending me a message (50/50 on that one).
However, when a friend of mine died when we were young the florist told me to do white roses and babys breath. I thought they were very pretty and elegant.
A funeral is a celebration of someone's life, so don't feel locked into tradition. It's very spring time now, so if you want a massive bunch of wildflowers to remember him by and celebrate him go for it.
I'm sorry for your loss.
