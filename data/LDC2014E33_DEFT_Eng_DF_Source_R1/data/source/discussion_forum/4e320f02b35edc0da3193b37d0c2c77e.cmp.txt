I'm actually horrified at all the people here that have absolutely no idea about their own existence or the purpose of it, and sit bickering about all the meaningless political mud that is deliberately thrown in our eyes to blind us.

To control the people you must make them control each other, in exactly the way that is seen when people have these silly debates.
There is nothing to debate.
Everyone on the planet must have food and drink, and a place to live for life, without exception, no matter what they may or may not choose to contribute to the workings of society.
Then we can begin to talk about how we organize the other things.

Until that time, when the people demand this most vital set of rules, nothing is worth discussing.
Some people talk about their qualifications and level of 'education'.
Don't lie to yourselves, you have not been through the education system to benefit you, it does not measure intelligence. It creates what you see around you today:-
Division, confusion, hate, anger, egotistical morons that fully believe themselves to be of a higher intelligence because somebody gave them a bit of paper and a pat on the head and told them they are now qualified to go out into the world and repeat all the crap that they have been made to believe.
How tedious it is to see people still having these discussions.

We are more than we have been allowed to discover, we are capable of absolutely anything that can be imagined.
Yet they have us bickering like dumb animals and we actually give validity to politics and the system that has been designed solely to crush the spirit in us and make us controllable.
What part of 'divide and conquer', do people not understand.

Can you suggest a good place to purchase a tin foil hat?

Thanks

Well, the two comments that have been made in response to my post very much speak for themselves and do not require any further comment from me.
Although, I do appreciate the wisdom and thought that went into constructing them.

Ok, so where does the money come for this:
1) Huge investment cost upfront
2) Ongoing higher costs of goods
<img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/nono.gif"/>
Won't that affect the poor more than the rich?

Have you really thought this through....??

The "Hoover Dam" is a good example imo. I know when push comes to shove, health &amp; safety would prevent a carbon copy but you get the gist :

Supplying the likes of Asda with cheap labour, there's only one winner in that form of "Welfare to Work".

Actually you were asked if you could explain who the "they" are, which seems like a valid question to me.... I don't think you need to answer the tin foil hat one though.

Ok, a more constructive response:

What is the purpose of our existence in your opinion ?

So we don't live in a world where money is important and relevant?

So how do we achieve this - I think I'm right in saying that through advancement in technology, the number of people dying from disease and/or without clean water etc has fallen significantly.

So doesn't one necessarily follow the other?

Seems very short-sighted to me.

Again I ask, how best will this utopia be achieved?

Offensive ********, plain and simple.

Presumably you are qualified to judge this - how, why??
