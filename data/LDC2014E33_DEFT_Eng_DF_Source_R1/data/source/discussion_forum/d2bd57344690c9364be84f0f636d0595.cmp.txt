If you're gonna take credit for the good stuff, dont forget to take credit for the bad stuff that went on too, you hypocrite.

The resources wouldve been used for india's gain rather than the UK's.

What about it? You have a distorted view on islam, what can i say? Thats my opinion.

OH, I'll admit there was plenty of bad, but I'll not have us blamed for the bad that really doesn't lay at our door, like people starving. So yes, if you want to talk about various instances of brutality and overuse of force by British Officers, then I'll not deny it, but I'll not accept responsibility for not feeding everyone in a country when the concept of a welfare state was alien even in home territories.

And no, don't be so naive. If Britain wasn't there, or to be more accurate, if some colonial force wasn;t there, the resources wouldn't be. There would be noone producing and refining them, no market for export etc.

No, I have an objective view, yours' is distorted <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

Exactly, I mean despite living in the west we have managed to preserve not only our culture but also our values and morals. It just seems so unjust and extremely hypocritical, I mean Zardari on one hand, is literally making Pakistan an awful place for most to live in, yet he himself and the higher class are occupied indulging in a completely western lifestyle.

I mean in my eyes, all politicians are power hungry. I mean my parents are pretty supportive of Imran Khan, he sure does seem a lot better than the rest of them, but at the end of the day how much can one man achieve when the rest of the government is corrupt.

Oh and heres the link to part one...Tell me what you think!

Sorry my point wasn't clear, but I always though that Pakistan was founded to be a Muslim state, is that not correct? :s But yes definitely, I think Jinnah led a lifestyle more lavish than most higher class Pakistanis today. It's just the side of Pakistan I've always seen is literally a world away from what I saw, I think I've always known that the higher class are extremely different to most other Pakistanis but actually seeing it is a whole other feeling.

My mum was born and brought up here like me, and my dad came here at a young age, so both are very different to most of my Pakistani friends' parents. I think their outlook is slightly different, yet I think somehow the Pakistani values have been instilled in me. And of course, no culture is superior to the next, but when Pakistan was created with a certain vision its sad to see it all wither away not too long after, if that makes sense?

I guess the more I think about it, it's true. There has always been a group that has been a lot more in tune with western society than the rest, but doesn't that group seem to be continuously expanding? Anyways there was a quote that I read recently by Angelina Jolie about Pakistan, I can't seem to find it at the moment, I'll post it to you later.

Definitely! I mean I think to a certain extent it's perfectly fine, every country in a way is influenced by western media, but it's just sad to see the country and people lose their values.

yeah unfortunate isnt it. i think the country is deteriorating fast. so much corruption aswell. its no wonder they're not doing well economically.

Because salt alone stops starvation and is the basis of a flourishing economy... <img src="images/smilies/colonhash.gif"/>

You've gotten more trollish of late. It's quite sad. Continue such wild accusations, and we'll see how you enjoy warning points, as you are in the habit of reporting anyone who is less than polite to you.

India was a new nation, salt would not have sustained it but it wouldve gone a long way. Salt wasnt the only natural resource.
