What did I say about watching the idiot box.You are practically in a panic.Turn the damned thing off.Of course I am aware of the problem with islam.But I'm not worried about it.How are they going to get over here? Are they comming with their navy or their air force?Look, I'm telling you these things because we as a group have strayed away from the gospel.I'm telling you these things because they are written.In the Bible.I didn't write them,God wrote them.You do not want to be among those that lead others into captivity.You do not want to betray your fellow Christians,not even for the sake of your own safety.Safety that is frankly,just an illusion.If God wills that the US will stand then it will.If God wills that the US will fall,then it will.But everything we do is a matter of record.There is not one idle word that will not be brought up in the judgement.We are NOT in control of what happenes to us.God is in control.And God has given us instruction about how to live this life.It's clearly written.Love God with all your heart and all your strength and all your mind.What does that mean?That means,follow the ten commandments.All of them. Not just the ones that are convienient.Of course Jesus is the only one that has ever actually done this.However, that's not an excuse to abandon them entirely.The second commandment is,Love thy neighbor as thyself.Obviously,this means, do nothing to your neighbor that you would not have him do to you.Jesus gave us these commandments,so that we might know what to do in order to enter heaven.The entire New Testament is just a reptition of these commandments.When we hate our neighbor,we break these commandments.When we hate our neighbor,we kill him.When we kill our neighbor we leave physical proof that we hate him.It is therefore impossible to say that we loved him.Look, God knows to the second when we will die,and what circumstances we will die in.To him it's already a done deal.We can't change this.All we can do is trust his word.Is God a liar? Absolutely not! So I trust him when he says that if I do the commandments of Jesus,I will be saved.I also trust him when he says that if I don't,I will not enter heaven.Let's have a little faith.Let's follow Jesus.Everyone else just leads us astray.

DUH,they are already here! You NEED to turn on the tv and at least listen to the news! Have you not heard even Arabs call Detroit the new Lebanon?
However I do believe you only pretend to be so unknowlegeable. You go right ahead and be kissy-huggy with them while they convert you at sword's point,as for me I will continue to do all I can to warn Americans to BEWARE OF COMPLACENCY where Islam intruding onto American's rights is concerned!

The mixture of church and state that is in it's formative stage now,needs this war to misdirect our attention.
