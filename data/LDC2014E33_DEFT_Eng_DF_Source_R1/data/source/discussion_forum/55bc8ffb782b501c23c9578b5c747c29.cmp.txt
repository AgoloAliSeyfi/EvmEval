you pay for other peoples health care every time you pay your insurance premiums.... are you protesting your current insurance company as right now?

What does that have to do with the point that the government should not be forcing people to pay for other people's contraception or force insurance companies to provide coverage for contraception?

</quote>

the government didnt say you directly pay for other peoples health care idiot. the law says the health care providers can not change an extra co-pay or co-insurance for contraception. its not free, its simply included in the cost of your premium.

seeing as how you already pay for other peoples services, why are you not complaining about every other service your health care provider provides for no additional cost?

When you go to a grocery store do you pay for other people's food? When you go to Best Buy do you pay for other people's computers?

Again,

I don't have to have insurance, its still a choice.

How an insurance company uses the money from the premiums to pay for other people's health care is their business. If they want to charge extra for contraception coverage that is also also their business not the government's you arrogant prick.

you have no idea what this conversation is even about.

point to where the government says you will pay for other peoples contraception? the argument stems from a portion of the law that states all insurance plans must provide contraception as a services. and that service will be provided for no extra charge. meaning no extra copay or coinsurance.

do you have any idea how insurance actually works already? get an education dumbass.

Do you have any idea that I am making a philosophical point? Apparently not.

Did you fail to understand my other philosophical point that the government should not be forcing insurance companies to provide services? Apparently so.

How insurance works? Education? Really?

Get over your superiority complex dickhead

if you dont understand a simple premise like how insurance works obviously cant understand the rest of the argument.

so what you are really advocating is that insurance companies and health care providers not be regulated to have uniform standards? hmmm like all those ethical insurance companies who used to drop people when they got sick, or refused to provide them certain services they thought were too expensive, or refused to provide coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. hmmm sounds like a wonderfully perfect system. pretty soon they wont have any regulations, and then they wont have to provide services to anyone who cant pay full price for the services. so no one will have access to coverage.

Wait a minute.

Aren't you the guy that insists that premiums go directly to pay for other people's services? How can you argue that and, at the same time, argue that people aren't actually paying for other people's services?
