well that's what I think, but it seems anytime someone is cocky, you hear that "He really is masking his poor self image" thing.

That's sometimes the case. But Ali has and always will be confident in his own abilities. Let's face it, many people thought he would of died two or three years ago. But he's still fighting Parkinson's.

He truly did deserve Sportsman of the Century.

Tomorrow is the State of the Union and Obama will be talking about the huge deficit we have. Why didn't we ever hear about it during the Bush admin when during his admin the national debt was more than doubled? The deficits were huge!

But Bush hid them. He didn't put the two wars in the budget like Obama is doing. Remember all those emergency supplementals that congress voted on every few months? 250 billion here, 500 billion there, to fund the wars. We don't have those anymore, because the wars are funded, out in the open, by the budget.

But now, we see the deficit spending that these wars are causing, and suddenly everyone's all outraged.

This money has been draining our treasury for 8 years already.

The 2009 debt number is from the Bush administration's fiscal year. When they post the 2010 numbers, that will be Obama's.

So I was just wondering why the media is so stupid? They keep talking about the huge deficit in the Obama admin. But they never mentioned the doubling of the national debt under the Bush admin. Are they really so stupid that they didn't realize all those war supplementals weren't in the budget and therefore hidden away each year?

You are right. The media is stupid.

Reagan and the two Bushes created 92% of the National Debt by lowering taxes on the rich and increasing wasteful military spending.

Yup... they spiked after Katrina... then we had the bubble... it popped... and gas has pretty much settled where it was shortly after Katrina.

The thing I remember the most about Katrina was gas prices SOARING over $3.00 overnight because of it and then they never really came back down.

Weird, huh?
