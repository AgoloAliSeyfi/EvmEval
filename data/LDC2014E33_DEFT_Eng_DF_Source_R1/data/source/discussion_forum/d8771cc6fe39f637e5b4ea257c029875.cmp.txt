This is one of many:

The Quran on Seas and Rivers:
Modern Science has discovered that in the places where two different seas meet, there is a barrier between them. This barrier divides the two seas so that each sea has its own temperature, salinity, and density.1 For example, Mediterranean sea water is warm, saline, and less dense, compared to Atlantic ocean water. When Mediterranean sea water enters the Atlantic over the Gibraltar sill, it moves several hundred kilometers into the Atlantic at a depth of about 1000 meters with its own warm, saline, and less dense characteristics. The Mediterranean water stabilizes at this depth2 (see figure 13).

Figure 13: The Mediterranean sea water as it enters the Atlantic over the Gibraltar sill with its own warm, saline, and less dense characteristics, because of the barrier that distinguishes between them. Temperatures are in degrees Celsius (C°). (Marine Geology, Kuenen, p. 43, with a slight enhancement.) (Click on the image to enlarge it.)

Although there are large waves, strong currents, and tides in these seas, they do not mix or transgress this barrier.

The Holy Quran mentioned that there is a barrier between two seas that meet and that they do not transgress. God has said:

He has set free the two seas meeting together. There is a barrier between them. They do not transgress. (Quran, 55:19-20)

But when the Quran speaks about the divider between fresh and salt water, it mentions the existence of “a forbidding partition” with the barrier. God has said in the Quran:

He is the one who has set free the two kinds of water, one sweet and palatable, and the other salty and bitter. And He has made between them a barrier and a forbidding partition. (Quran, 25:53)

One may ask, why did the Quran mention the partition when speaking about the divider between fresh and salt water, but did not mention it when speaking about the divider between the two seas?

Modern science has discovered that in estuaries, where fresh (sweet) and salt water meet, the situation is somewhat different from what is found in places where two seas meet. It has been discovered that what distinguishes fresh water from salt water in estuaries is a “pycnocline zone with a marked density discontinuity separating the two layers.”3 This partition (zone of separation) has a different salinity from the fresh water and from the salt water4 (see figure 14).

<img src="http://www.islam-guide.com/ch1-1-e-img2-big.htm"/>

Figure 14: Longitudinal section showing salinity (parts per thousand ‰) in an estuary. We can see here the partition (zone of separation) between the fresh and the salt water. (Introductory Oceanography, Thurman, p. 301, with a slight enhancement.) (Click on the image to enlarge it.)

This information has been discovered only recently, using advanced equipment to measure temperature, salinity, density, oxygen dissolubility, etc. The human eye cannot see the difference between the two seas that meet, rather the two seas appear to us as one homogeneous sea. Likewise, the human eye cannot see the division of water in estuaries into the three kinds: fresh water, salt water, and the partition (zone of separation).

I pray and I immerse myself in spiritual activities till Taraweeh..After that it's mostly either going to mall to buy stuff (i live in doha) or hanging out with friends.
This year is going to be unique though as i have to fly out to university on May 20 (Toronto) so let's see.

With Ramadan approaching I was wondering do you change your lifestyle for the month. Do you stop doing certain things that you would normally do, do you stop going out. Also how much do your sleeping habits change and what do you do during the day. Finally what do you eat after you break your fast.. I love my kebabs.. <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

As im still at Uni and on holiday I generally change my sleeping habits so im awake during the night and sleep more during the day. As for how i pass my time, I often go clubbing in the night(Ive never drunk and won't even try to get it on with girls during Ramadan)), eat out late with friends and just generally chill around london late at night, oh and the odd late night call of duty sessions with mates. I also go to the mosque every night with my family which is acutally good, as i meet my muslim friends and we make plans for the next few nights. I'm glad ramadan has been during the holidays for my uni years, its actually quite an enjoyable time for me. So what about you lot?

</quote>

I'm mostly the same as i'm any other time, just as its getting quite hot i tend to stay home more often. My sleeping habits become a bit weird, get home ater Taraweeh and go sleep, wake up, eat sehri and then start the day

I'm confused though, if you have no sexual activity during ramadan, does that mean that you normally do? sorry if that's personal.

Wel ldone to you aswell btw. It feels so great at the end when you manage to go the whole time without slipping up dosen't it. <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>
