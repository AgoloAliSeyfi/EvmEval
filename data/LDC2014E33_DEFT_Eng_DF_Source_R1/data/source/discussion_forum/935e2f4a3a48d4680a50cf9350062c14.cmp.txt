What's a Senator make?
What's an E-4 with a wife and two kids make - the active duty one in a combat zone.
You should be ashamed of yourself, you unpatriotic fuck

You are misunderstanding my point. And if you are anti union or a Republican then I am accusing you of being the unpatriotic fuck. I think unions are just as important to middle class America as our soldiers are. Let me explain. America wouldn't be the great place it is today if it weren't for unions. And as we see union membership decline, so does the middle class. Do you like 40 hour work weeks and overtime? Thank a union. How about vacation days and sick days? How about fair and safe labor laws that protect you in the workplace? Unions faught and died for all these things.

And just like there are bad soldiers there are bad union members. Doesn't mean you condemn the whole group.

Are you in the GOP? Thenk you are in favor of breaking unions. Having them pay more for their healthcare? Take away their collective bargaining rights. Take pay cuts so the company/country can be more profitable? Why should they sacrafice and not you? Police should take cuts but not you?

I agree. The Senator makes too much and they didn't go after his pay. They want after teachers, police and firefighters. Same for the Bush tax breaks. Rather than let them expire like they should, they asked teachers and firefighters to pay more. If you are ok with that, then you are the unpatriotic fuck. I don't care if you served or not. You know the few bad apples I mentioned earlier? I would just consider you a bad apple.

And I don't advocate for cutting your benefits. Not unless you are a righty. Then I would say you deserve the cuts because you vote for the wrong party. In other words, serves you right.

The GOP would say you don't deserve anything more than you were promised when you signed up. And even then, you may have to sacrafice just like you are asking others to do when they renig on their pensions ala Bain Capital. No one forced you to sign up. You were paid a wage. Given a break on college, correct?

You know what; in nine years in the army, I did see a few bad soldiers; I have seen a lot more union thugs, though. And as comparing pay and service between first responders and the military, I've done both, and the military pays a lot less, for a lot more risk. That's right a lot more risk- I've run into a burning building, and I've also run into enemy fire-would you care to know which I'd prefer to face? By the way, in my experience, the LEAST professional first responders I've ever seen all worked in unionized departments-I wonder why that is?

Of course, as the words I bolded indicate, this is totally political with you. I can smell a union democrat a mile away, and I already figured you for one-this just confirms it.

I'm not a lifer, but I've known and served with a lot of them, and pal, most of them aren't working 40 hour weeks either; the military doesn't have as many butt jobs as it once did. You just dislike them, because the majority of them do NOT share your political views. Of course, you wouldn't know anything first-hand about any of that, because my guess is, you never served. Now end it, little child, because the MEN here are trying to have a conversation.

USMC Grunts and the rest of their combat arms units are working 24/7 in Iraq and Afghanistan. Just like they have done through out our history. Those not presently in combat are constantly training to remain combat ready. The lifers from WWII and Korea were high ranking NCOs and Officers in Vietnam and they taught and led us well.
God Bless Them!

Those VA Benefits doesn't include car payments or mortage [ sic] payments shit stain.

</quote>

Using the conservative logic of the day -- as with Planned Parenthood, government payments subsidize other actions. Recipients are able to afford mortgage payments and car payments because the welfare subsidies ( VA benefits), handouts, free up other monies

</quote>

This is exactly what I'm talking about when I speak of the growing disconnect between the Military and the Civilian sector, you obviously never served a damn day in your life. VA Benefits are a case by case basis and that amount is different for everyone depending on their disabilities, and they are not hand outs you stupid fuck.

</quote>

yeah right. every bum I know has told me they had their discharge upgraded and they get VA benefits.

every time I've volunteered at some homeless shelter or food place some VA guy shows up and tries to sign up everyone.

I've been told how to screw the VA, get benefits and live off the system

wake the fuck up turd boy. I know people who ran the VA and have to keep my mouth shut around them, because like you they are all blind
