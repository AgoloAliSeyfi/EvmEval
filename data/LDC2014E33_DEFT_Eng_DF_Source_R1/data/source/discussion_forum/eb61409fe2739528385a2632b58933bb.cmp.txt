I can't blame a corporation for not hiring.

Of course progressives believe its a companies job to hire because money grows on trees...

If I was a CEO i'd piss out my office window... hahahaha

Well Steve Wynn--a DEMOCRAT home boy--and CEO says screw Obama they arent' going to hire until Obama is GONE.

"I'm saying it bluntly, that this administration is the greatest wet blanket to business, progress and job creation in my lifetime. A lot of people don't want to say that. They'll say, 'Oh God, don't be attacking Obama.' Well, this is Obama's deal, and it's Obama that's responsible for this fear in America."

"The guy [Obama] keeps making speeches about redistribution, and maybe 'we ought to do something to businesses that don't invest or hold too much money.' We haven't heard that kind of talk except from pure socialists."

"Business is being hammered. The business community in this country is frightened to death of the weird political philosophy of the president of the United States. Until he's gone, everybody's going to be sitting on their thumbs."

If I was in charge of hiring I would do whats in my companies best interests... Hiring redundant workers wouldn't be one of my priorities..

I'm sure democrats expect companies to hire for no reason...

If they don't they're rich snobs...

Democrats see companies the same way they see government: An entity that exists solely to support a person without holding that person any way accountable or expecting anything in return.

It's Microsoft's moral responsibility to hire, pay and care for hordes of left wingers. Pay them just to...well, show up and blog and drink coffee.

This is what I've been trying to say all day. Despite how much the dems have warned that cutting govt would derail the recovery - govt continues to shed jobs and yet the private sector continues to pick up. This is a slap in the fact for big govt dems who cry out at even the littlest cut to govt.

So we've heard 2 years worth of Obama whining like his OWS peasants, Him mostly whining about a "do nothing Congress" and the "GOP obstruction" stopping him from doing anything.

Now unemployment is down to 8.6%. And libtards are dropping to their knees to PRAISE HIM!!!!

Why? CEO's approved this hiring. Corporations funded it. Barack Hussein Obama has been hampered by a "do nothing Congress" and "GOP obstructionists"......right?

So when shit goes bad, Obama is immune from blame, because a do-nothing Congress and the GOP are preventing Him from dong anything.

But when things go well, He gets immediate credit, despite the fact that all that new hiring is being done by the very CEO's and corporations He and his ilk spew verbal venom at every chance they get.

Thanks to all the CEO's and corporations for taking the chance to go ahead and hire. We know, with Obama in office the future is very unknown and shaky, but you guys hired anyway. Keep up the good work. And Mr. President...try not to fuck it up. Of course, you cant't do much with a do-nothing Congress, so not sure why you got credit for it anyway.

Wow

A right-winger admitting unemployment is actually down. I guess Obama only gets credit when unemployment goes up

I think it is a safe and secure answer to the question; "Why are you a liberal?" Because I don't want to be associated with Bucs90.
