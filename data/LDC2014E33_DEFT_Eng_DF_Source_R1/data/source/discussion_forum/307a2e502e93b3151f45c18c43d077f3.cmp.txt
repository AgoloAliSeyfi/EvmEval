And yet another reason to get government out of marriage except for governmental matters of taxes, inheritance, and power of attorney for emergencies and medical decisions....

Again.. all a ploy for forced acceptance and government interference on one side.. and on the other side, not wanting to reduce government's scope

power of attorney can be handled locally. Inheritance is a right. Goverment should have diddly to do with it. Taxes should be simplified so that marriage or family relationships are null and void, a non sequitor item.

government should have nothing to do with inheritance rights? really?

damn... and to think every state has trusts and estates laws governing how estates are handled. these issues have always been dealt with by government. rights of dower, courtesy, inheritance,

you claim not to want government interference, yet you're ok with government interfering in the relationship between two people. and it's ok for government to tell me i can't purchase birth control?

i think you might want to work on consistency.

I am not OK with government interfering in marriage. I thought I made that abundantly clear. Marriage is between the individual and God. Government cannot and should not attempt to legislate it. As they should stay out of inheritance and all things marriage related. I trust that my family members would beat the hell out of anyone who tried to take away any property of mine that belonged ot my wife when I leave. If we both left at the same time then survival of the fittest suits me fine. As long as who is left doesn't defile common law rules against violence (the proper place for government) then all is well.

If you want to file a joint return, have your IRA passed on to your spouse without the tax burden, have legal recognition as family, and lots of other stuff you need a document accepted by the government as proof of marriage.

Those are all government rules. I state. Abolish them all.

</quote>

In other words. I am a family because I state I am a family. The government should have zero interference in that. Their tax laws, interference in my retirement plans or lack thereof should be abolished. It is none of their business and the only reason they have ever ascerted themselves into it was to find out what they could take.
