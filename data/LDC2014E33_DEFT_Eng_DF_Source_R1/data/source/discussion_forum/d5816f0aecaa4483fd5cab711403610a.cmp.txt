Not mad at all. You're just wrong. No one wants to make us "all the same". That's just your typical brainwashed bullshit that I hear all the time from the right. You ask ANY progressive on here that same question and I doubt you'd even get a positive response from ONE of them.

No one said the rich can't be so. That's just Rush Beckbaugh talking to your ignorant ass.

And that's always the lefts excuse for denying what they really are. Believe it or night most people on the right don't get weekly marching orders from Beck or Limbaugh. Do you see me accusing you of being a Michael Moore or Paul Krugman parrott?

The left wants equal outcomes. How do I know that? Look at the policies they push for. Giving more and more for the poor and taking more and more from the rich. Are you really trying to deny that? How can such policies result in anything but an equally mediocre society? Freedom and safety are opposites where government is concerned. The more you you gain of one the more you lose of the other and the simple fact is liberals value security more than freedom. We can all strive for risk free lives, but keep in mind that is going to curtail the ability of anyone person to succeed much beyond another and believe it or not there are benefits to members of society defining and achieving measures of success as defined by themselves rather than government.

No... we just want a fair day's pay for a fair day's work... adjusted for inflation and cost of living. Simple as that. Unfortunately... the only people that get to decide what that fair day's pay is... is the people who don't want to give a fair day's pay. You even want MORE of the same... you applaud every time everyday workers lose their right to organize. You applaud every time the jobs go overseas.... because it's "their right" to do that. You applaud the gross tax evasion that those same entities are allowed to commit because "they are just trying to keep what is theirs". All hail the Plutocracy! Fuck the country, fuck the shrinking Middle Class, fuck the elderly, fuck the kids and most of all... fuck the poor. The ONLY people you feel are worthy of anything are the rich. Everyone else can go scratch their asses.

I don't give a flying fuck how much other people have... but when a vast number of the people in this country can barely afford to keep a roof over their heads, their families fed and pay their monthly utilities, then you see reports on how the rich keep hauling money in at a record pace... well, if you can't see the fucked up nature of that... then you are too indoctrinated to even debate with.

Finally... the left's excuse for "denying what they are"? What... are you going to throw the "M" word out? I am not a fuckin' Marxist... that's more of your brainwashed propaganda against the vast majority of our population... you know... the people who do the wealthy's dirty work and get shit on at every turn?

Really? Care to back up your "vast number"? From where I sit, the vast number of people aren't holed up in some shanty eating shoe leather. I'm in a city with over a million people in the greater metro area. The Occupy folks are camped out a block from my downtown office. The most I've ever seen at one time is about a dozen people. You'd think that if the "vast number" are as poor off as you would have us believe, they'd be swelling the ranks of the folks championing them, but they aren't. Why? They are at work putting a roof over their family's head and living life.

Look, you want to talk about fucked up, propaganda and indoctrination, you need to can that class warfare bullshit like, "the people who do the wealthy's dirty work and get shit on at every turn" if YOU want to be taken seriously.

He doesn't get it, he won't ever get it. Apparently it's too tough of a concept.

</quote>

You're the one who doesn't get it. The fact that you use some criteria to identify people to tax other than identifying them by name doesn't mean you aren't discriminating against them by name.

I already posted you an example that proves my point.

</quote>

Not some criteria....Income.

Nothing more, nothing less.

</quote>

Does it really matter whether you name them by individual name or simply by demographic?

There just are not enough left handed guys named 'Doug' to cause much of a ruckus. Tax them at 100%.
