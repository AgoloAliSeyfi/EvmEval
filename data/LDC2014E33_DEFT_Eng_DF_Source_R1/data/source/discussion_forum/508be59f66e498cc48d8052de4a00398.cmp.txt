and yet you voted for a new "debt doubler".

You should have lent me your crystal ball. I don't have one. And yet even if I knew, I'd have approved. We aren't in a great depression now BECAUSE of what Obama's done with his policies.

</quote>

So what your saying is that you are only upset when Bush spends money. Cause you approve when Obama spends more.

</quote>

Sheesh dude, I can't help you with this reading comprehension problem, but I am getting annoyed by your lies about what I'm saying.

How about this, you tell us what you say, and I'll tell us what I say.

That way you can post honestly and quit lying about what I say.

Why didn't we hear about the deficit during the Bush administration?

</quote>

When not waving the flag, Rush and Hannity bemoaned it quite often. Beck mocked and chided Shrub and the congress constantly. Guys like Boortz and Jason Lewis were going absolutely nuts. Then, there were the dems and their compliant media toadies, who pissed and moaned about it in conjunction with the tax cuts for those eeeeeevil "wealthy" people.

Whoever didn't hear about deficits exploding during Chimpy McShrub's eight years had to have been living on a deserted island, with Gilligan and the gang.

</quote>

All while thumping their chests about the Bush economy....

You did hear some conservatives bitch about Bush's spending... they were mostly Libertarians or people too embarrassed to admit they were republicans at the time. Everyone else found religion on January 20, 2009.

</quote>

I don't know much about Beck. I have only seen him a couple times. but is he a libertarian? can't imagine fox would hire him, considering they didn't invite Ron Paul to their debate.

Pretty much...I quit listening to him because he's such a damned negative Nancy.

In any case, he was busting pretty hard on the administration and the (R) congress for spending like crazy.

Never listened to Boortz and Lewis... Beck did what his masters told him to do.

I know you were going nuts over there... but there was a buttload of ppl there with guns loaded ready to shout down anyone criticizing the Bush economy and his spending.
