Your daughter should start looking now. Tell her to get a good resume together and start submitting them online. Having a job is easier then not having one when looking. Employers like hiring people away from other firms. First..it's almost a seamless transition and second, if it's a rival then all the better.

And the "profits" they are making are accounting tricks. It doesn't last forever. And really, it's them that started the loss of demand. For two reasons. They wanted to cut high labor costs by hiring overseas and creating a glut of people looking for work. Initially layoffs had nothing to do with loss of demand. It was "synergy". Eventually..that's what started to happen, because UE got so high. But now..even the Chinese factories are in trouble because people are not buying their cheap crap.

Thus, people are starting to look for government solutions to the problem. And quite frankly, alot of things need to be done. Infrastructure, implementing new tech like cloud and IPv6, and high speed rail. However..that could tighten the high tech/engineer market again. Which would be bad for alot of these companies. Which is one reason I think a hiring boom will happen. What better time to snap up well trained peeps who've been out of work for awhile. And they get them on the cheap, while looking like "heroes".

In other words - Sallow is hoping for another mass bailout and enormous government spending. But no worries...Obama wants to cut 3 $trillion out of the deficit in 10 years (which will of course increase the deficit not decrease it)

Actually..some states are doing what the Fed won't..and adding Stimulus. New York State just wrapped up a huge deal with Cornell..

And Cuomo kiboshed the idea of killing the millionaire's tax in favor of putting together a package of infrastructure projects. And walking around the city you can see construction is booming.

I assume you have noticed that colleges have been in a massive growth boom for the past 7-8 years. School construction has never been better.
And who could be surprised?
We are just now beyond the height of the education bubble created by the government. And it will burst. And it will be ugly when it does.
I would think you would not be in favor of this. I would assume you don't like how tuition has ballooned in the past decade?

I don't think you'll see a "Hiring boom" till after the 2012 elections and that would depend greatly on the outcome.

</quote>

What exactly are you basing this on?

On another blog several years ago I said corporations wouldn't be hiring for a while for a number of reasons.

-They wanted to cut benefits and wages.
-They wanted to make the President look bad to loosen regulations or get another guy in office.

That position got slammed..but it turned out to be pretty true.

</quote>

They aren't hiring. But not for the reasons you state. You imaginarium is running along the paranoid lines. I've seen many small business owners interviewed and have listened to many who are members here on this board..

A. Thousands of anti business regulations from obama

B. obama care and the associated costs.

c. Uncertainty in an anti business enviornment.

D. They're not look forward to the expiration of the Bush tax cuts.

so,, we'll wait and see who is right.

</quote>

A. Which ones?
B. Cost of Healthcare was rocketing up prior to ObamaCare. Employers were asking for more of a contribution from Employees.
C. What "Anti-Business" environment? Did interest rates suddenly spike? Several rounds of QE were "anti-business"?
D. Read my OP.

and why would an employer hire new employees that he may have to lay off later and then know he's going to have to pay unemployment benefits for a lifetime? who in the hell would knowingly do that?

Please. Stop. Talking.
