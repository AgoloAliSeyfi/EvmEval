I am not assuming, the statistic's say that there is a very large number of marriages end in divorce whether it be straight or Gay's.
I also said that you should have the same rights but doing it with laws.
I also said why it harms the nation as a whole.

Couples living together. Sex without marriage.
Drug abuse, porn, sex trafficking, alcoholism and homosexuality,pedophiles and bestiality.
Whenever these type of sins become accepted by society, civilization starts to decay and fall.
All of this leads to the decline of the family unit. A husband and wife who raise their families. When things go well with the family, life is worth living, when the family falters, life falls apart.

When deadly sins like pedophiles, bestiality and homosexuality are accepted it decays the moral and spiritual values in a well ordered civilization.

Families are the foundation of a nation.

When one sin becomes more acceptable others follow.
If you get your marriage rights, what is stopping the next one, which is those that want to marry their animal sex partners. They are coming out of the closet around the world now and are speaking out about their civil rights also.

Do you think couples who are not virgins should be allowed to marry?

Isn't that a deadly sin?

No it is not a deadly sin. But homosexuality is even worse, God says it's an abomination, worse that a deadly sin.
If more people would stop having sex any old time they wished, with as many people as they wanted to, the sexual diseases in this nation would decline dramatically though.

Why do you think that commandment is there?
Lucy goosey sex causes diseases and eventually death. It does not matter what your sexual preference's are.

Leviticus 18:22 reads, "Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination."
Leviticus 20:13. It reads, "If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them."

The verses above from Leviticus are in a section of the Bible that lists immoral acts and the penalties for them. Homosexual activities are listed right alongside other immoral acts such as having sex with animals, incestuous relationships, adultery, etc. God does not say that this behavior is something that you should have "gay pride" about. God calls it a sexual sin and says that because of such practices, the nations in the land were being cast out. Leviticus 18:24, 30 reads, "Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you. Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the Lord your God."

And if we continue to be a nation that allows sex with anyone, any time with anyone. He will turn his back on us and we will no longer have his blessings.
The Majority of this nation believes in God and believes that he will turn on us. This is why homosexuality is a great harm to our society.
