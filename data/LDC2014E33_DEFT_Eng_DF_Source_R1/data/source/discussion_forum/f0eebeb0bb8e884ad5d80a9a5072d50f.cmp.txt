The point of healthcare is that it's universal. As far as possible, doctors avoid judging and imposing decisions on patients because that's not their job- their job is to treat. The role of the NHS in determining who is "deserving" stems from, and only from, the principle of justice (i.e. deciding how to fairly split funding and medical practitioners' time so on). So it's not that the obese are getting an advantage over cancer sufferers in some discriminatory way, it's got more to do with cost. That's an important distinction in emotive language.
Also, according to Embarrassing Fat Bodies, there were 7,000 gastric bypasses last year. Given the stats for obesity (1/4 of British adults are obese), that's hardly excessive.

How would you propose that we stop treating obese people? If someone collapses, do paramedics look at them, think "oh, they have quite a belly, can't be helping them" and leave them to die? If an obese person has a prolapse (which can be caused by obesity, but can also be caused by childbirth) do they get treated for that (you can't pinpoint obesity as the cause) or not?
And if the implication is that someone shouldn't be treated for something self-inflicted, does that mean there shouldn't be STD treatment for those who had unprotected sex? What about treatment for vegetarian anemics? The list is endless.

Genetics can put you at risk of obesity (leptin (hormone which regulates appetite) deficiency, overactive thyroid, certain alleles of the FTO gene can highly increase risk of obesity). Even environmental causes like bullying can lead to obesity, and frankly, refusing to treat someone from something which is the product of their genetic make up and environment seems to me unfair.

There's a massive problem with obesity, and the NHS's prevention schemes haven't worked. It's a problem that needs to be tackled, but refusing treatment to people will make nay difference- the number of shows on TV about the risks of obesity is actually unreal, and yet our nation carries out getting fatter- not many people look far enough in the future to realise damage they're doing to their bodies.

Yes it would be fiendishly difficult neigh on impossible to implement. I have no diea how the situation would be carried about. Really I'm just highlighting an injustice. My mum works at a private hospital as a physio were the NHS outsource bariatric patients from Liverpool Hospital and they have seen an increase in Gastric patients each year she has worked there for the past 3 years, so it's becoming an increasing issue. Rejection of treatment is obviously the wrong way to go about it, but would you not agree the system in it's current state does nothing to dis-inventivise unhealthy living. According to my mother the NHS guidelines, albeit for the physio aftercare, is just a short talk about healthy living.

I am fat and have never needed serious medical treatment, go to doctors about once a year(for depression) and I dont smoke or drink so am otherwise healthy.

Then you are not the problem, it is a reasonably small minority at the absolute extreme of the spectrum that are the issue.

I don't disagree that it's a problem, I just think that the suggestion that they shouldn't get treatment is plain outlandish (even if you didn't suggest that, other people have).

Mm, it's not like there aren't schemes for healthy eating and dietitians on the NHS though. To tackle obesity attitudes need to change but how to get that to happen, I don't know. Hopefully the work that's going on in schools now will have a positive impact on the future

AND....not only does it make financial sense but practical sense. I had a patient a few weeks ago who was around 35-40stone and she was so big we had to specially order in a bariatric hoist and sling from a hospital over in birmingham as they were too big to move or do anything with.

We couldn't even was her, toilet her, dress her without effort- and ended up becoming an 8 person job and doing a lot of 'unoffical' damage to our own backs.

Now i'd much rather be caring for less people like this DUE to the fact they were recieving gastric bands, than the NHS forking out on speciality equipment....

It's awful isn't it? I dread caring for really huge patients as it's just impossible to do.
