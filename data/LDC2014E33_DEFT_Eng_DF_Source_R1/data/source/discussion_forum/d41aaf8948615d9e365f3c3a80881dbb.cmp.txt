It is always interesting to me the vitriol of the ignorant.
People who will jump on the bandwagon of hate because an individual they disagree with is receiving prominence...or in many cases only think they disagree with them because they were told they should.

Glenn Beck is an easy target for ridicule.
The way he chooses to bring a message out is all too often a little too flamboyant, a little carried away. And in the process, unfortunately, his message is lost because of this.

I applaud Glenn Beck, and this rally.
Any rally that brings out the little dark secret that this nation has lost all sense of value and honor is OK by me.
Because we have.

As I've said several times, if it were anybody but Glenn Beck leading the charge, I'd agree wholeheartedly. But he has a clear agenda. End of story.

What specific part of the rally do you not agree with? Stop the ad hominem for one damn minute and post something legitimate...please.

You know how I know this event will succeed? Every left wing psycho on this board is attacking Beck, and not his message. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

So far, his "messages" have been replete with innuendoes at best and blatant accusations at worst that Liberals=ALL BAD; Conservatives=ALL SAVIORS. It's pure rot.

</quote>

you obviously didn't watch the rally. Nothing political was mentioned in any way shape or form. Keep making yourself out to look like a hateful piece of shit like huggy. Really, keep going.

</quote>

The fact that nothing currently "political" was said means squat. The entire world knows EXACTLY what Glenn Beck represents. Sure, he can turn on the sappy I love America BS and hoodwink his adoring fan club into weeping right along with him. But I'm from the generation where when people said it, they actually meant it, and didn't turn around the following week and say something insulting and ugly against some person(s) who happen to have a different political viewpoint. Glenn Beck doesn't fool me one single bit. AND, neither does Sarah Palin. AND neither does 500,000 supporters who turned out to lap it up.

No sir I will not apologise for my statements. I did not see the whole rally. I did not see anything about the troops. What I saw was crap.

</quote>

I haven't seen any of it yet. I'm sure it will be the top priority of the 24/7 news cycle for at least a week.

I call shenanigans. You clearly don't know EXACTLY what Glenn Beck represents - but it would be quite revealing of what you represent if you stated in plain English what you think he represents.
