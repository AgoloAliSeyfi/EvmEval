The problem with this news article is that it is claiming something that isn't true. The program wasn't an abstinence only program.

Other parts of the study's methodology is flawed. Easy enough to google to discover the flaws but here is one commentary on it.

<a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/robert-schlesinger/2010/02/02/study-shows-abstinence-sex-education-works-but-not-well-enough.html">Study Shows Abstinence Sex Education Works, But Not Well Enough - Robert Schlesinger (usnews.com)</a>

Sorry, Jesus will not be appearing on a dinosaur any time soon.

At least that's what studies show.

while i'm sure mr schlesinger enjoyed taking a swipe at the departed mr bush,
he adds nothing to the debate. no, it wasn't an abstinance only program in the benighted sense of the late bush administration, but it did advocate for waiting until *you* felt ready and strategies for dealing with peer pressure.
i can't access the study, but i would be very surprised and disappointed if the abstinence group did not receive information on forms of birth control as part of the STD curriculum.

as i mentioned in an earlier post, i teach a sexuality course for middle schoolers and we only hope to equip them to make safe, intelligent choices about when and how to become sexually active. it seems to me that dr. jemmott may have made a contribution to that.

That's nice, Del. No one has ever argued that telling kids to abstain is a wrong thing to do. It is a great thing to do. But you know kids, a huge majority of them just aren't going to do it.

So tell them to wait and tell them if they don't what the consequences could be. And tell them if they cannot wait how to protect themselves.

which is precisely what the dr running this study, and i and my colleagues, do. that's all i'm saying.

Fair enough. It isn't you I'm criticizing, it is the New York Time's for their stupid and incorrect headline.

Stupid liberal media.

well, you're half right. they've got stupid down to an art form. i'll be interested to read the particulars of the study when they become available.

the headline really wasn't that bad, but they buried the part where this isn't bush's just say no abstinence program to far down in the story.

i'm not very dogmatic about too many things, but i firmly believe young teens having sex is not a good thing.

i admit my beliefs were slightly different when i was 15, but hey

Silly Del, didn't you know that your beliefs are supposed to stay solid and never changing? &lt;-- is a joke.
