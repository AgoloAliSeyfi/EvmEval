If a legitimate group of survivors families asks for respect, then a religion of peace should honor that.

If they don't, then they're offensive assholes.

They are not asking to clear out all of lower Manhattan of mosques.

What is legitimate?

What about the families who said they didn't mind or even supported the mosque?

</quote>

I guess the families of the Muslim victims who wanted the mosque to be built arent legitimate. In wingnuts mind, they probably helped plan the attack that killed their loved one. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

Of course they helped, do you believe that the Moslems who started this war were alone. I was unaware the families of the Hijackers came together to build a Mosque.

First you'll have to explain what one has to do with the other.

PS: I haven't read through the thread, just the OP.

I don't need to figure it out.

One has nothing to do with the other and the very premise of the question is a non-sequitur.

If others here were stupid enough to take the bait then that's just more of the same.

Hey, if you can't think laterally, or want to be the messageboard pedant, then have at it. Go troll some other thread fool.....

What great victory did the muslims acheive at the sacred Burlington Coat Factory? I ask because I'm concerned that they may have taken over the Pussycat Lounge, two door down.

I worship there regularly

Is that the depth of your argument? Do you know why the Imam chose the building? You are aware that it's being hit on 9/11 was a factor in his decission right? You do know the signifficance of it originnally being the "cordova project" right? Are you aware of Muslim tradition in building Mosques at the site of great victories for Allah? Do you have any idea what that will mean to our enemies, what they could do with it, and why we closed and deported shinto priests who had a shrine near one of the sites attacked in 1942?

Links please.

BTW, just as a side note. If I was to click on your name and check out what forums you post in, they wouldn't be Conspiracy Theory ones would they? If so, I'll bow out now...

If the history of the Shinto shrines in HI from the Shinto shrines will do, including the lawsuit they filed and won to get the property back after the war...

<quote>
By 1941, annual festivals were being celebrated for all three shrines; Kotohira Jinsha, Shirasaki Hachimangu and Otaki Jinja, with an ever-growing membership of over 1,200 families. However, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 threw the whole nation into turmoil. In the worst abuse of government authority in the history of the U.S., more than 120,000 Japanese Americans were interned in relocation camps. Issei leaders of the community in Hawaii were immediately rounded up and sent to internment camps on Sand Island, Honouliuli, Maui, Kaui, Lanai, Molokai, the Big Island and the Mainland.

All religious and cultural activities were terminated as the war continued. In 1943, the interned Rev. Isobe was deported to Japan, forcing officers to call a special meeting on July 21, 1945 to decide the fate of the shrine. Kotohira Jinsha officially announced the temporary closure of the shrine and its activities on April 6, 1946.

After the war, members enthusiastically restored shrine activities on December 31, 1947, despite the absence of a priest. However, the shrine faced another crisis on June 8, 1948, when its property was seized by the Federal Government. An emergency meeting was called and a special committee formed to initiate measures for the return of the shrine and its property.

On March 4, 1949, an announcement for the sale of the Kotohira Jinsha property appeared on local newspapers. The shrine immediately solicited the services of the law firm, Robertson, Castle &amp; Anthony and filed a suit on April 4, 1949 against Attorney General Tom C. Clark, the State of Hawaii and the Federal Alien Land Office.

The case was heard in District Court on May 18, 1950 with a favorable ruling for the shrine. Kotohira Jinsha was once again able to continue all activities at their property in Kapalama. Members jubilantly celebrated the Autumn Thanksgiving Festival on Sunday, October 29, 1950, nine long years since the last festival in 1941

I thought it was pretty much well known. This is not unprecedented anyone believing it is, does not know history very well.

Your inability to refute the truth is nothing to be ashamed of. Afterall, it is the truth and all. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/thup.gif"/>
