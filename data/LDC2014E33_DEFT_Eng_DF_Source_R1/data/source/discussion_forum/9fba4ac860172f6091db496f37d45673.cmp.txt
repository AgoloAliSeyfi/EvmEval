There is a false bit of propaganda circulating that there were no crimes committed and that is why the Obama Department of Justice has not filed any charges. The facts disagree. There was plenty of mortgage and investor fraud committed by the large financial institutions.

By who? Who specifically committed what crimes? Here's a good explaination as to why there have been only 2 prosecutions:

<quote>
Prosecutors seem to have reached the same thought about the Wall Street honchos, concluding that they cant pin a crime even on such seemingly culpable figures as Joe Cassano (head of the AIGs derivatives business), Angelo Mozilo (whose Countrywide Lending mortgages were the embodiment of toxic loans) and Richard Fuld (the CEO of Lehman Brothers). Yes, there was plenty of intentional fraud in this crisis, notes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/26/business/economy/26nocera.html">Joe Nocera</a> in his New York Times column, but it happened streetside, between mortgage brokers and often naïve borrowers, not in the executive suite. The evidence, according to testimony in the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission records, suggests that the white collar offenders Ferguson wants jailed were greedy, arrogant, inattentive, and oblivious. But not criminal.

Here's another place to start with fixing "everything":

<quote>
Through the corporate-funded American Legislative Exchange Council, global corporations and state politicians vote behind closed doors to try to rewrite state laws that govern your rights. These so-called "model bills" reach into almost every area of American life and often directly benefit huge corporations. Through ALEC, corporations have "a VOICE and a VOTE" on specific changes to the law that are then proposed in your state. DO YOU?

I wonder if a thread has been started on this yet? Anyone know?

Pass a Constitutional Amendment rescinding the SCOTUS <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._Federal_Election_Commission">Citizens United</a> decision.

I had no idea you wanted to repeal the 1st Amendment.

Scary stuff if you ask me.
