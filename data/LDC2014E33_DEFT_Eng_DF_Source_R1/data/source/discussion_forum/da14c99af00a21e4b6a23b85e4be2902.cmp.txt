I've never been a real runner, but did jog for years, and strongly agree with Ragman. I'm a fan of the runners world website on shoes (back with a link, it's probably laying about somewhere) and sozobe, while I remember she liked that well enough, found some site to be even better re matching shoes to your feet.

I speak as someone who could barely walk after a trip where I walked a lot in San Francisco for several days - I remember it being wretched to just step off a curb - went immediately to an orthopedist after I got home to LA, and he said "see this arch"? and told me all about it, relative to my battered feet that had been slapping on concrete. That was back in the very early seventies, when running was taking off as a sport. If they had women's running shoes then, they weren't present in my neck of the woods. Following his advice, I bought a pair of the smallest men's Adidas, and my feet were "cured" - they had great arch support plus reasonable cushioning. I started to follow running, even as I just jogged, and read about feet...

I'm hoping the LA Times follows the NY Times and makes its old articles free - there was a series of something like nine articles a year or two ago that were very informative about many aspects on The Foot.

On the other hand, you may have nice medium normal feet and these shoes you are talking about would be fine for you.

BTW, even people with healthy "normal" feet (whatever that is) can benefit from a custom made pair of orthotics and a visit to Sports Orthopaedist -- especially if you're going to be doing walking or running as a regular means of exercise.

I know, Chai, that your interest may not be in running shoes - but this site has some handy info on feet. Once you get see where your feet fit, that may help to see if these special shoes you are speaking about will work with them.

about pronation...

It helps when picking out the right shoes to find out if your feet toe-in or tow-out (laterally) -- supinate or pronate. That way you can choose the right shoe as some shoes benefit one type of gait tendency over the other.

The simplest way to determine this (your individual way of wearing and walking/running in shoes) is to examine an old pair of running shoes and check the wear pattern. Excessive wear on the inside of the front part of the shoe indicates over pronation, such wear on the outside of the front of the shoe indicates supination.

similar comment... what I used to call supination is now called underpronation, at least on my link.

Same difference. Supination = under pronation.

Try not to get too hung up on figuring out terminology as a well-versed athletic shoe store (not often a Foot Locker or typical mall store) will be able to advise you by looking at the wear pattern on your shoes or a well-worn pair of running shoes and advise you accordingly.
