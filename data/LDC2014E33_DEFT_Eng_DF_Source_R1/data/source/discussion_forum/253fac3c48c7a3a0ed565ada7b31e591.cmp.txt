The insurance industry's own institute said premiums would skyrocket. How could they not? If you force them to accept pre-existing conditions and accept other insured's currently not eligible because they cost too much, who is going to pay for that extra risk? You can't legislate risk away. Of course premiums will rise.
The administration is in campaign mode, willing to say or do anything to get this turd passed. The joke will be on House Dems who are being promised a bill to "fix" the problems with teh Senate bill. Anyone who believes that will happen is dreaming. Obama will hang them out to dry.

"Just three years after Medicare was passed, a 1968 Tax Foundation study found that public spending on medical care had nearly doubled in the first few years of Medicare. The report concluded, "To date, the major demonstrable effect of the 1965 federal legislation creating Medicare and Medicaid has been a shift in financing medical care from the private to the public sector. - New York Times, September 9, 1968."

It's the same story today, they selling us story that prices will go down. They wont.

Even LBJ was lying about it back in sixties.

Johnson maneuvered every step of the way getting this bill through Congress, and one of the things he did  and this is a little dicey in today's climate  was suppress the costs. So this young kid gets elected from Massachusetts, Ted Kennedy, in 1962, and Johnson is explaining to him [over the phone] how you get a health bill through. And what he tells him is don't let them get the costs projected too far out because it will scare other people:

"A health program yesterday runs $300 million, but the fools had to go to projecting it down the road five or six years, and when you project it the first year, it runs $900 million. Now I don't know whether I would approve $900 million second year or not. I might approve 450 or 500. But the first thing Dick Russell comes running in saying, 'My God, you've got a billion-dollar program for next year on health, therefore I'm against any of it now.' Do you follow me?"

What unrealistic assumptions?

</quote>

If you're stupid enough to go out and buy a car...pay on it for 4 years....and then pick up your 2010 car from the dealership in 2014, then continue paying for it another 6 years, go right ahead....it acutely describes your utter stupidity....furthermore it clearly demonstrates WHAT A FUCKING SCAM THIS WHOLE GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTHCARE SCHEME IS!!!!. If your too ignorant to see that the whole CBO argument is BULLSHIT because of the pay for 10 years and get 6 years of benefit dupe that the CON MAN President is pulling on you then you are even too stupid to post messages here any further...now there....that's a post you can neg rep me for beowolfe.

Patek, that's only part of it. The deception does not end there.
The bill also assumes savings by cutting Medicare. Every time they have cut Medicare the Congress has voted to restore funding. Why is this going to be different?
But the CBO scoring also is good for just the first decade, when as you say payments precede benefits. After that they admit they can't score the thing.
and there is other stuff in there too that came out at the "bipartisan" meeting.

I just find it unconscientable that the Democrats are bound and determined to commit political suicide with this flawed bill just to say "we won, you lost." This is what it is all about. They could care less what happens to the country or the future generations of Americans...as long as they win.

Welcome to a bullshit high school popularity contest.

The immaturity of you Dem's is pathetic.
