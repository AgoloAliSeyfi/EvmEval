The commerce clause, the 10th amendment, and universal health care would be a court battle that's for sure.

As for your comment

You are trying to make people who don't support government run health care appear to lack compassion. We already have a qausi socialized system. There is already enough regulation to allow for recourse for declining paid for coverage. I am of the opinion that free market forces will allow for greater ingenuity in medicine and lower costs through competition. Artificial monopolies don't work and they stagnate progress. More government involvement will generate more problems.

We simply disagree on what the government's role should be in health care.

In turn, what's wrong with letting an individual state such as New York have government run care while New Hampshire does not? With the residents of New Hampshire not having to pay for New Yorkers' health care.

my post is not advocating for a full government run system. what i am simply pointing out that government regulation can provide an avenue for change. which is what is happening here. there are many good things in the health care law which everyone agrees are good. things like making 80% of premium dollars be used on patient care, not being able to drop patients when they get sick, the removal of lifetime caps, kids being able to stay on their parents insurance until 26, mammograms at no additional costs, the elimination of pre-exisiting conditions. without government intervention then none of this would have happened.

the free market is not always the best solution. look at natural monopolies such as utilities providers. they have government regulated monopolies because it makes more sense logisitically and financially to have one say electricity provider instead of 20 in a given area. look at what the free market did to the financial markets between 2004 and 2008? the lack of regulation cause a huge financial collapse. i have never said the government should run everything or is the perfect solution to every problem. but..... government intervention and regulation can provide a positive avenue for change when the free market is not willing to do so.

health care costs have increased 10 fold since 1990, and the average family is getting squeezed out of the insurance market. all of this due to the free market. how much longer should we wait to see if the free market corrects itself? 10 more years? 20 more?

your notion of letting NY have state run health care but no NH opens a large amount of problems. what if someone from NY travels to NH and gets hurt, but NH will not accept the NY health insurance? so the patient has to be transported back to NY at the possibility of dying. if every state had their own standards of health care, each state would need to have an separate agreement with every other state to accept that states health insurance. if a state is not willing to do so, then you create problems amongst the states. you will have people who will not travel outside their state for fear of incurring costs associated with this. you will also have 50 different form of health care. what if NY had good health care, and NH didnt have good health care, would you allow the residents of NH to cross state lines and improve their health care? would NH be allow to restrict this through law? would people being to flee states due to lack of access to health care?

if you create one single minimum standard that has met, you provide uniformity across the industry. this does not stop providers from exceeding that standard, but it provides a framework with which to start. is this such a terrible thing?

"But what if"...The dumbest question on planet Earth.
It's always "but what if"...
First, your premise is an impossibility. One's insurance is good in one state, it is good in all others. That comes from "Full faith and credit".... <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/search/index.html">Search the entire LII site</a>.
You are blowing this out of proportion.

the what ifs are how things are proposed and passed or not.

what if Iran gets a nuke is part of the discussion in Washington right now. should they ignore that what if? is that the dumbest question on earth to ask?

No, not "as many as they want." It is more complicated than that.
