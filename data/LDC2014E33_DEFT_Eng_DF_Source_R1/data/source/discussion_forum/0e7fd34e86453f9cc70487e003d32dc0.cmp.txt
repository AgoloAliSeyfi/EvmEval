No you're not right, you say every time money changes hands it gets taxed, but you fail to recognize that money earned and that has been taxed will be taxed a second time upon death per the estate tax. Your comparing money that has been earned, taxed, spent thus being earned by another party, taxed and spent again etc etc... not the same as the estate tax at all.

You fail!

And THAT is the debate being had. The 35% on amounts over $5M is the compromise, and frankly, it's a compromise that's slanted incredibly far to the right. But it just ain't good enough is it? No no, we need *NO* estate tax at all.

Tough shit. We live in a society where everyone gets a voice, and this is the current policy. Chances are it will move more to the middle over time.

And stop worrying about it... Nobody believes you're worth $5M so give it up, man!

You know, you're right. Everyone in our society gets a voice. What they shouldn't get, is access to my checkbook by government force. Fuck them! Go earn your own damn living.

It's not your money anymore when you die. In fact the royal "You" ain't anymore after you die. Your wealth is transferred elsewhere. And when wealth is transferred, Uncle Sam gets his cut.

Sorry dude. Rwanda. No estate tax. I'll help ya pack.

well internet access is a pay service so you can try to limit my usage, but it wont work.
now if an heir to a business actually works at the business, then it can be passed on to them without much tax consequence. all you need to do is hire a lawyer and go through the proper channels and paperwork.
but many heirs did not actually do anything to deserve the $ other than being born. lets look at the Hilton sisters. no jobs at the hotel, no college education, nothing but being born a hilton. do they deserve have the family business? what about actors children? or politicans children? or musicians children? they obviously had no hand in creating the family wealth, yet the benefit for the simple reason of being born into that family.

i dont have any dog in the fight. especially since any estates i stand to inherit will fall well below the estate tax threshold. plus my family has basically said they are gonna spend everything "they" earned before they die. which i said more power to them. i didnt feel entitled to their money because im their child. its their money, i didnt do anything to help them earn it.

But what if it were above the threshold and they want to give it to you? Why would you feel the government is entitled to a portion of what your parents earned and paid taxes on?

</quote>

if it were above the threshold, i would be intelligent enough to retain a lawyer and explore the most economical ways to have the estate passed on. there are many legal avenues to limit the estate tax. and since they are not taxing my parents, and this is new money to me, then it has the right to be taxed. im not championing the idea that i like taxes, but with it being new income to my person, it should be subject to taxes.

you got me...I am speechless.good luck in life.

One can alway's choose to go into a life of crime, Prostitution, Smuggling, Drugs, Larceny, Counter-fitting, Embezzlement, Fraud, work on the level of experience, if you really want to go all out, apply it to becoming a Lawyer, Judge, Politician, Union Boss, or Community Organizer. I hear those skills translate real well into a career in Government.
