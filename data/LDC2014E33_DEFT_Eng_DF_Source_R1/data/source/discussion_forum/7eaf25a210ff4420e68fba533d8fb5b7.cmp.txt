I don't think there's anything wrong with unwrapping that present and wrapping it back up. It's not as if you've done it/do it with every present she brings home. You did it because you had suspicions that it was inappropriate for her age based on what you'd seen her friend's parents buy their child, and your suspicions were absolutely bang on the mark. Especially based on that 'Playboy watch scenario' you outlined. There's a thin line between 'looking out' and 'controlling' and I don't think you crossed the line at all.

Now you have some time to think about how you deal with the subject when she opens the present on Christmas Day

I remember being given hair curlers and make-up at at young age by an aunt (young enough that I was still playing with 'baby' dolls) and it was made clear it was not appropriate. My mother broached the subject with my aunt by saying she was using the hair curlers as I didn't understand what they were used for and why and she didn't want me to burn myself, and the make-up would be put in the drawer until I was 'older' otherwise I might smear it all over the carpet and walls while attempting to paint my dolls with it.

I never received a present like it again from that aunt. I didn't feel hard done by at all. As my mother said, I didn't really understand what all that was for anyway.

But my mother got a new set of hair curlers and some make-up that year <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/laughing-smiley-014.gif"/>

I agree with opening the present too, to check its suitability and to give you time to think. I have a friend who openly admits to opening (and re-wrapping <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/laughing-smiley-014.gif"/> ) some of her child's presents from people she doesn't know well, in order to be able to reciprocate with a similar type of present to the child that gave it (i.e. child is given clothes - then you give them clothes back and not a humongous toy or whatever). To me, that makes sense as well. <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/cool.gif"/>

Personally, I wouldn't bring up the subject of the gift's unsuitability with the other Mum after Christmas, as I would probably word it wrongly and it would just lead to people being upset etc... <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/redface.gif"/> The other Mum will probably realise it wasn't terribly well received once she sees that your DD isn't wearing/playing with/doing whatever with the gift anyway, so I wouldn't rub it in by stating it verbally as well.

I agree with the "wait and see what DD's reaction will be" approach, and then see how it goes. Good luck, and keep us updated <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/smile.gif"/>

PS, it's got to be a clothing item, right? C'mon, tell us! <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

I too am dying of curiosity here - but, can understand OPs reluctance to be too specific.
my 5 year old gds love bratz and moxie girls - and to be honest - i dont see the harm - or barbies either! I think thats political correctness taken too far. no one seems to complain about baby annabel - but you could on the grounds of sexual stereotyping! girls love dolls - and the ones which were around when I was a kid (in the fifties) well - they are still around today.
the issues are of sexual influences creeping into kids toys. disapprove of that personally - I wouldnt buy them bunny stuff or fcuk. but am aware some parents do. whether this is of ignorance of the real message or they just dont care i dont know.
but, I think a parent who sends a kid to a party in a public place - should be aware that skimpy clothing and sexy slogans on tops is way out of line. its a come on to peadophiles. they justify attacks by saying the child was ready and wanting it. judging by the clothing.
