Two points.

1) The Democrats looked at the same evidence,and came to the same conclusions.

</quote>

False. They looked at the evidence that Bush allowed them to see.

</quote>

Oh, right. Because clearly, none of these guys who had been around Washington longer than Bush had knew anyone over at the CIA or Pentagon. Because they hadn't been looking at the same intelligence in the 1990's that said the same things.

</quote>

So, because Bush withheld key intelligence that undermined his case for going to war with Iraq, Democrats should have just hit up 'Deep Throat"-like sources in underground parking lots to learn the truth? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

We weren't allies with those countries. Americans didn't want a second war. They thought the first one was a pretty dumb idea. Had the Japanese not bombed Pearl Harbor, we'd have let Hilter win and not really cared.

We weren't allies with Britain and France????

I'm beginning to realize that I've given you much too much credit.

A dictator who wasn't a threat to us, hadn't caused us any problems, and who was actually co-operating with us at that point. And all he had to do was let power go to some crazy Islamists who are already sizing everyone up for Burhkas...

A dictator who killed hundreds of Americans by blowing up a plane over Scotland.

As opposed to a dictator in Iraq who never launched any terrorist attacks against the U.S.

The famous 16 words were correct. The British did have evidence the Iraqis were trying to buy uranium. MI-6 stood by that statement. So it was an accurate statement. they didn't get it, but they asked for it.

Look, guy, George Tenat went into Bush's office and said "It's a slam dunk, Mr. President!"

Joe Wilson wrote in the LA Times that no only did Saddam have WMD's, but we needed to give him a graceful way out because he'd use them.

This is a lot of people playing CYA when something goes wrong. If you had a real job, you see it happens every day in the business world, who ends up holding the bag of dog poop.

Wow, you have totally drank the kool-aid. Next, you're gonna tell us that Saddam was behind 9/11. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

<quote>
Myself. Saddam was a scumbag and I'm glad he's dead. Aren't you?

</quote>

Not at the cost of over $1 Trillion and over 5,000 U.S. military deaths. HELL NO!!!!

</quote>

I believe we lost that many to the days leading to D-day and at D-day. Back then it was a united country..today is weaker because of the self righteous press of Vietnam, Korea and relive a past

</quote>

So? Does that make those 5,000 deaths inconsequential?
