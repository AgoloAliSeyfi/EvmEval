No it's just that people like you can't be honest. It is all about demanding those Taxpayer Freebies. Doesn't matter to me you wont admit that. But it is reality. Take a closer look at their signs and listen to what OWS is really saying. It is all about the Entitlements. They have their hands out and so does Wall Street. And they're not even occupying the right places anyway. They should be in Washington because that's where all the real problems are. OWS and Wall Street are just in competition with each other for their handouts. They stand for the same basic Entitlement philosophy.

Question. You truly believe that the people who have lost their entire LIFE in this economic meltdown by-way of foreclosure, as a direct result of the real sense of ENTITLEMENT and irresponsibility of investors, are in fact similarly motivated? I think there is a broader view of holding people accountable that your conveniently ignore with your argument.

AIG gets bailed out, then gives multi-million dollar bonuses in the very same year. That's entitlement.

Average American has his house foreclosed on by the very banks he is paying to bail out, and wants answers and recompense. Entitlement or accountability and justice?

Common sense tells us that bankers that have to sell their third vacation home are the one's with entitlement issues. Not the people that want them to pay their share of the tax burden which they very much are responsible for.

Why did they lose their entire life? And why is that other Taxpayers' fault. You don't get to demand stealing from fellow Citizens just because your life didn't turn out the way you wanted. That's the same exact mentality Wall Street has. If your problem is with the Banks,then sue the banks and try to get some money out of them. I have no problem with that. But your real problem is still with Washington. They gave Wall Street all that Taxpayer cash. You guys are occupying the wrong places. Get to Washington. But don't demand your fellow Citizens pay for your own mistakes or problems with Banks. We're broke. The Entitlement Gravy Train is off the tracks and out of gravy.

<img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> Yea it does seem that most in the OWS Movement want to blame everyone but themselves for their own mistakes. That's why i can no longer support them. They had it right in the beginning when it was about being angry at Wall Street. I could get behind that. But then it became all about the Entitlement attitude. 'Generation Gimme' stepped in and hijacked the Movement. Now i just see them as Entitlement Whiners. And i think most Americans are now seeing them that way too. Anyway,thanks for the hilarious vid. It is classic.

It's all about the Taxpayer-funded Freebies in the end for both Wall Street and OWS. They want to steal from fellow Taxpayers to better themselves. They're demanding their handouts. What do we do now with this Self-Entitlement Monster? The Well's run dry. We're broke.
