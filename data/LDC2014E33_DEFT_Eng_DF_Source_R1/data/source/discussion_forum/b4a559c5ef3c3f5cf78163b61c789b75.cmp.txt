You're one of many who lack basic knowledge about the end of WW2. The bombs were used to prevent Japan from surrendering through a deal with Russia. Why? The US would have had to share the spoils of war and we were not about to do that. Also, we were never really allies with Russia as our only common goal was defeating the third Reich in Europe.

But feel free to continue calling people an idiot because they say something beyond your comprehension capabilities. It makes you look oh so cool!

Once again you fucking MORON I have the meetings from the Japanese Government. They were never going to surrender to the allies before the A bombs and there were no deals to surrender to the Soviets as the Japanese did not believe they would attack them.

"This memo showed that the Japanese were offering surrender terms virtually identical to the ones ultimately accepted by the Americans at the formal surrender ceremony on September 2 -- that is, complete surrender of everything but the person of the Emperor."

Have you never realized the Potsdam Declaration was designed to inhibit Japan's surrender so the a-bombs could be used?

Was it ethical to use the A-bomb on the Japanese?

If so, was it ethical to bomb both Hiroshima and Nagasaki?

</quote>

I do not know what is ethical about war. I have never considered the ethics of war. I doubt if any soldier even considers this. His main concern is necessity and self preservation.

As to the dropping of the first a bomb...I wonder if any Jap wrote a poem about the excessive sunburn that the population of Hiroshima experienced?

Indeed, that which was of the Sun did shine on the Land of the Rising Sun............

But there are warfare ethics, aren't there? Don't we have them laid out in the Geneva Convention? Don't we teach them at the Naval Academy, etc.?

So the documents relied on by CurveLight are suspect, Samson? I have to admit, I hope that you and RetiredGySgt and namvet are right, and Quartermass and CurveLight are wrong.

This country has enough to feel shame over without a gratitutous A-Bombing or two to add to that black list.
