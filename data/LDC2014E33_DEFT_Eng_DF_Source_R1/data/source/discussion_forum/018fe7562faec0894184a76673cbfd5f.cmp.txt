Do you even pay attention to current events? Or is Fox News your only source of information? Are you just in denial? Does it make it easier for you to dislike him by deluding yourself into thinking he's done nothing at all?

Here is a partial list:

- The stimulus has created millions of jobs in the PRIVATE SECTOR. Even in light of this recent information, repubs still say it was a waste. Not true.

- The unemployment rate dropped from 12% to 8%. (Yes, it's now at 9%, but obviously we are better off than we could have been).

- Obama has made good on most of his campaign promises (as reported by PolitiFact).

- He has killed/captured 5X as many Al-Queda terrorists in his first 3 years than Bush did in all his 8 year presidency. (Don't believe me? Look it up. In fact, I first learned of this fact on Fox News of all sources).

And yet there are fewer jobs now than there were when he took office.

And yet to make this happen, the Feds have reduced the jobs available number by about 2.5 million and that is why the unemployment rate has dropped. Without that change in the formula, the UE Rate is still above 12%.

Close Gitmo, fix the worst economy since the Great Depression, Out of Iraq, out of Afghanistan, open and transparent government, end of crony capitalism, bi-partisan cooperation and honesty. 0 for whatever in most of what he promised.

I suppose this beats trying them in courts. Eliminates the need to read rights if the suspects is lying around in several pieces. The legal and humane way to arrest suspects.

Obama has done more than that. And, he was an incredible state senator and US Senator. Republicans can't get passed the black. You get them calling Obama "man-child" at 50 years old (code for boy) and "magic negro" and so on. The list is endless. They constantly try a lame attempt that Bush was made fun of so it's OK if they do it too.

When you point out that Bush, at one time, was the most popular president in history, they make up even more lame excuses that Democrats were "afraid" of not supporting him. OK, then they did support him. Which was it, they did or didn't.

The Republican Party is 90% white, old and based in the Confederate South. They are acting the way conservatives have for over a hundred years. It's who they are.

They just hate Obama. Many of the things they say are so fantastic, they would never say those things about anyone else. Anti Christ? Really?
