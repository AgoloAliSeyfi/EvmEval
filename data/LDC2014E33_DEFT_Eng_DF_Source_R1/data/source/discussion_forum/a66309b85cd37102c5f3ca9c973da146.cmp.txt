Why, yes. Yes, John, I did pick and choose what posts I put in my response. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that all of those posts by other members who weren't skeptics and were making reference to Paul Freeman's hoaxing preceeded any post that I and then HarryH made. Hello, McFly? Is this thing on?

Your claim:

"The people who were commenting about hoaxing from the beginning were you and other sceptics..."
Oops for you. That wasn't true, was it, John? Shall I post the post numbers and exact times and dates that those Bigfoot enthusiasts like Henry May, Creekfreak, and Reverend Stone made those posts so you can see exactly how long before my and Harry's comments they were? I would just tell any person who isn't banned to just go over and see for themselves but uh oh, Melissa turtled her board and put all new accounts on preview. Oh noes... mehbeh more skaptiks r cuming.

They were not disrupting the thread like you were. I should have said disrupting and not commenting. Strone only said he will make up his own mind and did not mention hoaxing. And I find it hilarious that you would quote and use Creek Freak to defend yourself, especially since you attack him constantly for being a hoaxer. So I guess that we can say that YOU support a hoaxer too right Kit? Hypocrite. So that leaves Henry and he only mentioned it, he did not disrupt the thread.

You mean another Bigfoot enthusiast who posts in another Bigfoot board felt uncomfortable with me pointing out exactly what such a massive collection of casts by Freeman implied? For example, that he would have casted at least 26 individual Bigfoots in his small area alone?

No I mean an administrator from the largest Bigfoot forum noticed you acting like a troll as you normally do.

Being warned by a Bigfoot enthusiast groupie for pointing out the obvious in a civil manner in discussion where the comments are perfectly relevant worries me not.

And acting like a troll, scoftic will get you banned, and it did.

Actually no. John. I'm simply pointing out that your claim that no ABS member tolerates hoaxers is simply a fantasy. It's not about whether or not casts are evidence of Bigfoot. That's solely your opinion, not in line with that of Meldrum, Melissa, and a throng of other Bigfooters, and a diversion tactic to try and steer away the conversation from your claim.

It is all about opinion and yours is no more relevent then anyones. including mine, silly boy.

I don't think it was a travesty that Melissa kicked me out.

Neither do most of the members there.

Says the guy who repeatedly ignores requests to address the simplest questions regarding his sighting while engaging in the topic he complained about as OT.

I've lost count how many times John ignores this:

You are confusing ignore for disregard.

Go ahead and ignore me, John.

John- You abstained from voting for the banning of Kitakaze. And you act like it was a gesture to show that you didn't really want him banned.

I'm just curious what your voting record is on past bannings. Have you voted to ban people before?, Have you abstained before?, Have you voted not to ban people before?

Abstaining from voting in this case, might be a big deal if you always vote yes or no, on banning, but it wouldn't be a big deal if you ALWAYS abstain from voting for banning.

It doesn't sound like you're saying you were the one that lifeted Bateman's art. BTW, this is not the first time there's been an issue about Melissa's site using art without permission, is it? That's rhetorical, you don't have to answer.

What I know is that it ended up being a major league catfight for many people myself included and I wasted mucho energy trying to stay out of it last year so thats about my input on it.

I won't go even more OT with MABRC or NESRA stuff but I really like the head of your group, Chris Bartow. I've had friendly and helpful discussions with him in the past.

</quote>
Actually Chris is one of four board members for the Group, as am I just to clarify but i appreciate you not dragging Nesra into this subject, it really has nothing to do with them. Matters with Anderholm are considered ancient history also, fwiw.

It was not in support of his troll behavior. I just do not support banning anyone and would not do it unless someone threatens another member. I was content to just edit his posts. Some people do not have the patience for that and he was banned.

I have not been involved with any other ban of a member there,we have not had any since I was a Mod or Admin. The majority of the members can behave like adults.
