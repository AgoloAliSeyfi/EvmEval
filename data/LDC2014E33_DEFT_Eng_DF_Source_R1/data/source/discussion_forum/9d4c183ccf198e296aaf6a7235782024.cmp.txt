Recent stats show approximately 50% of women aged 15-44 have at least one unplanned pregnancy in their lives.

So the Republican Party wants to force half the women in America to have an unwanted child.

So the answer is to KILL THAT MANY CHILDREN???????????

I had an "unplanned" pregnancy.

My hubby and I wanted to wait until he finished college before having kids.

Didn't work out.

We were the adults. We made the kid.

We weren't going to make the kid pay for our "unplanned" pregnancy.

We did what we had to so the kid could be born and supported.

Did it EVER occur to you morons that the way to avoid "unplanned" pregnancies before marriage is simply say NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Sure as hell worked for me!

Liberals!

There is no such thing as being responsible or taking responsibility for one's actions.

Nope! Their answer is drag a kid out with a vacuum and cut it in pieces while it's still alive!

LIBERALS! DISGUSTING IRRESPONSIBLE VERMIN!

great you made a personal choice that worked for you. That personal choice doesnt go beyond the players in that situation.

But then again i am quoting a social conservative hypocrite

</quote>

I would LOVE to hear how you figure I'm a hypocrite.

This is gonna be good! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/new/lmao.gif"/>

Notice liberals keep throwing accusations my way WITH NO EVIDENCE??

That's the definition of a liberal that's LOSING THE ARGUMENT.

They want to desperately put you on the defensive, and they hope something will stick and put you on the defensive.

It's so obvious! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/new/lmao.gif"/>

As for "that choice doesn't be beyond the players."

WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?

That abortion goes beyond "personal choice" because the Democrat party is so invested in it?

What does that mean?

This rationalization, I have just GOT to hear!

I'm sharpening my claws now. Be my guest!

Okay, YOU are full of it and a liar!

You let me know when you have evidence otherwise.

This is why you got banned from Hannity. This crap.

You are the biggest paid liar on the internet.

On top of that, how would that be misogyny, even if I did do it, which I didn't, I'M A WOMAN YOU MORON!

Now we have three sock puppets. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/new/lmao.gif"/>

This is why liberals are double and tripling down on Palin.

Same reason. They are terrified of a conservative women who can kick their asses.

They don't know what to do.

When they stop even discussing the issue in the op and just start making baseless accusations and insults, you know you have won the debate.

But then I knew that several hours ago. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>
