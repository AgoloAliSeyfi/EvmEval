It's been a while since we've reviewed the mainstream science resources and references regarding climate change, and there have been many new additions and revisions over the last year or so. Additionally, several recent posts seem to be posing questions and referring to contarian pseudoscience arguments. Such can be confusing and misleading without knowing and understanding what the science says about such issues. To that end I thought I'd add a few links and descriptions of some of the mainstream references that help us to understand the issue of climate change.

We'll start with:
"Climate Stabilization Targets: Emissions, Concentrations, and Impacts Over Decades to Millennia" - <a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12877#description">http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?recor...77#description</a>

Description

Emissions of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels have ushered in a new epoch where human activities will largely determine the evolution of Earth's climate. Because carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is long lived, it can effectively lock the Earth and future generations into a range of impacts, some of which could become very severe. Emissions reductions decisions made today matter in determining impacts experienced not just over the next few decades, but in the coming centuries and millennia.

According to Climate Stabilization Targets: Emissions, Concentrations, and Impacts Over Decades to Millennia, important policy decisions can be informed by recent advances in climate science that quantify the relationships between increases in carbon dioxide and global warming, related climate changes, and resulting impacts, such as changes in streamflow, wildfires, crop productivity, extreme hot summers, and sea level rise. One way to inform these choices is to consider the projected climate changes and impacts that would occur if greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were stabilized at a particular concentration level. The book quantifies the outcomes of different stabilization targets for greenhouse gas concentrations using analyses and information drawn from the scientific literature. Although it does not recommend or justify any particular stabilization target, it does provide important scientific insights about the relationships among emissions, greenhouse gas concentrations, temperatures, and impacts.

Climate Stabilization Targets emphasizes the importance of 21st century choices regarding long-term climate stabilization. It is a useful resource for scientists, educators and policy makers, among others.

Climate Change Remains a Real Threat to Corals

ScienceDaily (Oct. 13, 2010)  Hopes that coral reefs might be able to survive, and recover from, bleaching caused by climate change may have grown dimmer for certain coral species, according to new research by University at Buffalo marine biologists published this week in PLoS One.
The research shows, for the first time, that while hard corals can take up from the environment new stress-tolerant algae that provide critical nutrients, the coral may not be able to sustain the relationship with these algae over a long period, a process known as symbiosis.
The findings may mean that certain types of coral will not be able to adapt rapidly enough to survive global warming, says the study's lead author, Mary Alice Coffroth, PhD, UB professor of geological sciences in the College of Arts and Sciences.
"Our findings suggest that not all corals can maintain a long-term symbiosis with these stress-tolerant strains of algae," says Mary Alice Coffroth, PhD, UB professor of geological sciences in the College of Arts and Sciences and lead author.
"That's the problem," she says, "if they can't take up the stress-tolerant symbionts, or if they take them up but can't maintain the symbiosis with them, as we found, then they likely won't be able to adapt rapidly enough to survive global warming."

Talking to a friend in Australia who I sent photos of a couple of possums in our composter.
She said... "I had no idea marsupials were found that far north" ( Ontario )
I said "Yup when I was a kid, Pogo was a Georgia possum hanging out with alligators....."

When I found one under my porch 10 years ago....climate change got very real......
Critters know.....even when H Sapiens go into denial. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/mazeguycartoons/garfield.gif"/>

In sticking with earlier comments, this is a link to the recently updated EPA climate change site:

"... <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/downloads/Climate_Change_Science_Facts.pdf">Projections of Climate Change</a> At the current rate, the Earths global average temperature is projected to rise from 3 to 7°F by 2100, and it will get even warmer after that. As the climate continues to warm, more changes are expected to occur, and many effects will become more pronounced over time. For example, heat waves are expected to become more common, severe, and longer lasting. Some storms are likely to become stronger and more frequent, increasing the chances of flooding and damage in coastal communities.
Climate change will affect different regions, ecosystems, and sectors of the economy in many ways, depending not only on the sensitivity of those systems to climate change, but also on their ability to adapt to risks and changing conditions. Throughout history, societies and ecosystems alike have shown remarkable capacity to respond to risks and adapt to different climates and environmental changes. Today, effects of climate change have already been observed, and the rate of warming has increased in recent decades.
For this reason, human-caused climate change represents a serious challengeone that could require new approaches and ways of thinking to ensure the continued health, welfare, and productivity of society and the natural environment..."
