Today, I had a really hurtful comment said to me. A few months ago, Id have broke down in tears but today I didnt. A teacher called me ugly today.
I was thinking about surgery and have for the longest time. I have always been really insecure but then recently I've felt grateful. Im always comparing myself to others and what I have noticed is that not all BUT alot of pretty girls are arrogant. Even when they are funny, smart etc, they are often self absorbed and critical of others. Ive even noticed that some of them appear to feel like their main "worth" is their looks. (if that makes sense)
Ive developed a good personality, have lots of friends but Im ugly/average. If I wasnt ugly, I may have been like some of these girls and thats the ONLY thing thas has ever helped me with my insecurities. I probably would have a completely different personaluty and I would probably be a completely different person, obviously physically but also mentally.
Sometimes, I still cry. Im often treated as inferior to other girls because of how I look and people do make comments even if its not intentionally. But for once I feel grateful. i dont think if I could have been born didfferently that Id want to. Anyone else feel like this?

No one is ugly my friends, God created everyone according to his will. The beauty is in the eyes of people who look at you, I'm sure you'll find someone who finds you very beautiful in your life.

Tell your teacher to piss off. He or she should be teaching not checking you out like a paedophile

your TEACHER called you ugly?
I'm pretty sure you could complain to the head about that.
Teachers are meant to be there to support you.. not cause stress and upset..

I commented on a show we were watching and the presenter. I mentioned absolutely nothhing about her looks. And he(my teacher said), well your not exactly the prettiest girl in the world, as if it was relevant. I didnt know what to say. Everyone went "ooooo" and I pretended not to care. I was just glad I didnt break down crying. I know I can get him into alot of trouble especially cos it was so uncalled for.

Thats the same as me!! I was bullied in secondary school cos I wasnt one of the 'popular' girls who always had bfs and were basically slags. I wasnt unpopular (i had a great group of friends) I didnt wear make up in school because I didnt see the point. and cos of that people were horrible and called me ugly.
Its made me who I am today. I dont think im ugly at all and quite often get complimented on how 'fit' or 'pretty' I am.. Im not stunning by a long shot but thats not the point lol. I do wear make up now and make an effort but I feel better in myself knowing that I can go out without make up and still feel confident wereas all the girls I went to school with have some kind of nervous breakdown if they dont look 'perfect'. Who the hell cares at the end of the day?!

Exactly, i had great group of friends too. They were the popular ones but im the only one left behind because i was also busy with my academics and extra curricular activities. LOL i was laughing when i realised something that were too young to wear make up in secondary school anyways. <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.png"/> I started wearing make up at age 19.
until then, i liked putting make up but not too much. It just makes me feel better when i go out. Im not beautiful that a guy will look twice when they pass by me. At least we make ourselves feel better and not affected by those insecure girls who wear tonnes of make up. <img src="images/smilies/h.gif"/>

People who make comments on other peoples appearances are generally insecure with their own, so take no notice because at least you are more secure than they are.
