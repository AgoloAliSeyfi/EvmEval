Curvey's only resource is some nut-case-historical-revisionist.

Please check your InBox. I'm grateful to you, and so you have a present.

So you're relying on Samson to tell you my sources instead of asking me? How much sense does that make? One source is an article from August 1945:

"In an article that finally appeared August 19, 1945, on the front pages of the Chicago Tribune and the Washington Times-Herald, Trohan revealed that on January 20, 1945, two days prior to his departure for the Yalta meeting with Stalin and Churchill, President Roosevelt received a 40-page memorandum from General Douglas MacArthur outlining five separate surrender overtures from high-level Japanese officials. (The complete text of Trohan's article is in the Winter 1985-86 Journal, pp. 508-512.)"

Samson claimed my "only resource" is barnes when in fact I've never referenced barnes at all. So you just thanked Samson for outright lying.

What Journal is this CurveLight? Now I am determined to know what the fuck is the deal with these competing documents. Give us the complete citation and I will ask my research librarian to pull it for me.

Thankies.

Madeline, have you ever responded to the fact our top military leaders all agreed the bombs were not necessary?

CurveLight, I am not the arbiter here. All USMB-ers get to have the same weight given their opinions. I'm just asking questions because I'm dumbfounded that there is (apparently) disagreement as to the historical facts.

Once again you fucking MORON I have the meetings from the Japanese Government. They were never going to surrender to the allies before the A bombs and there were no deals to surrender to the Soviets as the Japanese did not believe they would attack them.

"This memo showed that the Japanese were offering surrender terms virtually identical to the ones ultimately accepted by the Americans at the formal surrender ceremony on September 2 -- that is, complete surrender of everything but the person of the Emperor."

Have you never realized the Potsdam Declaration was designed to inhibit Japan's surrender so the a-bombs could be used?

Curvelight's "source" is Mark Weber's IHR Article.

Let's see what Good Ol' Mark is all about, shall we?

Mark Weber:
<a href="http://www.adl.org/holocaust/weber.asp">The Professional Denier</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

More than any other propagandist, Mark Weber, 45, embodies the Holocaust-denial movement. An articulate, media-savvy spokesperson with a master's degree in History from Indiana University, Weber got his start in the radical right in 1978, when he took the position of news editor for National Vanguard, a publication of the neo-Nazi National Alliance. In 1979, Weber also began to contribute regularly to The Spotlight, a weekly

tabloid produced by Willis Carto's Liberty Lobby organization. His involvement with the IHR also intensified steadily over the years; initially working as a contributor to the now-defunct IHR Newsletter, Weber began serving as emcee for the group's annual conventions in 1984. In 1985 he became a member of IHR's Editorial Advisory Committee and in 1992 he became editor of the Journal of Historical Review. Following IHR's break with Carto and the subsequent departure of most professional staff members in 1993, Weber became director of the organization with one professional staff person serving under him.

Ahh, yes.

Only those as hopelessly stupid as Curvey would use Weber as a resource. Maybe he has a National Enquirer Article he'd like to present with more credability? Perhaps some Alien in the form of Elvis has an opinion about Ethics and The A-Bomb that Curvey would like to share!! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Well CurveLight? Is this true? You've relied on reporting by a discredited man?
