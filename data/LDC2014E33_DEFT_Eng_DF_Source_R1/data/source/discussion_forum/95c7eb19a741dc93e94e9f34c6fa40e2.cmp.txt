I too was a bit disappointed. I really wanted to see Neville's parents and the entire hospital scene. Someone said earlier that it didn't flow and it looked like a sequence of scenes, I didn't understand what they meant until I saw the movie. In the beginning in the playground scene, it felt like I was watching some indie film, the cinematography for me was kind of strange. The possession part was done well and I think they made it seem like Cho was in their year. The fact that they made Bellatrix use the killing curse (green) as a opposed to the stunning curse(red) made it seem like they wanted to get across that sirius was dead. And if JK said the mirror has a role why didn't they mention it. I realised that the movies are just the basics of the Harry Potter plot. They leave out so much which in fact was what draws us to the HP books. We spend time debating on the little mysteries of HP but the movies will never be able to portray all this.

I loved the film. Yeah its disappointing when they get rid of what are important scenes but there is no way they can fit everything in. Its hard but I try and view the films as a separate entity.

Luna was amazing, exactly how I thought she'd be. Wasn't too impressed with the ministry, was expecting a bit more than that.

The main problem for me is the actors are getting old. Don't suppose you can stop that though.

Can't wait for the boooooook....

well after reading Deathly Hallows and this film, there will be some inconsistencies:

This is in a spoiler for that that have not finished or started the last book:

Spoiler:
There was no mention of Regulus or his locket in the film so that will be a problem for the film to cram in that or they will remove it (They like to say adapt)
The mirror that Sirius gave to Harry in the books is needed in book 7 but they removed that as well in the film so that will be changed
Rant over but Umbridge was done really well and I suppose it foreshadows her later involvement with the Death Eaters in the MuggleBorn Registration Commission. Nonetheless knowing them, they will also cut that as well <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/hmph.gif" alt=":hmph:"/>

Very Disappointed. Felt like shouting out to the whole cimena to read the books instead and that this was the tip fo the iceberg.

And i agree witht he persona pew posts up. The guy who played Dumbledore in the 1st film was PERFECT. Pity he passed away though.
I also agree, this dumbledore is waaaay too hasty and angry.

Agreed with Gambon being a far too aggressive Dumbledore. I don't think he's been convincing enough to be able to play Dumbledore in the final two books; we learn so much more about his character in those.

About the locket - I think they'd just make out that it was in the Black household without having mentioned it. Or they may now put it into OOTP somewhere?

They also didn't show Lily (iirc) in Snape's worst memory, so I don't know how they're going to manage the whole Snape/Lily storyline.
