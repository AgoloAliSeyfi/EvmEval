7% shareholder..... and you're seriously gonna continue to pretend he 'runs' FNC? Even an idiot can see the numbers don't add up.

I despise willful stupidity. Pathetic spinning and whining instead of using basic logic... you're making yourself look ridiculous.

Even a hyper-partisan dunce like yourself should realize that although normally 7 is a low number in percentage, in ownership of companies such as FOXNEWS it reflects a large percentage of influence.

From your own quote earlier, he's the second largest shareholder.

Snap out of your partisan stupor and smell the roses.

He got FOX to scrub any references to Saudi cash backing Al Qaeda. Heck..even Bush scrubbed the Saudis from the 9/11 commission report.

Saudis are the puppet masters of American conservatives.

And, the influence that it shows happened is that the Saudi's request to change the description of a protest as a Muslim one to a civil one was only done after it was confirmed that it was not just Muslim.

Oh, the horror of such influence.

Which is pretty much the same as any other influential group trying to influence media... say, like the Color of Change organizing email campaigns to sponsors of right wing talk show hosts.

Influence... people have it, people use it. I see nothing of import in that. Of course, I'm not an hysterical lying race baiter.

Yes, it is.

And, this thread is so very childish. It reminds me of when I was a child and my little brother would complain that someone else's cookie was microscopically larger than his.

We usually traded with him to stop the incessant whining about such non-consequential minutia.
