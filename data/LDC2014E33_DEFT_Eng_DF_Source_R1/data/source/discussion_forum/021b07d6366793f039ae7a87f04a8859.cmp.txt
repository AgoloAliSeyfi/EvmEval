SPENDIUS- WROTE:

Re: The Pentacle Queen (Post 3676759)
There's a famous book on the subject Queenie.

By Richard Hofstadter. I own a copy. How could I be expected to resist a title like that. A first edition. Slightly foxed.

Bernie (blatham), of blessed memory, used to rave about it.

It seems that if you help denigrate anti-intellectualism it flags up that you are an intellectual. It's known as the RIC. (The reverse invidious comparison.)

The book takes about 400 pages to say what Veblen said in one sentence.

But I'm not sure the professor knew what "intellectual" means.

What a great phrase, Spendius--The reverse invidious comparison.

I think it would explain most of the PIOUS statements by the far left.

e.g. Anti-Intellectuals are stupid--(Therefore I am a brilliant Intellectual)

Intolerant Caucasians are evil( I am a tolerant Caucasian--therefore blessed.

Greedy Capitalists hurt the poor( I am not greedy therefore I love the poor)

I will remember the phrase, Spendius--the reverse invidious comparison!!

@genoves,

I invented it myself. It's short for "rictus".

"spendi doesn't understand evolution" is code for the poseur to claim he does.

Which is hilarious.

When are you going to help me out in the teaching evolution threads? It's great fun.
