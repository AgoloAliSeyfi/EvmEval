Amnesties are a complete disaster, it sends a message to everyone in the world saying 'You can come to Britain by any means possible, legal or illegal, and you will be neutralised (legitimised). They should be resisted at all costs, and however impractical or expensive, the problem needs to be dealt with properly, and if that involves imprisoning people for illegal immigration and building more prisons, so be it.

“The Liberal Democrats… would allow asylum seekers to work, which would be a fundamental mistake given that 83 per cent of asylum seekers are found not to have a genuine claim.”
Alan Johnson, home secretary, BBC Politics Show, 25 April 2010

Fewer than a third of failed asylum seekers told they were going to be deported in 2008 were actually removed from the UK that year.

As a result, the taxpayer has been forced to pick up a massive bill for supporting the failed claimants while they remain here.

Last year, the Home Office spent £73million on support such as housing for failed asylum seekers, compared with only £4million in 2003-04.

The Conservatives, who unearthed the figures, said yesterday that it was clear the asylum system was still in chaos.

Immigration spokesman Damian Green said: 'This is a terrible picture of a system which is still not fit for purpose.

The UK has a number of problems, illegal immigration, legal immigration that displaces British jobs and changes Britain's culture, the welfare state. Asylum is only one part of this, albeit a small part. Your argument is like saying to someone who needs to downsize a company "There is no seen to downsize my tower because it's only a small tower of 3,000 employees compared to that tower over there that has 9,000 employees. It's a non argument for inaction."

In response to all your other comments what right have you to say to the British "You must open all your borders to the world because mass-immigration has to be good." Don't the British people have the right to say on this. And 70% of them say that mass-immigration must stop. That should be the call for action to stop it. Full stop. Why should the British people be propagandised by some madman, Hitler, of governments I 50 years ago who were not very nice to black people, and be politically railroaded/ brainwashed/ propagandised/ bullied into saying “We must have free borders or we are fascists.” No, the British people have free will and their free will must speak. (Not the will of some radical madmen liberals with global communism ideas or minority community spokesmen).

70% of the British population say that mass-immigration must stop. (So please no one do the typical dishonest reply about a lunatic white minority).

The British people must DEMAND their voice, their platform and they will have it.

Thanks for your references to the Daily Mail to support your argument: that supports what I've said above.

The British people already have a platform: they can vote. If they really were that against "mass immigration", they'd vote for one of the anti-immigration parties. They haven't.

And you still haven't answered how much an asylum seeker actually gets in benefits: quoting how much is spent on them doesn't answer the question.

Just as America has the native americans; England has the English.

Just so you know, people like you aren't the voice of "white people" either. You're the voice of a guardian reading, self loathing minority that lives in middle class safe white suburbs peeping over your ivory tower and just loving all the vibrancy and diversity. Sincerely doubt you or your kids would have had much experience of the joys of multiculturalism first hand as a minority in school. Unfortunately this liberal bourgeouise elite calls the shots though and decides what is right and wrong to think for the rest of us. Don't like being a minority in your own country - so what? We're safe in our suburbs.

It's almost like a bizarre new form of hybrid racism and classism where white working class people are seen as vile racist brutes, for bemoaning their new coming status as an ethnic minority in major cities.

LOL, I think the problem is also the education in the UK. I notice a lot of resentment because people in the UK have to pay 20k a year to go to public school and into university, a lot of people just can't do that. I paid nothing for my education, and so did all the europeans and south americans that came to the UK with degrees.
