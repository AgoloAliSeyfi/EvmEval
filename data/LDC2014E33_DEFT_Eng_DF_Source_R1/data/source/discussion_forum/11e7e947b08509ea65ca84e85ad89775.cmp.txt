About 80% of them have already.
For instance if we made cars without robots it would take 10X the manpower to produce what we now produce.

Actually, it's people who build the robots since not enough are being made tocreate an assembly line. It's people who make the precision parts the robots are made from. People who design the robots. People who are the technicians to maintain the robots. People who install and program the robots. People who design the parts the robots make.

All that takes "education". Something Republicans "mock". Odd that.

Training people to be engineers is different from making them watch an Inconvenient Lie in the name of education.

honestly it will be awesome when humans become more like robots (programmable). it is really assine that you have to spend 20+ years (1/3 to 1/4 of many people's lives) learning stuff that is already written and that millions of other people already know. what its figured out how our knowledge is stored in our body, and then they figure out how to write to/modify it, you could litteraly just scan books worth of knowledge into yourself or say copy all of wikipedia into your brain. Imagine if everyone starting at 5-10 years old was capable of PHD level research. what kind of breakthroughs would their be in math, science, and engineering?

Humans are already programmable.
Most are programmed quite well.

Wally World stocks more cheap stuff than just about anyone else. Most of the crap is made off shore in Asia, or some other place where they can realize the highest profits. But, I don't hear the masses bitching about the lack of jobs. Most Americans are just to dumb to realize that their way of life is going to be changing for the worse and we are barely seeing the results of their apathy. Until Americans can stem the flow of US greenbacks down, and slow the tide of cheap off shore junk coming in, having Hamburger Helper may start to seem like a celebration.

I suspect we are going to see the standard of living, for blue collar workers, to plummet even deeper. In the meantime, these BCWs will stop at Wally Workd for a new Chinese flat screen so that they can look at their REALITY shows, basketball tournaments, etc at 1080p.

Wonderful.

I'm no real fan of Walmart, but their marketing strategy is not to make the MOST PROFIT as let's say the oil companies....

Oil is not all that attractive with respect to profits.

Is that for retail sales of finished product only or covering all aspects of the oil industry?

Exxon/Mobile has a profit margin that is nearly 300% higher than Walmart's profit margin...

When I saw that they consistently ran at around a modest 3.6% profit margin, is when I stopped bashing walmart for their profits....

do you know who benefits from profits? Shareholders. Do you know who shareholders are? People like you and me.

Buy some exxon stock and you will soon learn to love profitting.
