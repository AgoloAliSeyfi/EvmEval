Not all newspaper articles at the moment are peddling the catastrophe line. Here's one for George and Thomas

Climate change impact disputed

David Adam, science correspondent

Here is the truth about global warming: it is an anti-capitalist agenda, a Machiavellian political plot and a convenient rumour started by bungling Japanese pineapple farmers. It is a front for paranoia about immigration, an incitement to civil war, and the reason that the world's attention was distracted from the risk of a tsunami. And it hasn't killed as many people as Hitler or Stalin.
Welcome to the UK's first dedicated meeting of climate change sceptics, where the consistent message is that global warming will not have a catastrophic effect, and if it does there is little the world can or should do about it.
The meeting, held yesterday at the Royal Institution in London, was billed by organisers as "a valuable opportunity for debate on a topic frequently obscured by angst and alarmism". Climate change, they said, was a topic "that has been subject to widespread misrepresentation and politicisation".

One other thing readers might want to do here is look up the term 'hipsothermal' on google.

Turns out, you only need to go back a few thousand years and you find an age in which temperatures were significantly warmer than they are now, with no human high-tech or diesal motors or anything like that in sight.

.... which is why I keep telling you that rising temperatures are not the problem; it's the instability thrown into the weather system by our pollution and the areas we are raising the temperatures in.

Hotter summers, colder winters, longer droughts, longer monsoons, the risk of hurricanes that are much larger than normal... Climate instability is scary stuff.

mctag's quote from the guardian : " Here is the truth about global warming".... i think it's hilarous when writers (particularly science writers) start their article like that. i winder how they know that 'it is the truth' ? i agree with cyclo; it's the climate instability that's worrysome. of course, i can't contribute anything scientifically, but listening to a scientist from environment canada (david phillips - sp ?) over the years, i think what we need tobe concerned about is 'groundwater contamination'. phillips (?) appears on the canadian weather t.v. quite frequently to talk about long range weather forecasts (and their in/accuracy - he jokes about it). he has stated on a number of occasions that he believes that we can adjust to moderate climate changes, but he believes that once we contaminate our groundwater (which is taking place all the time) we'll have a hard time dealing with it. even contamination from detergents (which cause the so-called 'gender benders' ) are a very serious threat to the well-being of humans and animals. hbg
