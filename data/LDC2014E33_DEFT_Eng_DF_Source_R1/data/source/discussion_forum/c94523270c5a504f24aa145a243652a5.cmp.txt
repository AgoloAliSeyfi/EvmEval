RetiredGySgt, in a rather lazy fashion repeatedly points to The National Security Archive 's collection of 77 documents on the atomic bomb and end of world war 2 saying 'the proof is in there'. Rather like tossing a dictionary at a newspaper editor and saying 'here's tomorrow's front page story'.

So where in the comprehensive 77 lengthy sections could that magical, much sought-after golden fleece-like 'good reason' to consign the 350,000 civilian population of Hiroshima and the 250.000 civilian population of Nagasaki to the horrors of a nuclear blood bath be hiding?

Perhaps it was Document 29, where on 11 of July Foreign Minister Togo sent the following 'extremely urgent' message to Ambassador Sato:

"We are now secretly giving consideration to the termination of the war because of the pressing situation which confronts Japan both at home and abroad Therefore, when you have your interview with Molotov [ in accordance with previous instructions] you should not confine yourself to the objective of a rapprochement between Russia and Japan but should also sound him out on the extent to which it is possible to make use of Russia in ending the war."

and then on the same day:

".. Japan- as a proposal for ending the war and because of her concern for the establishment and maintenance of lasting peace - has absolutely no idea of annexing or holding the territories which she occupied during the war."

These Documents reveal many desperate attempts by Japans envoys to establish a surrender up to the very end and on August 5th (Document 52). All the while U.S. interceptors secretly listened in, and made Truman's office aware of the full content of these Japanese attempts yet they went ahead anyway, choosing to test one of each type of their new atomic devices, first Uranium, then Plutonium on the living Human guinea pigs; the old men, the helpless women and innocent children behind enemy lines, away from the theatre of war, away from where the soldiers were. America sneaked in, from a safe height and in cowards fashion dropped their devastating bombs on non combatants then ran away.

And as President Harry Truman ate his lunch on the Augusta with fellow mass murderers Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin, news of the bombing of Hiroshima came in. Jubilantly, he announced to the retinue of sailors around him..

"This is the Greatest thing in History!"

It has always bothered me that we bombed cities full of non-whites, but not Germany, where the Death Camps existed. Maybe the A-Bomb was not finished before VE Day. Maybe.

But the US confined Japanaese Americans to internment camps and did NOT do so as to Italian Americans or German Americans.

It seems to me there must have been a tremendous temptation to drop the A-Bomb SOMEPLACE, just to show the world what we had. Without using it in warfare, who would ever believe this gruesome weapon even existed?

All these things, together with the second bombing, have made me uneasy. I WANT to believe Truman's decisions were ethically defensible. His comments to those around him do not offend me. It's understandable that he wanted VJ Day at any cost.

But still the doubts persist -- that we bombed a couple of Asian cities and killed millions, instantly or later by radiation poisoning, because we COULD and not because we had no other choice.

I don't know what my Daddy saw or knew. I lost him when I was quite young, and like most WW II vets, he would never discuss what he'd been through. But my Mommy and Daddy were pinkos. They sympathesized with or actually joined the American Communist Party. I rather think if he'd been all good with Truman's decisions, Daddy would not have been such a radical after the war.

Germany surrendered before the nukes were ready but even if that were not the case we would not have used them in Europe because Russia did not pose the same threat for post-War in Europe as in Japan.

Regarding death camps, we didn't bomb those because as a Nation we were anti-Semitic to the point that many quietly thanked the implementation of the final solution. We even turned away Jewish refugees seeking asylum in the US who were eventually killed by Germany. Some claimed we didn't know about them and even if we knew we had no way to get bombers to their locations due to distance. Bullshit. There are ariel photos showing we were bombing around the gas chambers.

There are two main reasons we suddenly became pro-Israel in 1945. The first was creating a nation in the ME the West could use as an entry point to resources in the region. Keep in mind, about two generations before WW2 the British Empire created the nation of Iraq. Literally, both by borders and name. Maintaining control was very difficult with so much geographical isolation. Enter Israel.

The West now has a geographical advantage but more importantly, it obtained a geopolitical goldmine that is still in use today.

The Japanese had several negotiated settlements on the table. None of them conformed to the conditions set out and agreed to by the allies.
