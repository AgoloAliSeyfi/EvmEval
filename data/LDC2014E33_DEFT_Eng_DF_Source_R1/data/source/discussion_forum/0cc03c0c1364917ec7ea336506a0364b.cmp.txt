As I asked, where's the 6 trillion dollars in that graph?

The Bush admin added 6 trillion dollars onto our national debt. Your graph does not show 6 trillion dollars. Therefore it's a false graph.

Bush's tax cuts for the rich cost us almost a trillion dollars of deficit spending. Bush never paid for those tax cuts.

You think a trillion dollars is puny?

You think it's cryasses bitching and moaning about deficit spending?

What happened to fiscally responsible Republicans?

That's the myth that's been busted. There's been no such Republicans since the Reagan admin.

what about his tax cuts for the middle class and poor? i'm not rich and they saved me $2400 last year.

</quote>

seriously, i've tried to tell uber libs this and they can't accept it. at the time i was in school and not making a lot of money, yet i got the tax cuts (actually rebate). the old guy next to me on a fixed income, partial supp income, got the tax cuts, and on and on.....ironically the old guy, a repub, thought it was stupid as since he was single, what the darn hell is $600 bucks going to for him....

the fact is, the tax cut/rebate he gave both times put money into mostly the lower to middle class folks. if you made over a certain amount, you didn't get the bush rebate.

most libs accept this, but the uber left continues in denial

A rebate is a rebate. Everybody got one.

A tax cut is a tax cut. The millionaires got one.

Obama campaigned on getting rid of wasteful spending.

</quote>

Then he turned around and signed a nearly $1 trillion un-stimulating succubus package and an omnibus bill with 1,500 pet pork projects in it.

....Pants on fire.....

</quote>

Actually, it was $800 odd billion for the stimulus. But don't let a little thing like 'facts' get in the way of a good rant. So, proceed.

Didn't figure in the interest that'll be due on it, did you?

You have a crystal ball?

Too bad you didn't have that back in 2004, you could have told your fellow righties not to vote for the debt doubler.

Why didn't we hear about the deficit during the Bush

</quote>

Which rock were you living under?

</quote>

Point me in the direction of all those tea baggers who were out there screaming about the Bush deficit spending.

<img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

</quote>

Why do you think Bush's poll numbers were in the 30's, and bad through most of his second term given the fact that we are pretty much a 50/50 nation. I'll help, it's because right of center people were angry about Bush's spending.
