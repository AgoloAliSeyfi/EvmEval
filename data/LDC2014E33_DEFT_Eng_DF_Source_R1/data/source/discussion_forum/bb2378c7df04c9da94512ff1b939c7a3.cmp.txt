Okay, so what should Obama have done for small businesses, in your opinion?

</quote>

Day one he should have told them thatthe Bush Tax Cuts woulkd be extended to all.

He should not have cherry picked who got stimulus money.....for any small business trying to compete with another small business that got money had no shot in hell. The stimulus should never have been instituted.

He should have announced on day one that the whole cap and trade thing will not pass under his watch....

He should have thanked all business owners for their perseverence and hard work...not viliified them.

He should have done one of two things....either wait until next term to pass healthcare...or allowed business owners to know exactly what it will cost them...something many of them still cant figure out and wont be able to figure out for 2 more years.

Thats a start.

He extended the Bush tax cuts

Yes...he fianlly did...but didnt agree to do it for the business owners until the last minute....and low and behold....jobs are starting to be created.

That is part of being a democrat. Therefore, there are two sides to the issue.

The private sector saw an increase of 2.5 million jobs under the stimulus.

Yet there are 1.8 million jobs less than when the stiumulus was passed. I explained how that happened in an earlier post. Many companies went OOB becuase they could not compete with companies that got stimulus money...and the companies that got that money hired some of those same people that lost jobs when the conmpetitor went under

Villified them? That is complete hyperbole.

yes..he villifed them. Have you EVER heard him talk about the great financial risk one takes when they start a business....when they hire an employee.....did he EVER mention that the last TWO employers of record of an unemployed individual contribute to their unemployment benefits....But we have heard the words "greedy" and "fat cats" and "unethical" come out of his mouth when referring to business owners.

You may have a point about the healthcare bill.

And the same point holds true about cap and trade.

True, but Obama has done a lot for small businesses:

1) He extended loan programs for small businesses.

2) He established an initiative for small businesses in rural areas.

3) He was half successful in trying to eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses.

4) Create a $3000 tax credit for businesses adding jobs

5) Raise the small business investment expensing limit to a quarter of a million.

He is in bed with unions &amp; the big business who employ them. He hates small business because they tend to be non union &amp; harder for the IRS to track tax revenue.</a>

The thing about biased sources is basically this: "That may be true, but so is this..."

Therefore, I don't take sources like that seriously.

</quote>

My sources are my clients.

I am their business planner/human resource solutions consultant.

I know what held them back for the first two years of Obama's tenure..

And I know why some are loosening up now and doing what they can to hire.

Many of them aren't against Obama...many like his social initiatives.

But NONE of them feel good about him as it pertains to their business.

Not a single one of them does.
