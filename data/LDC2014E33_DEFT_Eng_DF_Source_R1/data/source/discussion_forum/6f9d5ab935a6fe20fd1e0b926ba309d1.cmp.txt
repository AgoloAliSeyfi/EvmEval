Hello,

I have two mortgages.

1. Joint mortgage (with Mrs G) on family home.
2. My own mortgage on a rental property I bought last year (small flat)
(3) Mrs G also has a small mortage on a 2nd rental property

I have just taken a mutually agreed redundancy package which in effect means I have walked away from a job with 10months salary in my back pocket, meaning in turn that though I am out of work there is no short term risk to the mortgage.

also... Mrs G can easily increase her earnings, she is a NHS contracted nurse who has only worked part time the last few years, she is already increasing her hours and could go as far as treblling them, meaning in turn that even a small increase to her earnings could mean my stretching out the ability to gaurantee the mortgage payments for far longer, probably 18 months.

plus... I have some savings products maturing in the next couple of years, which if I use... would mean I could guarantee the mortgage for far longer even than 18 monhts

plus... of course we could sell the 2 rental flats... however my cash flow is better with them then without since the rental income more than covers the mortgages on them

Plus... Finally.... I am starting my own business and less than 1 week in look like I am well on the way to securing some clients... 4 Clients upwards and my earnings are back where they were.

So... at this point I see no reason whatsoever to inform any finance institution of my change in circumstances, but can the Forum members confirm... am I obliged to inform them regardless? |

What do I have to tell them... if anything at all, how does my credit rating get affected if I notify them. (I have been in full time employment for 25 years).

this same question applies to the following:

Mortgage providers(2)
Credit Card companies (3)
Personal Loan provider (1 personal loan)
Banks (2)

Thanks

You have no obligation to inform any of the institutions mentioned anything about your current circumstances.

Good luck with the new job !! Just use Martin,s website to save every penny you can over the next 18/24 months.
You will need 3 years of accounts to prove income if you want to remortgage so build up savings and pay down debts

No need to tell them at all. <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/smile.gif"/> It's only relevant if you apply for a new mortgage, as others have said. Insurance is the only financial product I can think of where you have to tell the company about changes to your circumstances (and then only things that are material to the policy and their underwriting decision). They chose to lend to you based on your application, which was accurate at the time. They've entered into the mortgage contract with you now - they can't change that decision (unless you stop paying!).

I was made redundant unexpectedly three months after buying my first place, and I'd taken out a 100% mortgage. That was a slightly terrifying time!
