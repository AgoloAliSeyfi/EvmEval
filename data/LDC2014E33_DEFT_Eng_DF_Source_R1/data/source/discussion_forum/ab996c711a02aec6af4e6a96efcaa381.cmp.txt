It's the biggest, hottest news story in media.

Are they not a media company interesting in keeping the populate updated on the latest and greatest and hottest news?

Any of you wager to guess why such little coverage for the biggest, most powerful media organization on the world?

Its because their demographic thinks the shooter did the right thing.

You see, they are a bunch of morons. Its so simple really.

I believe you're spot on.

You can bet your bottom dollar on that. The black dude would have been in jail the second the cops arrived on the scene. It would have never even gotten to the point where The FOXNEWS would have had to setup their communications center there. Excellent points Zoom.

I'm watching that very part of MJ right now, I tape it daily so I can watch it later. Well, looks like Black Kid Hunter Zimmerman finally got what he always wanted, a kill under his belt. I hope he's happy w/himself.

I'm not seeing any justification for the title of this thread. This story is very active on Fox.

I'm also glad that Hannity seems to be a thorn in your side.

Does your so-called intelligence cause you to hurl so many senseless insults there skippy?

Since you seem to support mindless violence without the effort of due process, I view you as a race baiting asshole who cares more about creating hatred than promoting justice.

I don't engage with mindless 'hate' and those who promote violence as an answer when they don't get their way. Child.

So far the worst of the race baiters have been unable to come up with anything that says Zimmerman shot Martin because he was black. Not one thing.

</quote>

You honestly think that didn't play into it Katz?

</quote>

Nope. Not a single thing. For one thing, this area is majority black. If Zimmerman was going to target blacks, he'd be doing it every day all day. If he was a racist, he wouldn't be living there in the first place. There would be a long history of expressed racism. There isn't. The only act that the race baiters have is that Treyvon Williams is black. George Zimmerman is hispanic, but BUT for purposes of accusation he's white.

The area is majority black? I read somewhere it was like a little over 30% black, does anyone have a link for this?

Fox can't find a way to blame ACORN. Once they discover that smoking gun, they'll be on it.

The beady eyed one is a good lister. The homosapien, barely, has a knack for listing off things that bash Obama and his Administration. I'm sure the lapdogs and lemmings just lick it up, off the ground and all. He just prattled off a list of things/people that Obama blames for the gas prices. I've seen him do lists of all sorts of things like this. What a putz.

He must be doing something right... #1, he's pissing you off and #2, he's doing a lot better that Rachel madcow in the ratings.
So I guess you're double pissed. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/clap2.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/clap2.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/clap2.gif"/>

He's doing a lot worse in influence, and he's a total failure in facts.

How, precisely, does 'everyone know that'?

You create your own reality if that makes your life easier. I shall remain in the real one, where I cope exceptionally well.

This is the wrong thread for this. But what I don't understand is how you can have such a strong opinion and know nothing?

Look, do a search using the phrase, "Prince Alwaleed bin Talal protects Murdoch against hostile takeover bids" and then pick which source you want to "learn from", because deary, you really need to learn. Rupert Murdoch only owns 30% of News Corp. A hostile bid is a lot easier going against 30% then 37%. And while you're at it, find out why Rupert is investing in the Prince's middle eastern network.
