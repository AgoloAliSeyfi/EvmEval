WBC is getting sued by a grieving parent. What the fuck law or act (of Congress or of a state) is even implicated?

Freedom of speech has never been understood to restrict the ability of people to sue other people for things like libel and slander. It cannot be properly understood in that way, in fact. Only the so-called "1st Amendment 'absolutists'" think in such ridiculous terms.

So if a citizen can sue another citizen over something said or written, then why can't a citizen sue another citizen for the intentional infliction of emotional injury caused by the outrageous CONDUCT of the party getting sued? If the plaintiff succeeds in the lawsuit at the SCOTUS level, there will have been ZERO violation of the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech.

The fucking scumbags of WBC will merely have had their depraved, disgusting and outrageous behavior properly called into account. They remain perfectly free to express their idiotic beliefs either way.

Fuck them. God hates them. I know. HE told me so. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cool.gif"/>

How much free speech will anyone have if someone can sue anytime they are offended?

I like how free speech rights all point to protecting objectionable speech. Free Speech was meant to protect a political minority from the majority in getting their message heard. It was not meant to protect pornographers, hate speech against a minority or politically motivated attacks on a small group of private citizens, who are not even part of that discussion.

Some speech is simply unnecessary to the ends of a political debate. I expect that the ruling will fall on the time tested principle of liberty up to the point it displaces the liberty of another.

So, if I print up a political track that talks about sex in a graphic manner, that is fine, but if I leave politics out, is isn't? How exactly is that supposed to work?

They can't sue just because they are offended and that was not the basis here.

They heard it after the fact Quantum. Harm seems to have been established in the lower courts. I think drawing a bystander into a political speech for your benefit and the other private party's harm is the key here.

Harm from deliberately seeking out offensive material. that is like me going in the store and asking for a Hustler, and then demanding my money back because it contained pornography. I don't think that will fly.

The point was, free speech many times IS protecting something that is objectionable for no other reason than that. I fail to see how political discourse is harmed in its true form by dropping the pretense that objectionable stuff can protect the other.

Slander is action against against an offensive statement that claims to be true. The statement that God killed Mathew Snyder because he hates fags, and demonstrates that hatred by killing US soldiers who defend fags, is extremely hateful, and demonstratively offensive, but I doubt it meets the legal definition of slander. The jury had the chance to hit back at a bunch of despicable people for a horrific belief, but those beliefs, and their right to express them, is a fundamental right in this country. You may not like it, but it also helps you say the exact same type of thing about Phelps and his church.
