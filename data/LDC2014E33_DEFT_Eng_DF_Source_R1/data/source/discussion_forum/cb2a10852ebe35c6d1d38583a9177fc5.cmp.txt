I absolutely agree with you on the 14th Amendment. Of course, the TPers claim Obama took total control of all medical care in the country, so I'm sure it doesn't take much imagination to know what they would claim if he had gone the 14th Amendment route. Still, would have been nice to see.

I see him compromising on the pipeline just like he did with the tax cuts for the wealthy. The GOP has proven they will destroy families in order to get what they want. Obama really has no choice.

They sure have.

Reid declared the bill DOA anyway so hopefully he won't give Obama a chance to cave. If the payroll tax goes back up 2% to it's original amount, it would suck but it wouldn't be the end of the world to me. Let the GOP Obstructionists play their game. If it's going to hit them in their wallets, they'll eventually scramble and draw up a clean bill.

So you support the continued fleecing and bankrupting of SS.

The cut has been ineffective., But as long as you get some welfare its good right?

</quote>

Ineffective? First off, I thought conservatives believed any and all tax cuts are good. They always create jobs, always. Second, we've had private sector job growth every month since the cut was in place.

What world do you live in?

There's a switch, huh? A conservative in favor of letting taxes increase....to fund SS no less.

What you already said...

...is the biggest reason for me. He and his admin. have also shown they're not much better than the Repubs when it comes to the big banks.

</quote>

Yes, and what I find so bizarre about it is that Repubs are constantly trying to paint him as this liberal extremist. I mean that charge is just so patently false.

</quote>

Agreed. In fact, one of my disappointments is that he has not been liberal enough! Specifically, a larger stimulus was needed and a public option should not have been taken off the table.

</quote>

trillions of the stimulus was given to banks overseas !!! yeah lets give em trillions more !! libbs are idiots !!
