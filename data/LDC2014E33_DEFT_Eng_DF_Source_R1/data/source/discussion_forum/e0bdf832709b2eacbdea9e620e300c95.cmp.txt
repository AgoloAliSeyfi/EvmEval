That, however, of course was yesterday.

Meanwhile, the Chief Labour fundraiser was arrested in the investigations into the cash-for-peerages scandal. Lord Levy is a close friend and ally of Blair's, and Labour's fund-raising activities were co-ordinated by the PM's inner circle. Even Labour's own treasurer is said to not have been informed of what Levy had been up to. It is "inconceivable" that he could have acted without Blair's knowledge and consent, said SNP leader Alex Salmond.

[My] summary:

<quote>
The chief fundraiser for the British Labour Party has been arrested by police probing allegations state awards had been given in return for cash, according to media reports. Labour came under pressure after it said it had received nearly 14 million pounds of loans from 12 businessmen, some of whom were nominated for seats in the House of Lords afterwards.

2006/07/13, The Daily Telegraph

All of which leads Hoggart to ponder in The Guardian:

<quote>
How weird it must be to wake up every morning and be Gordon Brown. In those half-asleep moments he must check for aches and pains, judge the state of his bladder, and ask himself whether he is prime minister yet. Then a spasm of annoyance as he realises that it was all a dream; the shouts and yells next door are from the breakfasting children of the man who is still prime minister!

At that time, dreams, nightmares and reality merge together. When he came to consciousness yesterday he must have dared to think that the prize for which he has waited so long is about to fall.

Why, we expect Mr Plod to turn up at Number 10 any moment! "Very sorry to trouble you, prime minister, but as you know, in our job we have to be tough on crime as well as the causes of crime."

"I fully understand, deputy assistant commissioner, or may I call you John? A mug of tea, perhaps? Or a peerage? Ha, ha, just a little joke!"

The chancellor is now in the position of a man who has been waiting, praying and hoping for his curmudgeonly old father to die so he can inherit the title and estate. But the police have been called in. There is talk of fraud, of massive bills, of the chief accountant turning up in Rio. The whole kit and caboodle may be worthless! He might be about to inherit what an American politician once called "a pitcher of warm spit".

And today, the Observer asks:

There is increasing panic in the Labour party as the investigation into cash-for-coronets gets ever closer to the PM himself.

Thanks Walter, interesting.

These reader comments come closest to my feelings about it (tho note that I'm using the word "feelings", not "thoughts"):

Titanic versus iceberg analogies come to mind. One wonders just what the unseen underwater spear of ice that will finally hole and sink this rotted-out hulk of a government will be, and where it will come from...

it is only when all these corrupt, shameless Nu Labour androids are out of power and out of politics will the party ever be worth supporting again. And that includes closing the revolving door between Number 10 and big corporation directorships.

Dear chris32uk

There may or may not be "powerful, deeply right wing forces in this country, deep within the establishment and media, who would do anything to try and bring the Labour government down." If these forces are so powerful why have Labour now won 3 elections in a row? No, the truth is New Labour has dug its own grave (and those of quite a few Iraqis incidentally). Why not buy some popcorn, settle down into a favourite comfy chair and watch Labour self-destruct. Its going to be quite a show - and it is entirely, entirely self inflicted by this deeply dishonest government.

It is a tragedy that in 1997 the country was ready for Labour policies what they got was more Tory ones.

Tony Blair wanted Britain to look big in the world. But being a satellite of George Bush is making him and us look small

<a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foreignaffairs/story/0,,1832308,00.html">Tony's totally awesome adventure</a>

[..] Today, after meeting George Bush to discuss the Middle East, Tony Blair comes to California, the first visit by a serving British prime minister to this fool's paradise. [..]

Blair will meet Californian aristocrats such as the Schultz family [..] and meet kingmakers like his old friend Rupert Murdoch [..]. On Monday he'll meet Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa [and] he may even get a glimpse of Arnold, as Schwarzenegger and Blair both attend a forum on the environment on Tuesday.

And who knows, Tony may even hit the surf. But why California?

"The reason," the No 10 website helpfully explained, "is that there is a crisis in the Middle East and the prime minister wants to get as far away from it as possible."

Actually, it didn't say that. Instead, it explained that California "is the sixth or seventh-largest economy in the world... which is similar to ours in that it is a new economy increasingly based on heavy knowledge-based industries". [..]

Tony, some things you should know, dude. There really is very little similarity between California and the UK. [..]

10. Things not to mention: earthquakes, drought, fires, Charles Manson, George W Bush, Enron, the Lodi terrorist cell, Richard Nixon, the death penalty, how hot it is in England, Warren Beatty, the prison system, immigration reform, Ohio, looted antiquities, smog, the price of petrol, community farming, New York City.

And the Middle East.
