Unfortunately many religious groups seem to be of the opinion – although we must careful not to generalise, that they possess a privileged position in any society 'not to be offended'. Indeed, the Danish cartoon which is mentioned in the article is a prime example of this – whereby some people think it is acceptable to bomb embassies just because their representative country values freedom of speech. “Meanwhile, the European Union has offered to host the next meeting of the so-called Istanbul Process, an aggressive effort by Muslim countries to make it an international crime to criticize Islam.” And where would that end? People need to understand that religion is like any other matter and it should not be given a special privilege; would you make it illegal for a man to criticize hip-hop music or any other form of entertainment? Of course you wouldn't, such a notion instantly strikes you as absurd but there is no logical reason as to why Islam or any other religion should be treated differently. In fact it is counter-productive to a certain extent, if all international criticism of Islam is banned – then how does the religion, if at all, expect to progress socially and be able to respond to those criticisms? It would just stagnate and eventually decline due to people's alienation from deep conservative traditions which may no longer be relevant to modern living.

Clearly you are the racist here, ignoreing the fact thete are lots of white muslims in europe - you claimed to be one yourself- or did you forget?

Out of all the religions honour killings are by far most prevalant in muslims families - the vast majority, this is not coincidence - please provide a link of a buddhist being convicted of this crime in the whole of europe.
This is not a ethnicity issue at all however youd like to make it- there are millions of chinese koreans and japanese ethnicities in europe - how many rpeorted convictions of honour killing have those communities incurred. Compare that to the muslim population. How thick would you have to be to ignore that

"Jews are not a race either but that didn't stop the Nazis from killing all of them"
What does that even mean ? <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/>

Explain why about 1/3 of them in the UK are Hindu and Sikh.

Yes but the Istanbul Process has been going nowhere for last 10 years becuase each time the muslism countires put forward a proposed resolution- it is put them that the laws against causing religious insult would also apply to their own peoples (anti western anti semitic protests and the like) and the discriminatory laws many of them have in relation to non islamic religions - which obviously they are keen to reserve the right on. Hilary clinton is chairing the next on i think and has said she wants to redirect the process away from restriction of freedom of speech and toward anti incitemnet to hatred type resoultions - which is effectivley what we have in this country

While precise figures do not exist for the perpetrators' cultural backgrounds, Diana Nammi of the UK's Iranian and Kurdish Women's Rights Organisation is reported to have said: "about two-thirds are Muslim. Yet they can also be Hindu and Sikh"[48]

Also read the whole section on India. Are they doing it because of Hinduism, or because of their culture?
And South America.

I can't blame them for trying this, the bias in our media is evident to most and truly disgraceful. However it's freedom of speech etc etc <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>
