Were you dropped on your head as a baby? No, seriously, were you? My father-in-law gave my son his father's (f-i-l's dad and my sons great grandfather) shotgun. It was a family posession handed down from generation to generation. Should my son have been taxed by the government for this family gift? It doesn't matter if it is a gun, a family picture album, a doily, your old man's fishnet stocking leg lamp or his monetary fortune. You posess it and it is yours to do what you choose with it. Why the fuck should the government be entitled to take a portion of my hard earned wealth I want to pass to my son so they can give it to some crack whore mother so she can have things she didn't work for. Hell, if she wants some of my money, she can come ask for a handout. I'm a very charitable person. But I decide how and where my money goes. I don't need the gubmint being the middle man. If you decided you need a piece of my financial pie and went about coming in my house to confiscate it for yourself, I'd be justified in a court of law for putting a nice grouping in your chest to stop you. Why should the gubmint be able to do by force what citizens are not allowed to by gubmint law?

Get it thru your head. A person's possessions belongs to them and they can do with it what they will and can give it to whoever they choose. You are not entitled to it if they don't want you to have it and the gubmint shouldn't be able to take it by force and give it to you. If they do.......what are you going to give in return?

gifting and estate taxes are separate issues. and since the gun falls under the limit, its not taxed anyway. try again......

also, if you wanted to legally pass on your estate and it was over the $5M threshold, go hire and lawyer and he will be able to limit the estate taxes. stop making excuses.

Making excuses? Wouldn't that be you thinking the government is entitled to part of a person's estate? You've never explained why the government has a right to it other than they can make rules and enforce them at gunpoint. Why is the government entitled to it? You've never answered that. This is income that was taxed when it was earned that has been passed to a family member......no different than some other possession. Why is the government entitled to it other than it is easy pickings and they can send people to your house with guns to get it?

all income is taxed multiple times. every time it changes hands it is taxed again. your taxed on your income, then again on the sales, then again on property, then again and again. its the same as you winning the lottery, its free money to the person who receives it. an estate also doesnt necessarily have to be passed on to a family member. should your neighbor or friend get it tax free as well? whats the difference there?

Not by the same entity. Yes, I pay federal and state taxes on each pay check. When I go to the grocery store with the money I earned that the government actually allows me to keep, I pay a LOCAL sales tax. My property taxes are to the COUNTY. Now, if I were being taxed on my income by the feds and then paying a federal tax at the gorcery store, you might have an argument. The federal government already got a piece of the action each time I get paid. If I choose to give money to my son, they are not entitled to retax what they already taxed.
