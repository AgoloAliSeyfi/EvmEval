Doctors have told me I have a full thickness rotator cuff tear and must have surgery or my shoulder will freeze. Looking for information from anyone who has had it or with someone recuperating. I have heard the recovery is brutally painful. Any tips, suggestions, etc., about what to expect during first few days, how to manage, sleep, any info.

Have not had surgery but did have "frozen shoulder". That was no picnic. It took 6 months of twice weekly physiotherapy (very painful) as well as bi-weekly visits to a chiropractor and exercises at home twice daily before my arm was back to "near" normal.

I hope someone else can give you first hand advice about surgery. I can't give an opinion either way. Just wanted you to know that the alternative is far from pleasant.

I had it done three years ago at Johns Hopkins. I had suffered low grade "bursitis" in one shoulder for many years (probably a worn rotator cuff), until one day while working out I got a real, full tear. Lots of serious pain with some movements or any strenuous exertion.

My surgery was successful, but it took me several months to regain my range of motion in the shoulder. I learned that the post op therapy is probably more critical than the surgery itself. I was determined to restore the range of motion and to return to my old exercise routine, so I in effect took charge of the rehab program and made it clear to the therapist the Orthopedic Surgeon that I wouldn't accept less.

In retrospect I believe this was the critical thing, in that the Docs. and the therapists take their cues from the patient -- if you passively accept less than full recovery, they will let you go. If you are determined to go on, they will help.

I have full use of the shoulder and no more pain. I would do it again.

I hope this is helpful and wish you good luck !

I've had a torn rotator cuff in my right shoulder for several years, but it wasn't diagnosed until two years ago during an MRI. I decided to do nothing about it as I could tolerate the pain and minor movement restriction ( have so many physical disabilities that one more pain was no big deal.) At age 78, I didn't want to undergo such difficult surgical recovery.

My decision has worked for me so far---keeping my fingers crossed that my shoulder won't freeze up. A couple of cortisone injections each year seem to help.

Hope it all works out well for you.
