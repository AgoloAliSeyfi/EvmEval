I'm so sorry you're feeling like this right now. You seem to be feeling very desperate for some kind of a solution to the situation; you say you feel you're life is over. It isn't, although I can relate to these feelings of desperation, that probably led to the self-harm. You probably feel like there is no other way to deal with what you're feeling right now, but I hope you can see that overcoming all this is an option. I think that feelings of self-blame may have also led to your self-harm; you describe feeling terrible and you may want to almost punish yourself because of the so-called 'mistakes' you have made.

However, please remember that though these emotions are natural responses to what has happened (other people will have felt them many times before you), they are not necessarily the right ones. Although your emotional response may be clouding your judgement right this minute, you should realise that you are being too cruel and hard on yourself. The situation is going to be hard enough to get through - don't make it any harder by not loving and respecting yourself.

I understand and do appreciate that this boy has formed a very important part of your life and that you must have become very attached to him. Whilst it is a wonderful thing to be able to connect with another person, sometimes this can blind us and we don't realise they are hurting us. I may be completely wrong here but I feel that you may have been letting him dominate you too much and define your self-worth a little too much and I don't like the way he effectively cheated on you/ wasn't 100% faithful to you by sleeping with this ex when he was with you, and then blames you for sleeping with this male friend of yours when he has breaken up with you. That's not right or fair and I think it's unhealthy for you because you're blaming yourself when he's effectively made a bigger mistake. You must know this deep down; you realise that he has hurt you more than you have him when you say 'how can he care he effectively broke up with me?' You deserve someone that is going to be firstly faithful to you and secondly respect your choices, should they choose to break up with you. He may have some very good attributes, and you may have passed some good times together, but realise that he has also been hurting you and you do deserve bettter - this fact should help you get over him. Why would you want to be with someone who cheats on you and makes you feel bad about yourself? He is just one chapter in your life; if you have been with him that long, and already another guy is interested in you, I'm sure you will have a fair few more romances in your time. I think you can get through this, and that you can use the bad experiences (as well as the good ones) to your advantage.

Bottom line: Stop hating and harming yourself when you have nothing to feel bad about! Learn to love and respect and care for yourself. Stop idealising this character who has, when you look at things carefully, hurt you a lot. I'm sure you will get through this the same way many other people have succeeded in doing.

Thank you so, so much. I swear you know the situation. You are completely right. He's been making me feel terrible for doing something which I'm completely free to do, and which he seemed to be advocating by saying he couldn't see me as anything more than a friend. He can be very unfair and hypocritical. When he slept with his ex the last time I somehow ended up being the one begging him to come back.
I really appreciate you taking the time to write this xx
