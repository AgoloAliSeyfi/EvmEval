I have one of my old university lecturers on Facebook, and their statuses really rile me. They're a militant socialist (just that would be enough to annoy me) and make several posts a day against the cuts. They're arguing against cutting legal aid, getting rid of final salary pensions because apparently that's too similar to the private sector, cutting sickness benefits, amongst a host of other things. It makes me livid. These things are all necessary to cut in order to rein in the excesses of a socialist government, and these people on the marches do not give a fig to the care of future generations when a catastrophe like Greece would happen in the UK because they don't want to compromise their comfortable lifestyles afforded by the taxpayer.

Maybe some socialists can help me understand. Why do you not care about the future generations enough in order to compromise our lifestyle now to secure their future?

It's somewhat about public opinion as well.

It would be a lot easier to a few big cuts early in tenure than it would be to do many small cuts here and there throughout the entire tenure. In 2 years most of us would have forgotten how things were before the cuts and for the most part almost everyone would be used to things with all the cuts and maybe even see the overall benefits of it...... hence people feel good about the government and the Tories get elected again to power......hopefully.

It's not targeted at the poor though. Public spending is predominantly on the poor because that's where the money is needed, so when they cut spending back, the poor get hurt most. The government don't really spend on the rich.

Absolutely, I really do agree. The debt the coalition inherited for the Labour government is huge. It will take generations to pay it back. If it's reduced quickly, then this will make it easier for our children, grandchildren etc.

I just hate the public sector anyway!

Well, you may have a point. That said, I think scrapping so much stuff (the harriers, destroyers, Ark Royal) was a disgrace. It wouldn't have cost anything to just keep that stuff in storage for a few years in case we needed it.

Tony Blair's government and indeed Gordon Brown's were Labour governments. They were not socialists in my opinion. No socialist government would have engaged in the Private Finance Initiative, kept the union laws passed by the Tories, and kept the privatised railway network.

I've always thought this generally about people who oppose the cuts. What do you suggest we do instead? The fact is we've borrowed and spent too much money. Either we have to make cuts or raise taxes, or probably both.

Perhaps the cuts will plow our economy into the ground? Reducing our GDP will increase our deficit.

I am not opposed to cuts. I am opposed to how some of the cuts are being done. The poor are getting bitchslapped in some cases. Some of the disability reforms are shocking.

<quote orig_author="lovely_me">
I don't know a single person who doesn't agree we need cuts. However, many leading economists have stated that cutting public spending by such a drastic amount in a short space of time may actually have an adverse effect and stagnate the economy. That's what people are concerned about.

The Tories only seem to care about their decreasing the public sector ideology and seem to have little care for what the consequences for their drastic cuts of the economy are.

Cuts are necessary, it's just a shame it has to hit the poorest people most. The pain could be equally shared by putting up taxes for high earners. looking at the way the cuts are being managed at the moment, WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT ALL IN THIS TOGETHER!

If you do that, you'll just make the rich go elsewhere which doesn't help the situation at all.
