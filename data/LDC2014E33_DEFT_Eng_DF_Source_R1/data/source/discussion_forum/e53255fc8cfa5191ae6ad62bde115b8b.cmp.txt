There's a reason why people don't follow the Qu'ran to a T any more...

Slightly off topic, but can anyone explain these for me? These are all quotes from the Qu'ran that I consider to be very sexist.

1. A husband has sex with his wife, as a plow goes into a field.

The Quran in Sura (Chapter) 2:223 says:

Your women are your fields, so go into your fields whichever way you like.... (MAS Abdel Haleem, The Qurâan, Oxford UP, 2004)

2. Husbands are a degree above their wives.

The Quran in Sura 2:228 says:

... Wives have the same rights as the husbands have on them in accordance with the generally known principles. Of course, men are a degree above them in status... (Sayyid Abul AâLa Maududi, The Meaning of the Qurâan, vol. 1, p. 165)

3. A male gets a double share of the inheritance over that of a female.

The Quran in Sura 4:11 says:

The share of the male shall be twice that of a female.... (Maududi, vol. 1, p. 311)

4. A womanâs testimony counts half of a manâs testimony.

The Quran in Sura 2:282 says:

And let two men from among you bear witness to all such documents [contracts of loans without interest]. But if two men be not available, there should be one man and two women to bear witness so that if one of the women forgets (anything), the other may remind her. (Maududi, vol. 1, p. 205).

5. A wife may remarry her exâhusband if and only if she marries another man and then this second man divorces her.

The Quran in Sura 2:230 says:

And if the husband divorces his wife (for the third time), she shall not remain his lawful wife after this (absolute) divorce, unless she marries another husband and the second husband divorces her. [In that case] there is no harm if they [the first couple] remarry.... (Maududi, vol. 1, p. 165)

6. Slaveâgirls are sexual property for their male owners.

The Quran in Sura 4:24 says:

And forbidden to you are wedded wives of other people except those who have fallen in your hands [as prisoners of war]... (Maududi, vol. 1, p. 319).

7. A man may be polygamous with up to four wives.

The Quran in Sura 4:3 says:

And if you be apprehensive that you will not be able to do justice to the orphans, you may marry two or three or four women whom you choose. But if you apprehend that you might not be able to do justice to them, then marry only one wife, or marry those who have fallen in your possession. (Maududi, vol. 1, p. 305)

8. A husband may simply get rid of one of his undesirable wives.

The Quran in Sura 4:129 says:

It is not within your power to be perfectly equitable in your treatment with all your wives, even if you wish to be so; therefore, [in order to satisfy the dictates of Divine Law] do not lean towards one wife so as to leave the other in a state of suspense. (Maududi, vol. 1, p. 381)

9. Husbands may hit their wives even if the husbands merely fear highhandedness in their wives (quite apart from whether they actually are highhanded).

The Quran in Sura 4:34 says:

4:34... If you fear highhandedness from your wives, remind them [of the teaching of God], then ignore them when you go to bed, then hit them. If they obey you, you have no right to act against them. God is most high and great. (Haleem, emphasis added)

10. Mature men are allowed to marry prepubescent girls.

The Quran in Sura 65:1, 4 says:

65:1 O Prophet, when you [and the believers] divorce women, divorce them for their prescribed waitingâperiod and count the waitingâperiod accurately... 4 And if you are in doubt about those of your women who have despaired of menstruation, (you should know that) their waiting period is three months, and the same applies to those who have not menstruated as yet. As for pregnant women, their period ends when they have delivered their burden. (Maududi, vol. 5, pp. 599 and 617, emphasis added)

i havent got time to answer everything but i saw these and knew they were taken out of context lol, ill just go for the inheritance one....
the Quran says it is the males responsibility to look after the family, one can then argue if its fair or not to have that responsibility put on you!....but because of that responsibility he will receive that wealth amount. looking more into the website you took it from it says :

"This Islamic law is regressive. In the US, for example, inheritance is divided equally among all siblings, regardless of the gender. No religious law prohibits this from happening "

but the jeiwsh law on inheritance says : if a man dies, his possessions are divided by his sons. His wife can either take her Ketubah or can live off her husband's estate for as long as she wishes.
# If there is a firstborn son, he receives a double portion.
# The daughters are supported off their father's estate until they get married.
if no sons then it gets passed to daughters.

i doubt the rest of the explanations on the website now <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/>
