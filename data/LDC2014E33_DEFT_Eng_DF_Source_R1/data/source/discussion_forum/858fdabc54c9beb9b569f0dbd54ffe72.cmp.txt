If what was paid for by private dollars? Health care? You must be joking if you are going to claim that the free market keeps health insurance costs down. If that were true, we'd not be having this discussion.

Expenses under Medicare are way more transparent and accountable than they are under private health care providers.

The Free Market could keep Health Care down Ravi. Tort Reform, Liability coverage Reform, Cost of Schooling and loan repayment Reform, anything legitimate to bring cost of services down. Unjustified mandates multiply cost. Unnecessary testing increases cost. Clarify, simplify. We need less chaos, not more. What you advocate will overwhelm and multiply cost. It will bankrupt us.

<img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> You aren't talking about the free market...you are talking about rewriting the rules so the insurance companies can do whatever they want without penalty. Which isn't really very far from what it is now. The free market has NOT kept health care costs down.

There are plenty of countries that have some form of public option or single payer health care and none of them are bankrupt or in danger of becoming so.

No I am not talking about rewriting the rules so the insurance companies can do whatever they want without penalty. I'm talking about making the laws understandable and functional.

Obviously, you have no argument.

It has been proven to you over and over that COBRA is a failure. The citizens who are to be assisted by both COBRA and ARRA are not helped by it, yet you continue to claim it is a great program.

You are the dolt, Bfgrn, yes you. You said that the program did not suck because it continued health care for those who are unemployed. Yet, when it is proven that it does not provide health insurance for the poor you fall back on mularky and claim, I want free health insurance without even a basis for such a lie.

Yeah, your are an idiot of the third class. Come up with a real argument as to why you think COBRA is a worthwhile program, if you can.

COBRA is NOT assistance... it is a law that was passed to prevent insurance cartels from canceling people's health insurance when they lose their jobs by allowing them to PAY for their coverage under group rates...WITHOUT Cobra, the premium would be at an individual rate that would make COBRA look like every day is Christmas...

Yet, it fails! It fails because people who lose their jobs, cannot keep the coverage even though the cartel is prevented from cancelling their health insurance. That is why it fails. So, technically, they can lay the blame at the feet of those who lose their jobs.

The insurance cartel: "Don't blame us! You could have continued your coverage under the COBRA laws but you chose not to."

The unemployed worker: "But, I had to pay my mortgage and feed my children."

The cartel: "Tough F'ing shit. We need to pay our CEO." <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

That is why COBRA sucks.
