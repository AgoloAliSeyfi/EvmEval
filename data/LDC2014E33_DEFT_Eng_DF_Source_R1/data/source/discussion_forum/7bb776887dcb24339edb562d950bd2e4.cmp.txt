The day the ability to criticise religion comes is the turning point from Human advancement towards atheism, or atleast secularism, to go backwards.

Why are they so paranoid?

FFS Theo Van Gogh was shot in the street, Salman Rushdie is wanted dead by most Islamic states, he isn't too popular with their populations either, and Aryaan Hirisi Ali, a Somalian Muslim who escaped the Extreme Islamic grip over Somali culture - Genital - Cutting, beating, forcing clothing on them, lots of freedom taken away etc Is hated because she speaks out about the rise of authoritative islam on former christian African Countries.

Why are they so paranoid?

And another thing, why have the progressive's caved in to this. Most people I know love a good poke at 'stupid christians' or how christians are the evil atheism must overcome, well yes, and Christianity has done some awful s***... in the past. What about now? They pretty much have the christian secularist enlightenment of the 18th century to thank for their freedom of spreech and largely oppression-free society. Yet when you say, "well Islam is a bigger threat to civil liberties" its all "OMG ISLAMOPHOBE RACIST RACIST NAZI RACIST OMG BNP!!!!!!" (despite islam not being a race, and Islamophobia entirely being invented by cultural marxists who want to silence any people that don't want to give in to their world view.... equality and freedom of speech eh?) Is there such a thing a christianophobia or sikhphobia??? Plenty of Sikh's have been beaten up because they are immigrants and ignorant tw@s see the turban and think 'terrorrist', yet we don't hear of 'sikhaphobia' or 'racism'? Its a hate crime.

Peace

Most Muslims are not White. And in some parts of Europe being Muslim is equated with ethnicity.

And oh really? Buddhist famillies DO have it, Muslim, Sikh and Hindu's DO have it. Its not unique to Muslims only (and since Muslims ARE the second largest ethno-religious group in Europe its still tiny but honour killings would representive of that to group proportion).

Anyone who tries to say its a "Muslim problem" is know nothing racist because as we all know Muslims are not considered to be White, they are thought of as being brown. And since in Europe we've had racial problems before owed to the majority of us Whites, it s not unreasonable to say Muslims are not the target of old fashioned White racism when the economy goes bad.

Jews are not a race either but that didn't stop the Nazis from killing all of them.

Wow you bigot.

And Jew is considered a race depending on the context, it can denote both a religion and a person of Jewish origin since generally Jews can trace their ancestory to Israel. Just look at a bunch of jewish people they share similar enviromentally influenced genetics.

Clearly you are the racist here, ignoreing the fact thete are lots of white muslims in europe - you claimed to be one yourself- or did you forget?

Out of all the religions honour killings are by far most prevalant in muslims families - the vast majority, this is not coincidence - please provide a link of a buddhist being convicted of this crime in the whole of europe.
This is not a ethnicity issue at all however youd like to make it- there are millions of chinese koreans and japanese ethnicities in europe - how many rpeorted convictions of honour killing have those communities incurred. Compare that to the muslim population. How thick would you have to be to ignore that

What does that even mean ? <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/>

It's things like these that make me wish our human rights record was like China's. Too much freedom makes people abuse that freedom.
