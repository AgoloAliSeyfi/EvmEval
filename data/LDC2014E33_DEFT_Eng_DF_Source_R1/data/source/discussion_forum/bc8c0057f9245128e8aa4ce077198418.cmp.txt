It's amazing the people who push this crap think if you aren't paying taxes to the gov't then no charitable acts wil ever take place.
The truth is that the govt is the least efficient method of distributing anything that might actually help people. But in general gov't programs increase poverty and dependence. Which is probably the idea.

The truth is that charities are the least efficient. On top of exorbitant salaries of some charity CEOs, they have high overhead and are feast or famine depending on contributions

Public charities are a nice stopgap but they are incapable of handling the volume that the government can.

No country on earth relies on public charities to handle all their public welfare

The issue is not which kind of 'charity' is most efficient, government or private. The issue is that government charity creates a class of poor who are never anything but poor, make their beds daily in their own misery, cannot see the opportunities that are out there for them in this great country, and have given up their freedom for a type of miserable security that no one would choose without having it foisted upon them.

What do private charities do to wean people out of poverty?

Government welfare agencies offer educational support and jobs programs to provide a way out of poverty. Millions of Americans have taken advantage of these programs

In frequent threads here the brain-dead leftists moan about how the "idle rich" (like there is such a thing) don't deserve their money. But look at the other side. The poor in this country enjoy a lifestyle envied by even middle class people in most of the world. What have they done to deserve this? The idlest of the idle rich invest money and help other hard working people get ahead. The poor simply absorb tax payer funding and have babies.

Private charities are much more inefficient than government. Most of their overhead is dedicated just to the act of raising money. Some charities spend as much as 90% just in fundraising expenses

What's the overhead for govt? I'll bet it is much higher than the AVERAGE (not some horror story) for charities.

</quote>

Any government program or function has high overhead.

</quote>

Fact is, government overhead is much lower. Government executives make significantly less than the heads of charities. Charities have to spend a great deal of their time and effort on just raising money.....forget about dispersing it. Government does not have that problem

"But lots of people are. And they are the problem, simply because they cause a demand on other people's resources."

And that is also fine and dandy but that gives you no right to slander those who make no such demands.

If you wouldn't demand the taxpayer subsidize your gasoline in every post I might take you seriously.

You've lost it. I've never demanded the tax payer subsidize my gasoline in any post.

Do you have some explaination or do you commonly just spout whatever wild-assed lie pops into your head?

Anyone who is a true follower of christ knows you give personally and from your own heart... not having it raped from you whether you have the calling to give it or not

Hardly... the red tape and crap thru the multi-levels of government waste more money... you find NUMEROUS NUMEROUS charities out there where a vast majority, if not all proceeds going to the cause and not lining pockets

They are actually the most efficient, far more than the gov't, in part because they are there, while the gov't is in Washington.
The more bureaucrats run charities, the mroe people who need them. The more private sources run charities, the less people need them. Moral in there somewhere.

You get to research and choose your charities.... while government adds more and more levels, more and more red tape, at more and more expense, WITHOUT choice
