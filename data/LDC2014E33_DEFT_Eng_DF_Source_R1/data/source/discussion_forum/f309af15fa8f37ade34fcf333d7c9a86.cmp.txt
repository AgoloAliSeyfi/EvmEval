The Earth's climate is now clearly out of balance and is warming. Many components of the climate systemincluding the temperatures of the atmosphere, land and ocean, the extent of sea ice and mountain glaciers, the sea level, the distribution of precipitation, and the length of seasonsare now changing at rates and in patterns that are not natural and are best explained by the increased atmospheric abundances of greenhouse gases and aerosols generated by human activity during the 20th century. Global average surface temperatures increased on average by about 0.6°C over the period 19562006. As of 2006, eleven of the previous twelve years were warmer than any others since 1850. The observed rapid retreat of Arctic sea ice is expected to continue and lead to the disappearance of summertime ice within this century. Evidence from most oceans and all continents except Antarctica shows warming attributable to human activities. Recent changes in many physical and biological systems are linked with this regional climate change. A sustained research effort, involving many AGU members and summarized in the 2007 assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, continues to improve our scientific understanding of the climate.

During recent millennia of relatively stable climate, civilization became established and populations have grown rapidly. In the next 50 years, even the lower limit of impending climate changean additional global mean warming of 1°C above the last decadeis far beyond the range of climate variability experienced during the past thousand years and poses global problems in planning for and adapting to it. Warming greater than 2°C above 19th century levels is projected to be disruptive, reducing global agricultural productivity, causing widespread loss of biodiversity, andif sustained over centuriesmelting much of the Greenland ice sheet with ensuing rise in sea level of several meters. If this 2°C warming is to be avoided, then our net annual emissions of CO2 must be reduced by more than 50 percent within this century. With such projections, there are many sources of scientific uncertainty, but none are known that could make the impact of climate change inconsequential. Given the uncertainty in climate projections, there can be surprises that may cause more dramatic disruptions than anticipated from the most probable model projections.

With climate change, as with ozone depletion, the human footprint on Earth is apparent. The cause of disruptive climate change, unlike ozone depletion, is tied to energy use and runs through modern society. Solutions will necessarily involve all aspects of society. Mitigation strategies and adaptation responses will call for collaborations across science, technology, industry, and government. Members of the AGU, as part of the scientific community, collectively have special responsibilities: to pursue research needed to understand it; to educate the public on the causes, risks, and hazards; and to communicate clearly and objectively with those who can implement policies to shape future climate.

As per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Geophysical_Union"> Wiki:</a>
The American Geophysical Union (or AGU) is a nonprofit organization of geophysicists, consisting of over 50,000 members from over 135 countries. AGU's activities are focused on the organization and dissemination of scientific information in the interdisciplinary and international field of geophysics. The geophysical sciences involve four fundamental areas: atmospheric and ocean sciences; solid-Earth sciences; hydrologic sciences; and space sciences.

The mission of the AGU is

to promote the scientific study of Earth and its environment in space and to disseminate the results to the public,
to promote cooperation among scientific organizations involved in geophysics and related disciplines,
to initiate and participate in geophysical research programs,
to advance the various geophysical disciplines through scientific discussion, publication, and dissemination of information.

Global Climate Change: Background

The Earth's temperature is rising as a result of increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (see Basic Information on Climate Change from EPA). According to NOAA and NASA data, the Earth's average surface temperature has increased by 1.2-1.4º F over the last 100 years. If greenhouse gases continue to increase, climate models predict that the average temperature at the Earth's surface could increase 3.2-7.2º F above 1990 levels by the end of this century.

The major part of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is likely due to an increase in greenhouse gas concentrations resulting from human activity, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report. Human activities across the globeincluding fossil fuel use, land cover conversion (deforestation), and agricultural practicesare contributing to the buildup of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Over the past 1 to 2 centuries, land use and land-use change were responsible for roughly 40 percent of human emissions of carbon dioxide (IPCC Third Assessment Report, Box 3.2).

Within the United States, agriculture accounts for a relatively small share of greenhouse gas emissions, about 7 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2007.
