But you aren't taking capital out of the system and it is capital that creates jobs. This is the same argument the left used against free trade and it was a fallacy then and a fallacy now.

But, if you eliminate the company, you eliminate the capital. Those companies will disappear.

The competition is in the fact that if I (employer generally) don't like the services/costs offered by United Healthcare I can take my business to AETNA. Two years ago my employer had United Healthcare as its provider. Last year, AETNA offered us a better deal with rates and deductibles so we switched to AETNA. This year, United came back with competitive rates and now I am back with United. Next year? Will my employer have such a choice?

Not sure what you mean here. It is always, no matter what industry we are speaking of, the provider that determines the price. It is the purchaser that decides whether or not he/she is willing to pay that price. When I go to the store tomorrow for bread, the price is already set. I can pay that price or I can go down the street and see if the next store has a better price. I can't go into the first store and say, "Your bread is over priced and sliced to thick. I'll give you $0.50 for a loaf." I have to pay the price the store is asking or go without.

So, I'm not sure what you mean here.

True, if that is indeed what HR3200 does. Where does it say that though? Do you have a page number?

</quote>

No page number and I have not read it in a while, but I think... think mind you, can't swear to it, that it was section 102.

Although, Plymco_Pilgrim was keeping a good watch on that bill. Betcha he can tell you exactly how many sentences down from the first page it is. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> Okay, maybe not sentences, but lines?

The question should be why would employers want to deal with this year after year? How did healthcare get so tied up with employment? I would think the employers would welcome the opportunity to be able to get out of healthcare problems and run their companies. It would be a boon to them and they could put more of their money into their business, rather than employee healthcare.

</quote>

Except that they are not being given a way out. In fact, those who have now either chosen or been forced to drop their employee's coverage will be forced to either pick it up again or pay a fine aka tax, for not providing coverage.

I stated earlier that my employer cannot afford it, yet, he continues to insist that his company provides it to the employees. Many companies simply cannot afford it and have been forced out of the market to the detriment of the employees and every year more and more companies or being forced out.

Now, companies are going to be required to cover their employees or be taxed 8% of their payroll? Ouch! Small business is going to get creamed.

You wouldn't need to penalize businesses with a single payer plan. It would work like medicare...a portion of your income goes toward the program. Businesses can't opt out of medicare, if they would they'd be penalized.

And again, if no one has to worry about insurance, all kinds of creative stuff could happen. IMO it would be a boon for anyone with a business plan that was afraid to make a move because they'd be without insurance (as it often happens now).

many insurance companies will convert to the supplemental health insurance business and elective surgery health insurance....

also, most of these insurance companies diversify their investments.

Democrats have been saying that they are all for the elimination of private health insurance. Don't believe me, watch the videos in this thread:

<a href="http://www.usmessageboard.com/healthcare-insurance-govt-healthcare/91753-democrats-admit-that-the-public-option-will-lead-to-single-payer-government-run-care.html">Democrats admit that the Public Option will lead to Single Payer government run care</a>

How many jobs will that costs? I am not just talking about the CEOs and upper management jobs but how many jobs of people like you and me who work hard every day just to put dinner on the table will be lost. From the Janitor to middle management and don't forget the little guys, the independent agents who work for you to get you coverage. Those CEO's employ you; your brothers, sisters, parents, children, friends.

Where are those people going to go when the private health insurer disappears?

How many hundreds of thousands of jobs (Democrat jobs) are going to be lost? What industry do you work in?

Is your job safe?

edit: Oh and let me ask you this, aren't you glad Barney Frank and Barack Obama are working so hard to eliminate those jobs?

Well, a government run plan would have to hire people, too, so it's not clear to me how many jobs net would be lost or gained. What we do know is that if private insurance were replaced by government run insurance similar to Canada's system, massive amounts of capital that insurance companies now invest in our private sector economy would be diverted to buy Treasuries, as Medicare and SS do with their reserve funds, and to pay for the federal government's deficits. I've got to think that withdrawing this much capital from private investment would have a negative effect on economic growth and job creation.

Providing a government option would put Health Care out of business EXACTLY the same way the Post Office put Fed Ex and UPS out of business. It would be EXACTLY the same. No difference at all.
