Thanks Aiden and OmSigDavid

I guess it should be mandatory that the people administering drugs the final cocktails be trained (not necessarily be doctors or anesthesiologists) in the correct use of the drugsâ¦and I am sure that can be worked out somehow.

That part of medicine becomes almost the same as the kind of knowledge that went with hangingâ¦weight, length of rope, length of drop, amount of lubricant on the rope, etc. Surely that part can be handled in a way to insure that the guest of honor at an execution is completely unconscious, because as OmSigDavid pointed out, the guest of honor is not supposed to survive the event! No problem with giving him/her twice as much in order to insure total unconsciousness.

My own experience with the âbeing put outâ thing is: This would not be a bad way to go. I sure as hell do not want to go the way so many people Iâve known and loved over the years have goneâ¦after long, long periods of incredible suffering. How lucky is it for someone destined for a long, protracted period of suffering before deathâ¦to be put under and just not ever wake up.

Lots of good arguments on both sides of this issue.

I still think life in prison is more torture than an easy death on a gurneyâ¦or even tied to a stake at the wrong end of a firing squad.

It may be permanentâ¦and irreversibleâ¦but death is also inevitable. When we execute a criminal, we truly are not taking a lifeâ¦we are just taking some time from a life.

@OmSigDAVID,

That last part about people waking up during surgeryâ¦or being awake and not able to tell anyoneâ¦sent chills down my spine.

What a horrible experience that must be!
