The link between Mind and Social / Environmental-Issues.

The fast-paced, consumerist lifestyle of Industrial Society is causing exponential rise in psychological problems besides destroying the environment. All issues are interlinked. Our Minds cannot be peaceful when attention-spans are down to nanoseconds, microseconds and milliseconds. Our Minds cannot be peaceful if we destroy Nature.

The first rule of sustainability is - destroy less.

The fewer things we make the more sustainable we are.

A society that destroys ecosystems for "consumer goods" in addition to food, clothing, shelter is the least sustainable - and will exist for the shortest duration.

Industrial society has destroyed necessary things [animals, trees, air, water and land] for making unnecessary things [consumer goods].

In "Industrial Society" work turns into overwork, unnecessary work, destructive work.

"Growth Rate" - "Economy Rate" - "GDP"
These are figures of "Ecocide".
These are figures of "crimes against Nature".
These are figures of "destruction of Ecosystems".
These are figures of "Insanity, Abnormality and Criminality".

Infinite growth and development on a small planet that is just 40,000 km in circumference? - Industrial Society is insane.
