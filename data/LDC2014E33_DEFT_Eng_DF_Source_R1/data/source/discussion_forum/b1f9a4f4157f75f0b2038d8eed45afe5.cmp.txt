The Lisbon Treaty is vital for the EU to continue in its being, it holds the fundamentals for accession of croatia, FYROM and any other states wanting to join, the limit of nations is currently met and Lisbon expands that limit to encompass more European nations.
Plus the older treaties, Maastricht etc made it possible to handle the paperwork and legislation of 15 member states, THE EU IS UNDEMOCRATIC because it cannot function without further legislation to handle 27 member states. The LT has the legislatory application to properly handle all member states easier, upto i think 35 states. As for the heavy bureacracy, this has grown quite a abit due to there not being legislation to ease the handling of 27member states, but when the EU was formed over the long period of time since the 40s it was agreed that this was needed to make the EU unaccessible to extremist parties in the EU parliament(its worked so far).
Most people complaining about the EU are brits like me, and we dont fully benefit from the EU because we have/ conservative and labour governments who pay the membership fee but dont reap the benefits, like the Schengen Zone, the Euro all the good stuff, we dont benefit from the removal of borders because we never had immediate wars over borders because of the english channel but imagine how it must feel to be a belgian or a german or a frank, to think you never be invaded by another european again. Social Charters etc and lots more, but our govts have chosen to opt-out of those goodies to please the Right. As for money being distributed into bottomless pits...Well unless im blind, has not the EU built and started upgrading the MOST ADVANCED research facility in Europe on British soil? How many Schools have been built with European Funds, a lot more than you think, mine, our rival, the one north of the river and thats just peterborough. The money goes into fundamental science, the European Space Programme, helping new member states with their economies (polish economy is booming now, and look, the immigrants are starting to go home, all because of EU money to boost their economy and free trade etc.
Without the EU we would struggle financially due to tariffs etc with our euro neighbours. And all this cant work without the Lisbon treaty or a similar restructuring of the Union or legislation...

Still not many people on here have actually read the Treaty cover to cover..(i have) and it doesnt resemble the constitution at all, it made hard reading thats for sure..

As far as i can see Europes doing a great job protecting peace which is what is developed for.
Oh and about the leaders, We do elect them. Through MEP elections, as for electing the President that was in the constitution but that got sacked. The commision has representatives from every country and Barroso himself doesnt hold much power anyway but i do think there should be a more democratic system in place for that, but if it was democratised then we'd pick the person with the cute face with no experience so its fine the way it is.

You're totally missing the point. If the EU is democratic, then the only measure of its political legitimacy or effectiveness is what the people think. Thus, a statement indicating that Ireland voted the wrong way is a contradiction. Either you accept that the EU is totally undemocratic and can push its will on Ireland coercively, or you concede to Ireland's original verdict.

I hope the Irish once again stand up the EU, the only country to be given a say on the treaty, and vote NO again!

Lol actually the rule about referendums isn't that you can only ever hold one and after that the decision made is final <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/p.gif" alt=":p:"/>
It's kinda assumed that another one will come along. In Ireland, where they hold referendums on internal legislation, it is not uncommon for them to ask the same question repeatedly, perhaps in different forms, until the government get the result they want. But they don't force you to agree so what's the problem?

Lastly, if the Irish had agreed, of course there wouldn't be another referendum. They would have already agreed to it!

As an example, say you wanted your dad to take you to, for instance, Mount Splashmore. The best way to do such a thing if you know he won't agree is to either pester him until he agrees or change his mind through reasoning. It isn't uncommon for policy changes to be made to a failed referendum, but by the same token sometimes asking the same question again gets a different answer.
