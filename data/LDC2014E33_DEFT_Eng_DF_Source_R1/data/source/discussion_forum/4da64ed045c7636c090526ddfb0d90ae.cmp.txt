Whatever.

Enjoy your shoes. Work it out.

I don't have 250 to spend on shoes - like soz, before she bought new shoes, I'm working on an old pair of nike air max, best for my own odd feet.

Like the rest of you, I don't care what you or I choose, but that the shoes work with our feet.

Oh, and why, Chai, should ragman try your shoe find, to give an opinion?

You who have never run?

What's the deal for mocking ragman and his opinions?

So, I've offended, you only wanted to hear about the opinions of those who'd tried certain shoes.

Waves bye.

Or is it? I don't get all the heels on the Sartorialist.com - plums balancing, oh, never mind.

Hey, just kidding. I'm an Aerosoles and Naturalist kinda girl... oh, and Hush Puppies. Anything that makes my feet feel like they're in heaven...

Peace be with you and your shoe choice. This all has gotten too embattled for my blood. The fact is that you seems very defensive about all this. Well...You win!

Hey, Mame. Did you know that there's a great website called Zappo's? I've bought a few pair of shoes from them over these last 2 years. They are like the LL Bean (reputable mail-order) of shoes. They carry everything from recreational, casual dress, sneakers to dress shoes for men and women and kids. They guarantee the fit and they'll pay shipping both ways (if you return them). Maybe they have Feng Shwei shoes too?

Let's say we can agree on the matter of foot comfort.

Of course we know about Zappos...

Chai, People who posted on this thread only wanted to provide some information that may be helpful to you, even though none of us has any experience with the shoes you asked about.

I personally think Ragman's suggestion has a lot of merit, and worth your consideration.

Ha! I just bought a pair! I love them!

My worst (foot) crime: I used to wear heels when I worked in offices and one time I saw a podiatrist about all the lumps and bumps on my toes. Did he give me shite!!! I've never worn a heel to work since (occasionally to an evening event, but now I don't even want to go near them)... all the lumps and bumps are gone and I have a new appreciation for my feet and what kind of stress they take all day long.

Have you heard of Fluevog? Now he makes shoes for your foot! And they're ergonomic etc etc etc...

Is... is it safe now?...can I come out?

I'm putting on all my shoes at once and seeing if I can still balance...

ahhhuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuum!

BTW, I have been using a pair of Asics DuoMax's. Best shoe I've had in years. My knees don't bother me with them and my back is no worse than it was.
