If you're stupid enough to go out and buy a car...pay on it for 4 years....and then pick up your 2010 car from the dealership in 2014, then continue paying for it another 6 years, go right ahead....it acutely describes your utter stupidity....furthermore it clearly demonstrates WHAT A FUCKING SCAM THIS WHOLE GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTHCARE SCHEME IS!!!!. If your too ignorant to see that the whole CBO argument is BULLSHIT because of the pay for 10 years and get 6 years of benefit dupe that the CON MAN President is pulling on you then you are even too stupid to post messages here any further...now there....that's a post you can neg rep me for beowolfe.

Patek, that's only part of it. The deception does not end there.
The bill also assumes savings by cutting Medicare. Every time they have cut Medicare the Congress has voted to restore funding. Why is this going to be different?
But the CBO scoring also is good for just the first decade, when as you say payments precede benefits. After that they admit they can't score the thing.
and there is other stuff in there too that came out at the "bipartisan" meeting.

I just find it unconscientable that the Democrats are bound and determined to commit political suicide with this flawed bill just to say "we won, you lost." This is what it is all about. They could care less what happens to the country or the future generations of Americans...as long as they win.

Welcome to a bullshit high school popularity contest.

The immaturity of you Dem's is pathetic.

I think it's largely being driven by Obama and his advisors. They desperately want this to prove they can get legislation passed. They have been spanked on everything else for the last 9 months. They are so desperate they will tkae a Pyrrhic victory. Good policy is the last thing on their minds.

Since you all argue that no one read the bill, why would you believe what ANYONE says about the bill. For those of you who are interested, read the CBO analysis for yourself.

Yes, the wonderful CBO, that takes all the rules and numbers given to it and renders possible results. The CBO or its equivalent has been wrong on every social program's cost. With even the slightest bit of honesty you could at least admit this plan doesn't reduce health care costs. Most of the leadership has already noted the RATE of increase is suppose to decrease. I guess that makes it affordable now and less affordable later huh?
