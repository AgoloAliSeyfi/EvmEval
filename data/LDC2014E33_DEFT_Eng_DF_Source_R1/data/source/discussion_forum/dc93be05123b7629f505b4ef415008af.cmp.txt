Where is the evidence how many were saved by leaflets? You're also glossing over the fact we targeted and killed countless civilians out of pure evil.

How sad, the Japanese died, I did not read all the posts in this thread so maybe the next fact has been covered, if so forgive me.

How about the hundreds of thousands of lives the USA saved in Nagasaki by dropping leaflets warning the japanese that we were going to drop a bomb on Nagasaki, hundreds of thousands fled and lived

War is not ethical or moral. I dont think killing is ethical or moral for any reason ever. We had to fight the war period, it was not our choice, the war forced us to do unethical, immoral acts.

Is it justifiable to act unethically, yes.

Is it justifiable to be immoral, yes.

We did not start the WW II, we were forced to defend ourselves, unfortunately the lesser of two evils is to kill the enemy before the enemy kills your children.

Do you watch a man rape and kill a child or do you do the unethical immoral act of killing the man, justice demands man break the moral codes of society.

Why did the top 3 military commanders say the bombs weren't necessary? Are you joking?

Stop dodging you raggedy cunt and explain why you claim to know better than those three commanders.
