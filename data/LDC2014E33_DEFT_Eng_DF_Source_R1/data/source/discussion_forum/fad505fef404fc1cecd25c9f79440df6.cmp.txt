How many nukes do we have?
Do we really need them all?

How many times over do we need to destroy the earth as habitable for humans

I've been hearing that since the 60s. Same ole, same ole. When we're no longer the biggest kid on the block you will get the answer to your questions. Besides, this country has become too chicken shit to use nukes ever again anyway.

We are rapidly losing the global economic war.

Actually global economics and enhanced communications have made for a smaller interlinked world. Which makes for less of a nuke threat.
We would not want to nuke our factories in China now would we?

Of course we will Always have some rogue elements in all societies that could obtain and use nukes. The more that are laying around the greater the chance of that.

Oh come on peachy thinks we've hidden nuclear bombs underneath her trailer park...all 14 of those ICBMs.

But....she didn't answer your question.

You did not answer my question.

There is no answer; that problem REMAINS. Some of the material (as nuclear components are termed) is buried. Deep underground in areas where there are few earthquakes, or in lots of concrete.
***********************************************
In the United States alone, the Department of Energy states there are "millions of gallons of radioactive waste" as well as "thousands of tons of spent nuclear fuel and material" and also "huge quantities of contaminated soil and water."[13] Despite copious quantities of waste, the DOE has stated a goal of cleaning all presently contaminated sites successfully by 2025.[13] The Fernald, Ohio site for example had "31 million pounds of uranium product", "2.5 billion pounds of waste", "2.75 million cubic yards of contaminated soil and debris", and a "223 acre portion of the underlying Great Miami Aquifer had uranium levels above drinking standards."[13] The United States has at least 108 sites designated as areas that are contaminated and unusable, sometimes many thousands of acres.[13][14] DOE wishes to clean or mitigate many or all by 2025, however the task can be difficult and it acknowledges that some may never be completely remediated. In just one of these 108 larger designations, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, there were for example at least "167 known contaminant release sites" in one of the three subdivisions of the 37,000-acre (150 km2) site.[13] Some of the U.S. sites were smaller in nature, however, cleanup issues were simpler to address, and DOE has successfully completed cleanup, or at least closure, of several sites.[13]

Some of this is from old nukes.

Nuclear plants and nuclear medical waste, not weapons.

But....we only have "14" ICBMs according to you, so that is close to my example of 10. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_pray.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Now....the trick question is how many "nukes" are on each ICBM.....

"Used nuclear arsenal?"

We want to have reserves if a war breaks out or enough to make other side think twice about pulling a fast one on us.

If they have 10 bombs and you lower your numbers to 2 bombs, they might get the crazy idea of taking out your 2 bombs with say 5-6 of their bombs...then they own you. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_whistle.gif"/>

We have thousands of active nuclear weapons, not "10".

True, our problem was getting ours to "THEM" before theirs got to the US. SLBM's and cruise missiles helped even out the geographical disadvantage.

Yeah, we should get rid of nukes and not threaten China with them because they have our debt. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

Instead we should just surrender to them...right?
