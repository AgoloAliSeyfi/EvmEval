You ARE a child... someone forgot to check your ID.

The article is a summary of the actual report... and yes, I can translate Japanese easily, it's called Google translator. Try it sometime... but then you'd have to face even more real facts.

So you've read the actual report?

It supports everything we have already told you... all the facts you ignored. Instead of wasting your time neg repping people just because you were made to look the fool you really should go look at all the facts.

Here's the thing, my theory, you are either some little brat so pissed off at the world you don't care about learning anything real but need something to blame on the adults of the world (since you don't know the use of maroon as an insult it's very likely)... or you are a Gore heir and just want to make certain to get more than you deserve when he dies.

Was that a yes or a no? Here, I'll try again.

There are no such things as yes or no questions, all questions must be fully analyzed, unlike your logic we who know Global Warming is a hoax use our brains for more than inflating our heads, we think and actually look at all the facts before making wild claims.

Whether to read a report or not, perhaps you should take a gander at it and see what it says yourself. Go on, find it and translate it for yourself. Your eyes won't bleed from the truth honestly.
