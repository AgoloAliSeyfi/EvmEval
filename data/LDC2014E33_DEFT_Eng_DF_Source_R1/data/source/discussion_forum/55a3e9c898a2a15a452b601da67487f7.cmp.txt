@BrightNoon,

I am not entirely without hope. Some small shift beyond the oil economy is already occurring. Don't forget the human species is capable of rapid adaptation.
And especially countries like the US have shown they can adapt real quickly if they have too. We saw evidence of that adaptability in the days of the new deal and again in the rapid transition from peacetime to wartime economy in the years 1917-1918 and 1941-1945. While some of the worlds wealth may be redistributed to other parts of the world the US is still the leading technology driver. That power can also drive a rapid change away from oil.

@BrightNoon,

We can safely assume that the amount of petroleum is finite even though we can assume also that new discoveries of addition sources and improved extraction methods may extend the life of oil-based technologies, and that our needs will eventually absorb the resource.
We cannot precisely predict when the crises will occur, but we understand its inevitability. This crisis will be a global problem and will be resolved globally. We can, however, begin at once to reduce our usage of oil and oil products, invest in the development of alternative sources of energy and move ever more towards their use, and fund both technological and scientific innovations.

@jgweed,

It seems like we're all pretty much in agreement; the current global order cannot be survive, unless there are extremely rapid deployments of renewable energy technologies. If we will be presented with a choice between collectivization on a global scale or death, I must admit, I choose death: i.e. mad max style chaos. In any case, I wanted to bring up an analogy, often misused, but that I think is relavant here.

There widely differing opinions about the causes of the collapse of the Roman Empire, but the general consensus is that the Roman military system became unsustainable and was replaced with a mercenary system because an economic collapse, beginning around the reign of Septimius Severus. Now, here is the part relevant to all of us. This economic collapse was basically the result of the unfortnuate Roman habit of importing huge quantities of very expensive, luxery goods from Asia, which were paid for in hard currency. The Mediterranean's old mines were unable to keep up with the losses, resulting in a profound debasement of the currency and in masive inflation. Quite a few of the Emperor's in the later period tried and failed to enforce strict price controls in response. The basic problem, with differences is detail, was the same as that faced by the United States today; we have a masive and growing trade deficit, resulting from our import of cheap manufactures and oil. We don't have hard currency, so this money can be replaced physcially, but we are similiarly being hollowed out, because of the government policy of constantly encouraging spending, much of which leaves the country via those imports.

Anyhow, I couldn't reists bringing this up, cliche as it is.

@BrightNoon,

There's more to it I am afraid. If we can fix the peak oil problem technology and its survival-of-the-fittest driven abuse will simply lead us to the next crisis.
A worldwide change of attitude is what we really need to survive as humanity.
