About 80% of them have already.
For instance if we made cars without robots it would take 10X the manpower to produce what we now produce.

Actually, it's people who build the robots since not enough are being made to create an assembly line. It's people who make the precision parts the robots are made from. People who design the robots. People who are the technicians to maintain the robots. People who install and program the robots. People who design the parts the robots make.

All that takes "education". Something Republicans "mock". Odd that.

yes. anything that can be done without critical thinking can be programmed into a robot to do. since building a robot from peices doesn't require critical thinking, one day robots will build robots and then humans will only be needed for trouble shooting, designing, and programming them. I think those who have rejected science will finally realize their fautls at this point since there will be little jobs available for them. even more advanced jobs could be taken over by robots if AI continues to improve, and of course if robots become capable of learning on their own then humans are no longerneeded at all.

computers can only be as smart as whomever is programming them.
But they are extremely accurate and consistant. Much better than humans for many jobs actually.

And of all that only the maintenance and perhaps the engineering is generally US provided.

As far as the workers maintaining and manufacturing the robots. A tech education is a must, but almost equally as important is experience. I did that type of work for a few years.

It's the manufacturing too. I have a friend who runs a machine shop. Their biggest money maker, railroad ties, was moved to Mexico. So they revamped their business to make high quality machined parts.

These are parts used in everything from the "medical industry" to "specialized tiny mechanisms". Stuff that are made in the hundreds or few thousand at the most. They even make stuff for the military or NASA.

COOL! Sounds like they got a pretty good thing going with a blend of customers.

yes everything is being pushed to robots. as usual the usa military is leading the technological push, currently to militarize the entire armed forces, but with everything else all this R&amp;D trickles down to the private sector. if people think drones and killer military bees are bad wait until the entire army is robotic which will happen in most's peoples lifetime who are reading this.

I'm sorry, I can't tell if you're joking or not.

Robots only become feasible if they are doing something that makes many thousands or millions. Like cars.

If it's only a few hundred, then the time it takes to program the robot and verify it's doing the task correctly, you could have the job already finished. So robots are limited.

And all to few understand, therefore nothing will be done to avoid the slide.
If it is not already too late to avoid most all of it regardless of what we do?

Are we as a nation blinded by our arrogance?
