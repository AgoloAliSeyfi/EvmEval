Found this blog earlier which talks about the need to slow population growth. The blogger puts forward a two child policy as the answer.

Any thoughts?

I've considered this, and realised the solution is actually quite simple. Remarkably so, in fact:

We ask Santa for a reformation of humanity. He gave me a Wii last year, and they were waaaaaaaaay harder to come across.

The only countries that would be able to implement this already have birth rates below replacement (or will do soon) The only area of real population growth in the future is going to be Africa, and I can't imagine any African states being able to exert this level of control and organisation on their citizens.

Limiting the number of children people can have is an infringement of their rights. If you discouraged people from having children by increasing taxes on families with more children then that would be a much more humane way of controlling population.
Despite this, I still think that technology will always develop to incorporate a larger world population. There are still huge stretches of land untouched by humans on earth - Scotland isn't crowded in the slightest. When the earth runs out I firmly believe we will just colonise elsewhere.

Plus, there are too many old people. We need births!

We'll reach a point betweee 8 and 11 billion (apparently) where population will stabilize. Hardly a 'crisis'

In theory, as i concur with the Boserups view on it, we should be able to feed etc this population. As "The power of ingenuity would always outmatch that of demand"

People only talking about population rises in terms of the present. 'oh my god we can't feed 8 billion people etc' (which we can). But fail to realize the technological advances that will happen. Just look at the past 30 years.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_fertility_rate">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of...fertility_rate</a> - Pretty much all the top 40 (probably a bit liberal, I'd extend it to the top 100) countries haven't got the ablity to implement such a policy.

Don't worry the higher class people are slowly killing the poor people of the world using cheap food filled with addictive chemicals that are harmful to the human body. These foods include mcdonalds and all its other fast food cousins. The higher class themselves can afford to consume food that is free of these chemicals meaning O_R_G_A_N_I_C food. In poor countries they have unleashed the deadly disease called AIDs to kill all the people so that they can have all the resources of the world. MU WA HHAA HA HA HA HA.

No, better bio and agricultural science techniques are the answer. Not reproductive oppression.
