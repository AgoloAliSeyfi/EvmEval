This morning I was watching "Good Day New York" on Channel 5, which is part of the FOX network. The co-host were interviewing a guy who is part of the on-going occupation of Wall St., and were (of course) repeating the media standard line by questioning the man as to why there is no set goals or leadership to advocate such goals. During his response, the man pointed out that it's about all types of people pointing out that nothing is being done about the economic inequality and subsequent crimes perpetrated by Wall St./banking giants (individuals and corporations)....and that you had leaders from various backgrounds join in. He stated that Al Sharpton "a self made man from the streets like me" was joining.....at which time co-host Greg Kelly interjected (twice) that like Al Sharpton, Rupert Murdoch is a self made man.

<img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/confused.gif"/> Come again?

Rupert Murdoch INHERITED HIS FATHER'S OWNERSHIP OF TWO NEWSPAPERS IN THE U.K. (Australia). He did NOT start out in the copy room of some local city paper and work his way up to mogul.

Al Sharpton grew up doing the preacher circuit for his particular brand of religion. Big difference.

I saw this as just another Fox flunkie pushing the "class warfare" line that's heard from the neocon/teabagger pundits in the media. By trying to equate Murdoch as a successful "every man", co-host Greg Kelly pushes the subliminal context that the Wall St. protesters are just "jealous" of "successful people".

Typical Fox BS....but not unexpected.

Hate to point out the obvious (I lie) but when Murdoch inherited those tow papers in Australia he had been working as an editor for a different paper in another country. He then built those tow papers into a media empire that makes idiots like you froth at the mouth. If that is not a self made man I have never heard of one.

Hate to point out your painfully obvious regurgitation of a false premise (I lie), but his editorial work for a London tabloid DID NOT lead up the ladder of hard work to being head of one of Australia's leading news paper The Sunday Mail.....he INHERITED that when his father died.

Murdoch, the son of Sir Keith Murdoch (1886Â–1952), a famous Australian war correspondent and publisher, studied at Worcester College, Oxford (M.A., 1953), and briefly worked as an editor on Lord Beaverbrook's London Daily Express, where he first gained practical experience in the sensationalist journalism that would be a major influence early in his career as a publisher. His father having died, he returned to Australia in 1954 to take over his inheritance, the Sunday Mail and The News, both of Adelaide

No one is denying Murdoch's personal success....but to keep trying to push this BS that he's a "self made man" is just that...BS. Only a complete idiot would believe that an editor of a tabloid becomes the overnight owner of TWO major newspapers based solely on his merit and salary. But then again, in the desperate attempt to defend the neocon/teabagger status quo and legends, a Quantum Windbag will blow any smoke necessary. Carrry on.

Where did I say it did?

What I said was that he was working for someone else when his father died. He inherited two papers in Adelaide, the capital of South Australia (which is a state). He then built those two papers into a major media empire by making them profitable and expanding his holdings to other papers in Australia, and then the UK. It was what he did after he inherited them that make him a self made man, not the fact that he inherited them. If he had been like you those papers would have been dead by now and no one would have heard of Murdoch.
