Yup the "rich" get richer. The solution is not to make the rich poorer, but to make more people rich. Government can't do that. Only getting an education, having a good idea and working your ass off can make you rich.
Conservatives don't hate poor people. We hate that there are poor people.
Paying people to stay poor only makes more poor people and less rich ones.

Your vision will likely not change things. Many people think poverty is a virtue.

It may or may not be, but expecting someone else to work to support you doesn't seem particularly virtuous to me.

What Is "Greed"?

It's stockholders.... " drafting " CEO's to spend more time, in D.C., to get a STRONGER choke - hold....

..... <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-03-16/wanted-more-ceos-in-washington">on politicians</a> !!!!!!

"A new study by FTI Consulting concludes that institutional investors no longer accept the fact that chief executives may get involved in policy debates. They demand it. In fact, more than 85 percent of the investors surveyed said they want CEOs to engage more with policy makers to protect their company ’ s interests. With 95 percent of those surveyed also complaining that the decisions coming out of Washington have been negative for their portfolios, it’s easy to see why. And when the survey pool consists of 260 investors managing assets of $2.6 trillion, executives may want to heed that advice."

What Is "Greed"?

My current definition is hedge funds and energy speculators manipuating the oil markets when they have zero business being there in the 1st place. They add no value and are destructive to the extreme of causing food riots in 3rd world countries. Lech's are they all.

The OWS movement rails about "greed", like we can outlaw an emotion.
But what is greed? Is someone who works hard because he wants to get ahead greedy? I don't think anyone would say so.
It seems greed is wanting money that legitimately doesn't belong to you. I can be as greedy as I want, but unless someone gives me money voluntarily then it doesn't do much. If I deceive someone, then I am a criminal. But if I deliver on what I've promised then I've earned my money.
By that definition the OWS crowd are the greedy ones. They demand their student loans get paid off, yet they've done nothing to deserve that. They demand--well, I dont know what they want. Neither do they. But demanding someone else's money is greed.

According to the liberal lexicon, "greed" is the condition of anyone who's got what you want and can't get.

The answer then, is to become rich! Anyone can do it. If a couple of kids fidding in the garage can create Microsoft or Apple, it can be done.

Not by the lazy, but it can be done.

The battle cry of the left is GIMMMEEEEE.

Why is Bill Gates calling for higher taxes on the 1%?

</quote>

Gates already made his money. Raising taxes on high incomes won't hurt him that much. Income taxes prevent people from becoming rich, not from being rich.

Greed is defined by Bill Gates and Khazarian bankers hijacking our financial system, and gangster politicians like the Chicago Mob's Barack Obama hijacking America
