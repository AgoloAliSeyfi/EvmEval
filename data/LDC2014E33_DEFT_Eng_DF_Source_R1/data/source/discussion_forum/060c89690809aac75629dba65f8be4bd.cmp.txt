Well, if you don't like it Noah, why don't you just go back to Africa! <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"/> How's that for racism? Oh wait....that was Halle Selassie's idea....

The 'other option' you might be seeking would be actually making an effort to understand others, and refuse to accept that one person is inferior to another, despite what you see. You use empirical observation to judge the world at large in 'believing' in 'white supremacy'. This isn't the case. Just by your thesis, you have already implied that you judge yourself as inferior, if you are indeed Black, thus perpetuating not only self-hatred, but hatred of whites.

One of the things in this hare-brained rant that really gripes me, as those who know me will immediately understand, is the perversion of history. The subject is far, far more complex and detailed than the simplistic burro-shit offered here. "White people" did not at any time set out to militarily and economically dominate and repress "people of color." Nascent nationalism lead the Portuguese, the Dutch, the Spanish, the English, the French and the Germans to colonize other parts of the world (in roughly that order) for reasons of economic opportunity in the beginning, and for reasons of national prestige at the height of the 19th century colonization frenzy. The slave trade in Africa began long, long before Europeans ever bought a single slave on the Guinea coast. It was promoted by Muslims, and Muslim Africans made a good living from waging war on their less sophisticated tribal brothers in order to capture people for sale. The Dutch were the first Europeans to go into the slave trade in a big way, because of a market in what is now Brazil, and later a market in the West Indies. In 1609, a Dutch captain made port in Jamestown, and sold African slaves to the English there in order to buy provisions for his ship. It is certainly true that a perversion of Christianity was necessary to make the upright, "good Christian" reconciled to keeping slaves. That is a far cry from the implicit suggestion that a concept of white supremacy is endemic in European cultures. In a rather long post on another thread, I ran down the reasons for the acquisition of most of the territories which eventually constituted the British Empire. In none of the European colonial empires was any racial concept the motivating factor for the marshaling of national resources to imperial ends. For the Dutch, their more than eighty year war of independence made successful, lucrative overseas trade a necessity of survival. For the English, their paranoia about a dominant continental power made them obsessive about maintaining overseas trade, and a large, effective Navy which could protect that trade. The Portugese had simply traded down the African coast, around the Cape of Good hope, and up the east coast of Africa to the Persian Gulf. Eventually, they found their way as far east as China. Profit was their motive, much as it was for individuals in Holland and England, who were able to interest their respective governments in the benefits of promoting trade. For the French and the Germans, colonial empires were efforts in nationalistic pride.

There are a great many very fertile grounds for speculative research on why the Europeans started largely in last place 1500 years ago, and ran to the head of the human pack in technological development in the last millennium. For whatever one may contend the reasons are, a belief in white supremacy is an obviously spurious candidate. The mercantile classes who encouraged their governments (largely the Dutch and English-the Portugese never really sought empire, and the Spanish were terrible at the exercise) to promote their overseas capitalistic ventures were motivated by reasons of personal gain-if one wished to call it greed or venality, so be it. To call it in effect institutional racism, is to put the historical cart before the horse. Theories of white supremacy have been cooked up after the fact of slavery and African conquest. "The White Man's Burden" is a nineteenth century concept, and was no part of the thinking of Prince John the Navigator, Ferdinand and Isabella, the Dutch Estates or the Parliament.

If you want to peddle this hogwash to the public, you should choose a place where the readers are sufficiently ignorant of history to buy your claptrap. It won't work here.

All of that being said, i would just like to comment that many of my best friends are human beans, although i'm not so sure i'd want my daughter to marry one.

Again more filibustering arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! If the problems of a people that result in lagging outcome relative to other peoples are NOT rooted in EXTERNAL phenomenon, then WHAT is the other option? If the social and economic gaps between blacks and whites in this nation and world are not due to external factors such as slavery, colonization, Jim Crow, exploitation, degradation for centuries that what is the root of these gaps? Furthermore, it is a law of nature that every action creates a reaction and that the present is created from the past. Thus, what has been the reaction upon blacks from years of subjugation; exploitation and manipulation at the hands of white society and what impact has the past 400 years inherit upon the present?

Also, it is not about INTENT...it is about Effect. Who cares what the INTENT of the European explorers were...this is about the EFFECT.
