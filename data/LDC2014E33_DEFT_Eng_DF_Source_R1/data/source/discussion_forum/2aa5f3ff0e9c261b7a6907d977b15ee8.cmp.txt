How can you ask me about the national debt growing 6 trillion per year when it grew 6 trillion during Bush's 8 years?

Seriously, try to focus.

It grew by that amount because the non-operating debts outside of the budgetary process rose. I explained how that occurs here.

It is for the same reason why the debt rose under Clinton, even though Slick Willie ran operating budget surpluses.

Could and should not this "debts outside the budgetary process) costs have been predicted reasonably close and budgeted for? I mean it is a real cost/debt right?

That is how I do my budget....

There is a difference between the operating budget and the liabilities of the national government. I'm not sure how they recognize the accruals of future liabilities of the trust. I hate quoting myself, but I don't want to re-type this analogy of how the government creates its own liabilities.

Think of it this way.

Let's say you are 40 years old and you promise to put your 70 year old mother in a nursing home when she is 80, or 10 years from now. Poof! You have created a liability for yourself - the amount that you will have to pay in the future for your mother's nursing home in 10 years. Let's say the going rate for a nice home is $2000 a month and you expect her to live to be 90. Your liability is $240,000 for your mother's future nursing home. Now, you haven't actually borrowed anything but your liability has risen. You have essentially created a debt that you owe in the future. To remind yourself, you write an IOU to yourself to pay for it some time down the road. Now, if you made $50,000 a year and spent $40,000 a year, then you've saved $10,000. But your liabilities (debt) has gone up because you've made this promise. That is how you can be in surplus and have your debt rise. This is essentially what happened under Clinton and in his final budgets.

I believe that this graph is disingenuous, at least as it pertains to the Bush and Obama administrations.

The United States has a fiscal year that starts in October and ends in September, and the annotation for fiscal years is for the following year. For example, for the year 2009 in this graph, that is not for the calendar year 2009. It is for the fiscal year 2009. And the fiscal year 2009 began in October 2008 and ended in September 2009. In other words, it is the last budget passed by Bush.

As for the stimulus, a relatively small proportion of the stimulus was spent during the fiscal year 2009, ~10%-20%. Thus, only a small proportion of the deficit is attributable to the stimulus.

The reason why the deficit is so high is partly because of the Bush tax cuts - had Bush not cut taxes, the government would have received more revenue. But it is mainly because of the automatic fiscal stabilizers built into the budget. In other words, even if Bush had cut taxes, the deficit would still have been very high.

Indeed, the first year Obama was responsible for, by that graph would be 2010.
