Yep all income should be taxed exactly the same no matter how you got it.

</quote>

Even if it's already been taxed once? Tell me, do you pay taxes at the grocery store on the food you buy and then pay taxes again when you eat it?

How many bites of the apple does the gubmint get?

</quote>

you do pay income tax on your paycheck and the sales tax on consumable goods? what isnt that double taxation? damn did i just through a wrench in your argument about the same money being taxed twice?

and food is actually not taxable.

</quote>

Your right, we are being double and sometimes triple dipped. You actually want it to continue and get quadruple and quintuple dipped? How about our pay checks just go to the gubmint and they give everyone an equal share to meet their needs? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

By the way, if food isn't taxable.......why do I pay taxes on it at the grocery store? Depends where you live. Medicine is also taxable here. Gubmint needs their cut of my pie after all.

No you're not right, you say every time money changes hands it gets taxed, but you fail to recognize that money earned and that has been taxed will be taxed a second time upon death per the estate tax. Your comparing money that has been earned, taxed, spent thus being earned by another party, taxed and spent again etc etc... not the same as the estate tax at all.

You fail!

And THAT is the debate being had. The 35% on amounts over $5M is the compromise, and frankly, it's a compromise that's slanted incredibly far to the right. But it just ain't good enough is it? No no, we need *NO* estate tax at all.

Tough shit. We live in a society where everyone gets a voice, and this is the current policy. Chances are it will move more to the middle over time.

And stop worrying about it... Nobody believes you're worth $5M so give it up, man!

You know, you're right. Everyone in our society gets a voice. What they shouldn't get, is access to my checkbook by government force. Fuck them! Go earn your own damn living.

I agree, we need NO estate tax at all.

BTW I don't care what you or anyone else believes.

If what Barney Frank says is true, that what you inherit isn't worked for thus should be taxed at 55%, what does that say about what the government gets in taxes from us?

The government didn't work for it. Why do they feel they have a right to all of that money? This assumes that what we didn't actually work for automatically belongs to the government.

This is why Barney Frank's argument is wrong. You shouldn't be taxed higher just because, in his opinion, you didn't work for it. As long as it's legal it doesn't matter how you got it. What right does he have to decide the level of taxation according to how it was obtained?

Watch the video:

The number one goal of Marxism is the removal of private property. The ownership of all property by the government.

I think we're seeing this in Barney Frank.
