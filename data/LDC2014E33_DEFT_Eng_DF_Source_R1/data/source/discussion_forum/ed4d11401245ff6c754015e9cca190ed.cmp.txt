2. Rudd has said he would retire if he lost.

Now is not the time to be bickering with an election coming.

3. Looks like he just ended his career, then.

Wonder why Rudd tried this? Did he actually think that he'd get Gillard to resign simply by publicly challenging her? Or was he promised support that didn't actually materialize?

Whatever it was, Rudd ended up getting played big time here. Is there a way to say that in Australian?
