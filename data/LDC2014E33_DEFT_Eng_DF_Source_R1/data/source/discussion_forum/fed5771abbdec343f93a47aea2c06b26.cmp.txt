first off, a) you know this how? how many have inheritable/inherited wealth they had no hand in helping create or maintain? I'll wait while you get back to me with those figures....

b) who do you think you are? so you don't think someone deserves? Oh thank you commissar...deserves?? really? Okay....I don't think you deserve internet access 24 a day. hows that? what did you do to make that happen? c) your envy, no jealousy, is noted.

well internet access is a pay service so you can try to limit my usage, but it wont work.
now if an heir to a business actually works at the business, then it can be passed on to them without much tax consequence. all you need to do is hire a lawyer and go through the proper channels and paperwork.
but many heirs did not actually do anything to deserve the $ other than being born. lets look at the Hilton sisters. no jobs at the hotel, no college education, nothing but being born a hilton. do they deserve have the family business? what about actors children? or politicans children? or musicians children? they obviously had no hand in creating the family wealth, yet the benefit for the simple reason of being born into that family.

i dont have any dog in the fight. especially since any estates i stand to inherit will fall well below the estate tax threshold. plus my family has basically said they are gonna spend everything "they" earned before they die. which i said more power to them. i didnt feel entitled to their money because im their child. its their money, i didnt do anything to help them earn it.

But what if it were above the threshold and they want to give it to you? Why would you feel the government is entitled to a portion of what your parents earned and paid taxes on?

if it were above the threshold, i would be intelligent enough to retain a lawyer and explore the most economical ways to have the estate passed on. there are many legal avenues to limit the estate tax. and since they are not taxing my parents, and this is new money to me, then it has the right to be taxed. im not championing the idea that i like taxes, but with it being new income to my person, it should be subject to taxes.

'Heirs DidnÂ’t Do Anything to Deserve Inheritance'....jackass....this guy needed to go, so bad.

</quote>

what exactly did heirs do to earn this $ other than being born into that family? this isnt a monarchy and never has been. heirs didnt work a day in their life to earn anything, so why should they be able to get everything for free?

and the constitution gives the government to right to collect taxes... or did you forget about that little clause... if you did its article 1, section 8 as well as the 16th amendment.

Were you dropped on your head as a baby? No, seriously, were you? My father-in-law gave my son his father's (f-i-l's dad and my sons great grandfather) shotgun. It was a family posession handed down from generation to generation. Should my son have been taxed by the government for this family gift? It doesn't matter if it is a gun, a family picture album, a doily, your old man's fishnet stocking leg lamp or his monetary fortune. You posess it and it is yours to do what you choose with it. Why the fuck should the government be entitled to take a portion of my hard earned wealth I want to pass to my son so they can give it to some crack whore mother so she can have things she didn't work for. Hell, if she wants some of my money, she can come ask for a handout. I'm a very charitable person. But I decide how and where my money goes. I don't need the gubmint being the middle man. If you decided you need a piece of my financial pie and went about coming in my house to confiscate it for yourself, I'd be justified in a court of law for putting a nice grouping in your chest to stop you. Why should the gubmint be able to do by force what citizens are not allowed to by gubmint law?

Get it thru your head. A person's possessions belongs to them and they can do with it what they will and can give it to whoever they choose. You are not entitled to it if they don't want you to have it and the gubmint shouldn't be able to take it by force and give it to you. If they do.......what are you going to give in return?

</quote>

gifting and estate taxes are separate issues. and since the gun falls under the limit, its not taxed anyway. try again......

also, if you wanted to legally pass on your estate and it was over the $5M threshold, go hire and lawyer and he will be able to limit the estate taxes. stop making excuses.
