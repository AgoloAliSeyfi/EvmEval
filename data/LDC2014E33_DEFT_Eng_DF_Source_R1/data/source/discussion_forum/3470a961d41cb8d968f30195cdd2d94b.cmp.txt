Here comes the concrete thinker. I would be surprised that someone can't grasp what I meant, but it's you, so........

I grasp exactly what you meant, that's why I said it was idiotic. There are no taxes that people don't pay. They all come out of someone's pocket. You said our system "taxes dollars, not people." What part didn't I understand?

</quote>

LOL. It went completely over your head. I'll give this one more try....

Our system taxes dollars in that...it doesn't care who earns the money, but if anyone earns x dollars, they are paying a certain percentage. If you earn more one year, and less the next year, the amount you pay will change because the rate is attached to the dollars, not the person.

If the rate was attached to the person, you could earn a million dollars this year, pay X percentage of taxes and next year lets say you lose your job, go broke and make nothing, you would still be paying the same amount because the rate is attached to you, not the dollars. That's not how our system is, thankfully.

Of course taxes come out of someones pocket, that's not at all what I was referring to. Whether you agree with this or not, I hope this makes sense now, but I'm not holding my breath.

That's not true. The rate is attached to the activity, not the dollar. Hence GE paid zero in corporate taxes but I paid taxes in years where I lost money.

That's the problem with using the tax code to execute social engineering. It underfunds the government and does nothing to help those worst off.

The major one I was referring to is capital gains and the fact that its taxed at a lower rate than income.

</quote>

But that is not a loophole...it is a separate tax altogether and is really a tax on "unearned" income in theory..........and it is available to anyone...whether they are incested in one share of IBM or a million shares of Microsoft.

</quote>

It's a loophole in that many of the wealthy derive their income in this manner, it's why Warren Buffet is able to have a lower overall tax rate than his secretary.

</quote>

Buffett pays a lower rate than his secretary because he can afford to manipulate his income. If you removed the "loophole" as you call it he would just use some other means to accomplish the same end. Also, it's not necessarily bad that he pays a 17% rate on his personal income. If that rate doubled would he continue the same economic activity? Would the government receive more funding as a result?

Yet the left doesn't talk about taxing the dollar. They talk about taxing those evil, greedy, rich, 1% bastards who are stealing wealth from the average American paying their "fair share". You know, the 1% who pay 43% of federal taxes while 47% of the remaining 99% pay nothing.

</quote>

Actually they do...the plans call for taxing incomes of over 1 million dollars, not specific people. The legislation never says we want to tax, Bill Gates or Ruport Murdoch, etc, specifically.

The Alternative Minimum Tax started out as a "millionaires tax." How has that worked out?
