"What have the poor done to deserve our support?"

They built and maintain this Nation. Do rich people do anything besides go to "meetings"?

I think he was talking about those on welfare that choose to sit on there asses on welfare and do not even bother to look for work. Not the poor who look for work and are just having a hard time finding it.
I'll answer the question, those who choose to sit on their asses and not help themselves do not deserve the help of others. Those that at least try to find work and do better for themselves deserve our help to get them on their feet.

And how many of those types do you think there are? Let's see...ONCE AGAIN... we have a real unemployment number(including those that gave up) of 12-15%.

So at the high end... that's 60 million people....let's break that down, shall we?

How many are disabled?

How many are just temporarily receiving benefits?

How many are REALLY working the system?

I dont know. ANd it doesnt matter.
What matters is we have a very large number of people who think a gov't check is a reasonable alternative to finding work. And our system has fostered that belief. We need to reform the system (not just welfare) to make it possible fr people to enter the workforce and stay there and advance.

Someoen with no skills isn't worth minimum wage. That's why they're unemployed. Reduce min wage and we can see some job growth. And as people develop skills from their starter job they will earn more.

Now we can see why you are such a rocket scientist

Just what we need to help people escape poverty....slashing wages and benefits

So Rabbi...according to your economic model. If you are paying some guy minimum wage to sweep your floors, if you slash minimum wage you will now hire two guys to sweep your floors

One needs that capacity to begin with.

Sociopathic personalities don't.

I happen to agree with Rabbi

Welfare needs to provide two things. A safety net and a path out.

While conservatives rant about how the safety net allows the poor to live in the lap of luxury with flat screen TVs, microwave ovens and cell phones, most poor live in bad neighborhoods with bad schools and few job prospects

As to a path out....that's where it gets tricky. We need to provide good schools, jobs related training, low cost childcare and jobs programs that not only provide a foot in the door but some type of career path

Most importantly, the poor need to do more to help themselves. Low marriage rates, fractured family structures, teenaged pregnancy all help to ensure they do not escape poverty

And poverty programs all support and reward exactly those things you correctly identify as keeping people in poverty.
Maybe htis is a breakthrough.
