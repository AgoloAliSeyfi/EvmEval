Modern terrorists derive their inspiration from Mohammed and carry out atrocities in the name of his god.

Christians derive their inspiration from the one who said, "Blessed are the peacemakers" (Matthew 5:9).

people who bomb abortion clinics and shoot abortion providers and their staffs are real peacemakers.

Islam grew by killing anyone opposed to it.

Christianity grew by the blood of its martyrs, meaning people who suffered persecution, torture, and death because they believed in Christ. They died for their convictions offering no resistance or violence.

Imagine there's no Heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace

You may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world

You may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one

Mohammed spread Islam by force, the choices being either conversion, death or enslavement.

Christ sought voluntary conversion (Acts 3:19). His faith is for "whosoever will" to receive, and all men are permitted to reject it. (Revelation 22:17, John 3:16).

Prohibition of music is well documented in Islam.

<quote>
Allah said, what translated means, "And of mankind he who purchases idle talks to mislead (people) from the Path of Allah without knowledge, and takes it (the Path of Allah) by way of mockery, For such there will be a humiliating torment." [31:6].

Al-Wahidi (RadiyAllahu`anhuma), along with other scholars of Tafsir (explaining the Qur'an), said that "Idle Talk" in this Ayah is singing. The following companions gave this Tafsir: Ibn Abbas, Ibn Masud, Mujahid and Ikrimah (RadiyAllahu`anhum). Ibn Masud (RadiyAllahu`anhu) said, "By Allah, whom there is no God except Him, idle talk is singing."

The Prophet (SallAllahu `alayhi wa sallam) said (which means), "From among my followers there will be some people who will consider illegal sexual intercourse, the wearing of silk, the drinking of alcoholic drinks and the use of musical instruments, as lawful. And there will be some people who will stay near the side of a mountain and in the evening their shepherd will come to them with their sheep and ask them for something, but they will say to him, 'Return to us tomorrow.' Allah will destroy them during the night and will let the mountain fall on them, and He will transform the rest of them into monkeys and pigs and they will remain so till the Day of Resurrection." [Al-Bukhari Volume 7, Book 69, Number 494v].

ETC.

No, they are violent and usually psychotic idiots who operate on the fringes and who when caught, are imprisoned and even executed.

In the 29 years since Roe v. Wade, 7 people (3 doctors, 2 clinic employees, a security guard, and a clinic escort) have been murdered by anti-abortion nutballs.

Compare that to the carnage done in ONE DAY by those who advocate the "Religion of Peace."

The scorecard for yesterday:

<quote>
5/18/2008: Jihadis set a car bomb that kills two Iraqis. (Baghdad, Iraq)
5/18/2008: A Taliban bombing leaves one civilian dead.(Zabul, Afghanistan)
5/18/2008: A religious extremist detonates himself and ends the lives of four Afghan civilians. (Helmand, Afghanistan)
5/18/2008: Fourteen people are blown to bits by a suicide bomber outside a bakery. (Mardan, Pakistan)
5/18/2008: Islamists set off two bombs, killing one person.(Pattani, Thailand)

Read your own article. The Crusades were launched as a reaction against Islamic warmongering and violent conquest.

Liberals decry racism, sexism, and gay bashing, and yet they don't make a peep when its done in the name of Islam. Why? Because they are cowards and hypocrites.

Again, there will be loose cannons of every religion and political class, especially in a society as open as this.

What I'm demonstrating here, of course, are people of a common mind who believe it is their religious duty to kill infidels, namely Western Christians. And I haven't even added what's been going on in Paris, London and Madrid.

So spare me your tired old attempts to compare this to lone, isolated cases like McVeigh and Klebold.

Show me another group that has these many acts of violence on its rap sheet over the course of the last decade, and I'll listen.
