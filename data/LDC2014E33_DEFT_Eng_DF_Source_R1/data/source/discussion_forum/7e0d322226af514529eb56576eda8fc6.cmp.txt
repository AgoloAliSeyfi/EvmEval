Just remember that it takes a village so that conloons like Curve don't ran amuck across the countryside being chased by people with pitchforks and torches.

What yo-yos they are.

You have made a claim, that Japan offered to Surrender in 1945 NUMEROUS times before either bomb was dropped. PROVE it. The ONLY offer they ever made was through the Soviets and that was not a surrender it was a cease fire with a pullback to the 1941 Line for all sides. And according to this offer nothing else would be done to the Japanese.

After the first bomb was dropped they made an offer with 4 demands. We rejected it. After the second bomb and the Soviet Declaration of War and Invasion Japan's Emperor ordered an immediate surrender with no Conditions. The Allies accepted and changed the term to keeping the Emperor as a FIGURE head. Japan surrendered unconditionally.

This is rock solid proof you ignore facts you don't like because I've linked a government website showing japan offered a conditional surrender but you continue to ignore it.....like your twin Starkey.

Your website misinterprets the facts, thus the conclusion is wrong.

You would fail any paper you had to turn in on this subject with that interpretation. The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that you are intellectually anoxeric, refusing to ingest all the evidence. This is not being persuasive, but demagogic on your part.

Curve, the rest of America is not out of step, you are.

Targeting civilians or civilian population centers is always unethical; using weapons of mass destruction makes the situation unimaginably worse from a moral standpoint. By 1945, Japan's military had been crippled to the point of ineffectiveness. A bombing campaign against strategic military and industrial targets could have been carried out with minimal casualties among the US military as well as among Japan's civilian population.

That is exactly what happened:

No, it isn't, unless you believe that the instant vaporization of hundreds of thousands of people can be written off because of their nationality. What a disingenuous claim. I suppose this type of callousness towards the slaughter of civilians should be expected from an avowed Zionist.

two atomic bombs and the Soviet invasion ended the war with very little casualties to Americans. No atomic bombs, no surrender.

Baseless. Nationality is an artificial distinction. The location of a person's birth doesn't make his life any more or less valuable than his neighbor's.

What a goof. The nation states have superseded the Papacy and the Caliphate, and geography grounds an individual's character and values system. The proper course was taken about Nagasaki and Hiroshima.
