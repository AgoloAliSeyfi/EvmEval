Wouldn't you expect them to build mosques in their own territories? They controlled Spain for quite awhile back then. I'm sure there were plenty of Christian churches built during and shortly after the various Crusades in what had formally been Muslim territories.

The Muslim Community Center in NYC that has been termed the Ground Zero Mosque is not a monument of Muslim victory but rather a place of worship that American Muslims would like to build and according to our own Constitution they have the right to build it if they own the property.

I still feel that it would be disrespectful to build on ground zero.

One would expect that? THEY had a Victory on US SOIL. Why do you think the fervant PUSH to build so close to where they murdered so many?

It's a statement by them...as they have done throughout their history.

A victory on US Soil is not in the same league as conquering the U.S.

We have had victories in Iraq and Afghanistan but we have not taken over the land. One might say that Muslims won a victory on 9/11, but in reality all that happened was that America suffered a terrorist attack. If a victory is won by simply killing people then you can say they won a victory. My definition of a victory in war is winning the battle and pushing your enemy out of the territory which was fought for. I do not believe the 9/11 terrorists accomplished that task.

Nor have I seen any proof that those who are associated with the so-called Ground Zero Mosque were in anyway associated with the murderers of 9/11.

You say that this is a statement by them. Maybe that would be the case if they were actually planning on building on the grounds of the World Trade Center. How far away is far enough? 10 blocks? 20 blocks? All of Manhattan? How about all of New York State?

Immie? It doesn't matter. They brought down the very SYMBOL of Western Capitalist Culture. The Twin Towers.

They at the time almost caused an economic collapse.

To them it was good enough.

WHY was the initial project name of this mosque called 'Cordoba Project'?"

WHY was it changed later?

He still makes a good point...one I've made myself.

I have as yet to meet a Muslim I didn't like.

And even tho Sunni Man and I often disagree, I like him personally.

But I still oppose the GZ Mosque for the exact reason Revere put forward.

Just like I would oppose a Shinto Shrine built at Pearl Harbor during WWII or a Glock outlet opening next to the Safeway in Tuscon next month.

When Muslim extremist are no longer plotting to kill us, we can revisit the subject.

You cannot apply vicarious liability to one group and not to another, Missourian.

That is why I have said Revere puts himself into a pretzel shape.

Bullshit. To say a lone gunman with no particular political views and no backing is the same as the thousands of zealots, fueled by $$ and rhetoric of their imams are the same is juvenile and dangerous.

Stop defending terrorism, Madeline. It's not a good thing. Even if you do it by pretending it doesn't exist. It does exist, and it's a fucking crime. Islam is a controlled and carefully orchestrated terrorist movement.

Arizona lunatic acting on his own is not.

There are no groups of right wingers dancing in the streets waving signs that say "Death to Liberals!" or people stepping forward to support this guy's family. If he dies tomorrow, he won't be considered a martyr; there will be no mother saying "I'm proud of what my son did!"

I can't believe you cannot fathom the difference.

</quote>

I know you spoke with passion, Allie, but it is upsetting to read "stop supporting terrorists, Madeline".

A false allegation, Allie. Unless you happen to think that freedom of religion = supporting terrorists.

You stepped on my feelings a bit there, girl.

So if a crime begins and ends with the criminal, according to Palin,

does that mean that in the case of a Jew being murdered in medieval times by someone who had heard the stories of Jews killing children for their blood (the blood libel of Palin's speech)

...that crime ONLY began and ended with the murderer and his act ?

...that crime didn't begin with the stories concocted to demonize Jews?

...that crime didn't begin with vitriolic, inflammatory, inciteful rhetoric spread through that society?

Really? Did she really intend to refute her own argument in the same speech?????

than why the outrage over the Mosque at Ground Zero?

What are you parsing?

What POINT are you trying to relay?

You are MIXING events.

As to the Mosque genius?

The American people have an aversion to allowing the RELIGION of the KILLERS from that day holding SACRED GROUND.

Or aren't you that fucking bright and showing your lackluster brillience at being a Statist moron?

There's a different sort of blood libel.

The context is to simply point out that Palin says one thing, but does another.

For the larger issue, If you are going to take that route, then is Islam an inherently evil/violent religion?

</quote>

what thing has she done and what other thing has she done?

</quote>

The quote in the title is hers. Opposing the mosque is the thing that she has done.

If "crimes begin and end with the criminal who committed them", then why hold an entire religion accountable for the actions of 19 people.

I just answered you.
