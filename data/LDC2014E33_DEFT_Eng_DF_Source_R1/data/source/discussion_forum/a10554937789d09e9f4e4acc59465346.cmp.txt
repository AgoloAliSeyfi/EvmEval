Another thing, you keep mentioning that you only want to address the slaughter of animals by muslims living in the western world. Then why are you using videos from the East? Surely to have a rational argument, the acts done should have come from the same society that you are addressing.

"Bloody torture of 6,000 lambs

Yesterday morning Animal Equality documented the ritual lamb slaughter on the ‘Feast of Sacrifice’ ('Eid al-Adha') or ‘Fiesta Grande’ ('Eid-al-Kebir') in Melilla, Spain. This gruesome slaughter of 6,000 animals was carried out in full view of locals, including children, and animals who were tied up waiting helplessly for their turn. "

Spain is in the East now?

I never said the videos weren't open to question. Some people like yourself argue they're not a true representation of the methods allowed. Obviously the people in those videos disagree.

You made this set of statements:
"do think humans are more intelligent than animals because we have consciousness. I'm not going to go into an argument about you now about why don't we eat other humans instead because its getting a bit idiotic. Also I am pretty sure that even you have more intelligence than the cows here.
"
Why is it a bit idiotic?

There are the marginal cases, why not eat them (apart from say the brain, although we don't eat animal brains for the most part anyway because they tend to cause illness, human or otherwise).

And even if you and I have more intelligence than cows, that doesn't mean every human does. Again, see the argument from marginal cases. Some animals show more intellect than some humans. That is fact.

If you blindly deny that you might as well simply deny every scientific discovery ever made.

Its not my own personal opinion that the videos were wrong, its fact. The reason I used quotes in my earlier post from Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) was to show how the people in the video were wrong, not because I don't think they should have done it like that. Its not open to question.

Why not eat humans even if they show less intelligence than animals? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/lolwut.gif" alt=":lolwut:"/> Because they are still humans. They have something wrong with them like an illness or are comatose, but they are still human. I haven't talked about intellect, I mentioned consciousness. You've just twisted what I wrote previously and added that I've blindly denied something I never even stated.

Didn't read much, from the video looked like the East.

Also 6000 does not equal millions.

Millions of lambs were ritually killed a short time ago.Many Muslims making the claim that it was done in a way that is painless.

So you're simply denying that animals are conscious?

What?
That's like denying that the moon is a satellite.

I suppose science is a dirty word for you then?

This isn't intrinsically an anti-islam thread. Nor am I saying that other religions don't have followers that do things that are similar and worse. Today that's not my focus.

Millions of lambs were ritually killed a short time ago.Many Muslims making the claim that it was done in a way that is painless.

However, I'm unsure of what is really going on. Children were seen to be showing disrespect and a lack of caring. Adults the same.

Even if you claim that animals and humans simply aren't equal, it does not justify harming them. It would be like claim I am above someone else therefore I can do what I want to them. It doesn't make any sense.

This video shows the lambs, which appear to be in a great deal of pain, being killed.

My question is, how is that peaceful? Or justified?
In this day and age in the western world it has become increasingly easy to be a vegan. So why would you put animals intentionally through unnecessary pain and suffering?

Graphic video in spoiler:
Spoiler:

2 minutes in you see a lamb killed.

6.44 what looks like salt is put over where the wound will be. Will this not worsen the pain?

I often criticise the meat industry. This thread is not about that. It is instead aimed at Muslims living in the western world.
