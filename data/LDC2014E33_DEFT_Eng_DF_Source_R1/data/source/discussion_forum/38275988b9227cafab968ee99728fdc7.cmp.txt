Why do conservatives advocate bureaucrats being between you &amp; a doctor?...

It's the same as the government being between you and a doctor with universal healthcare. The only difference is the government will put all the competition out of business and then Americans will have only one provider. At least with our current system there is some competition.

Funny how the private companies spend about 31 cents out of ever dollar on administration. Medicare spends about 3 cents.
That's why the private companies can't compete... they're bloated.

Nice liberal spin. Here's the truth:

But like many core beliefs of the left, the claim that government-run health care has lower administrative costs than private care is just plain false. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, for example, likes to cite data showing that Medicare only spends 3% of its total outlays on administrative costs compared to 14-22% for private care. The numbers themselves are correct, but measuring administrative efficiency by a percentage of total costs is completely useless. Heritage fellow Robert Book explains:

Imagine, for a moment, that Fred and Jane each have a credit card from a different bank. Fred charges $5,000 a month, and Jane charges $1,000 a month. Suppose it costs each bank $5 to produce and send a plastic credit card when the account is opened. That $5 administrative cost is a much lower percentage of Freds monthly charges than it is of Janes, but that does not mean Freds bank is more efficient. It is purely a mathematical artifact of Freds charging pattern, and it would be silly to compare the efficiency of bank operations on that basis. Yet that is how many analysts compare Medicare with private insurance.

A much more accurate way of capturing each systems true administrative costs is by a per-patient basis. When this is done, government-run health cares administrative costs are routinely higher than private care. In the years from 2000 to 2005, Medicares administrative costs per beneficiary were consistently higher than that for private insurance, ranging from 5 to 48 percent higher, depending on the year. This is despite the fact that private-sector administrative costs include state health insurance premium taxes of up to 4 percent (averaging around 2 percent, depending on the state)an expense from which Medicare is exemptas well as the cost of non-claim health care expenses, such as disease management and on-call nurse consultation services.

Do you really want a government employee telling you what you need and what you don't need when it comes to you and your family's health????

It is EXACTLY the same thing.

I want both a doctor AND and an insurance company "employee" taking care of my medical needs. Ever notice what the cost of a medical procedure is without insurance? Ever notice how some doctors perform unnecessary tests, increase the number of doctor's visits, etc., so they can make more money? I would never put my health needs soley in the hands of a doctor.

I've had clinic bureaucrats come between me and treatment because, even though I flashed a pocketful of $100.00 bills in their faces, I had no insurance.

Now, that's fucked up.
