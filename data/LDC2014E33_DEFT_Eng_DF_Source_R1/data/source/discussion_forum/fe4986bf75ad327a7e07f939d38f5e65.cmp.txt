Today's gift to truthers, courtesy of <a href="http://media.nara.gov/9-11/MFR/t-0148-911MFR-00631.pdf">Indianapolis TMU supervisor Steve Lutomski</a> (my emphasis):

<quote>
On the floor, Lutomski heard about some controllers looking for AA77. Lutomski assumed the Military Operation Specialist position for the day and was on the phone with the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center as they were calling for information on AA77.

Lutomski received a call on the military phone advising that there was a beacon code on a hijacked aircraft heading towards Indi. He entered this code on the screen and saw the beacon of UAL93. He was able to watch UAL93 slowly descend and circle for about one hour.

<a href="http://media.nara.gov/9-11/MFR/t-0148-911MFR-00633.pdf">Jeffery Philips, Indianapolis ATC</a>, is another example of how it took a while to realise what was going on:

<quote>
Philips was at a radar position in area 7 when coworkers came back from break and informed him about the WTC. He was then told by his supervisor to begin looking for AA77. Philips then began to clear the predicted path of AA77. He thought AA77 had an electrical failure; even though this is not common in a 757, it could have happened.

When Philips heard about the Pentagon crash, he still thought AA77 was airborne but he quickly drew the parallel and thought it was a hijack situation.

</quote>
So he hears about the WTC, doesn't make the connection when AA77 goes missing, and only begins to think it's hijacked after the plane has crashed.

<a href="http://media.nara.gov/9-11/MFR/t-0148-911MFR-00634.pdf">Linda Povinelli, Indianapolis Air Traffic Control Supervisor</a>, seems to be the one who decided AA77 has most probably crashed:

<quote>
Povinelli recalls that there were 15 people scheduled for the day shift and John Thomas was her supervisor. While in the supervisor's office, Povinelli received a page form the floor that read "think we lost an aircraft." She then ran down to Area 3 and started an assessment of the situation. Povinelli called American Airlines to report the NaRDO and loss of transponder and also called the other sectors in front of AA77' s flight path.

On the scope, she saw a slight tum in the path of AA77 before it lost communication but
assumed that the tum was an ordinary correction. Her first thought was a crash, so
Povinelli called the state police for a search and rescue of the area where AA77
disappeared.

At this time, the controllers had already hit the all primary. Povinelli was not. aware that
AA77 had reappeared in' the Henderson sector of Indi's airspace.

<a href="http://media.nara.gov/9-11/MFR/t-0148-911MFR-00648.pdf">Professor Robert Jervis of Columbia University</a> offers this take on the idea that warnings should have let people to anticipate the nature of the 9/11 attack:

<quote>
Prof. Jervis criticized the notion that 'dots were there but we did not connect them' as being totally irrelevant. He speculated that, if a different terrorist group had detonated a radiological dispersion device on September 10, there probably would be 'dots' about that incident as well. He said that the problem is that there are so many dots about so many potential threats, and that most of the dots are unreliable, false, or late. He asked rhetorically when the IC should have begun to focus on al-Qa'ida rather than other groups. He suggested that we look at whether a large percentage of information coming into CTC is misleading or otherwise very difficult to verify. More generally, he noted that the more information the IC collects, the harder it is to analyze due to the volume. He also noted that the Ie sometimes becomes so invested in certain sources that it is hard for the IC to accept that the sources are unreliable (this phenomenon occurred in World War II when German intelligence refused to believe that its agents in Britain had been compromised).

However Jervis also says:

<quote>
According to Prof. Jervis, outgoing National Security Adviser Sandy Berger told incoming National Security Adviser Condi Rice that al Qa'ida was the number-one threat, yet she did not act on this information.

<a href="http://media.nara.gov/9-11/MFR/t-0148-911MFR-00662.pdf">Tom Kinton, Director of Aviation for Massport</a>, on the post-9/11 bin Laden flight:

<quote>
Kinton recalled the September 19, 2001 charter flight to Logan to pick up Bin Laden family members. There was much confusion at that time with respect to air space and he wanted to make sure everyone that needed to know was involved (State Department, FBI and the State police). The FBI advised him to let the flight come. He remembered that the flight came out of Los Angeles going on to Orlando, Dallas, Boston, Gander and London, that a police officer got off in Boston, and that the FBI and Customs were there
to meet the airplane. He saw the manifest, and will provide a copy to the Commission.

Kinton stated that there were some flights he was concerned with coming out of Canada in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, but nothing related to the Bin Laden family. He felt they needed to watch the Canadian border carefully because there had been many overseas flights grounded in Canada and he wanted to make sure individuals coming into the U.S. from those flights were on the approved list to come in here.
