But "Governments" DO Conspire To Injure Their Own Citizens, and then scramble to hide and cover these atrocities up....

I always bring up "Gladio" and the other Secret NATO Armies as an example because it is so CONCRETE, so real. The Prime Minister of Italy copped to it all. Spoke directly about it, his government''s culpability.

It is the Prime Minister of Italy saying this, not an armchair theorist that does not know squat AND the Italian Prime Minister accused French President Mitterrand of knowing a thing or two about it as well and on and on and on.

I am assuming at this time anyway, you reserve the term "conspiracy theory" for pejorative contexts, when there is no substance to it. Is that correct John Albert? Surely you are not denying the reality of Gladio and the other Secret armies of NATO and nefarious governmental activities in general now are you?????

I have talked about what I think Gladio before. It is not clear what the actual conspiracy claim is. I am not sure about whether it's existence was ever denied, although there is no doubt there was an Operation Gladio and that only a few people knew about it.

If your claim is that governments or the CIA or something else official was linked to things like the assassination of Julien Lahaut or the Nijvel Gang or the Bologna Massacre that's a big stretch. It's much more believable these were things that happened because governments or the CIA or something else official had lost control over the elements of Operation Gladio that they initially created.

We all agree that Operation Gladio was atrocious, but what exactly is the conspiracy claim claim here? What exactly makes it 'like' a conspiracy theory? What exactly is it that makes its discovery like a conspiracy theory that got found out?

Denial......

It was acknowledged, at least in some sense, as a NATO operation....

Who is the fattest cat in NATO?......

Many conspiracies are broad in scope by necessity. Too broad and violate to be associated with a specific protagonist(s). As in the rich in America are getting richer but nobody seems to be able to do what is necessary to reverse that trend.

In other words there are three intertwined conspiracies. One conspiracy that has enabled the rich to become richer.

A second conspiracy to keep the rich getting richer.

A third conspiracy to keep anyone from reversing what is enabling the rich to keep getting richer.

In any case, prior to the uncovering of Gladio, I have not seen evidence of any Conspiracy Theory surmizing it's existence.

ETA: plus the existence of Gladio does not prove that any other CT is correct.
