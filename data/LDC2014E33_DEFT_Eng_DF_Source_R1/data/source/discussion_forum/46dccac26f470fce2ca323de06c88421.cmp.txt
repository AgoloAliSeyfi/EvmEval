What I think is going on is not so much working class people turning against Blair, but middle class voters who feel betrayed and lied to over Iraq.

If you take out the Iraq factor, things are getting a bit better for ordinary people in UK. Even the tories accept public services must come before tax cuts.

But the managerial and professional classes on whom the govt relies to actually administer and run the country are absolutely seething, not that we had to go to war per se, but because Blair deceived everybody about the real necessity for war. That was unforgiveable for a lot of people.

So the wheels begin to come off the Blair band wagon...

And [Labour MPs] claimed to be livid about Mr Cameron's wish to stop Scottish MPs from voting on purely English laws. Tony Blair huffed that it would create two classes of MPs and so would be alien to the constitution, a view which would carry more weight if the constitution actually existed.

Prescott (Blair's deputy) is in hot water today, if only from the media.

Blair is sticking closely by him, or at least he has up to now. But this is damaging Blair.
So now our Tone must decide: is Prescott liable to do more damage to the Blair government outside the tent, or in?

Again parliamentary sketch-writer Simon Hoggart, a week or two ago - coming away with the impression that Blair could go on for years...

Tony Blair is amazing. Yesterday morning he spoke to MPs for two and a half hours while scarcely drawing breath and taking, so far as I could see, just three sips of tea from a cardboard cup. The air conditioning struggled with the 33 degrees outside.

By the end, the two dozen MPs (members of the liaison committee, all chairmen of other committees) were wilting like hydrangeas that hadn't seen rain in a month. They were slumped, glassy-eyed and somnolent. [..]

Yet the prime minister was brimming with beans, bursting with energy and verve. Alan Williams, chairman of the chairmen, managed to ask if he thought his "successor" would also hold these sessions. "I think they should be weekly!" he exclaimed. In that time he had spoken fluently, at length, about the problems of the Home Office, alienation in the Muslim community, nuclear power v renewable energy, immigration in Malta, Sinn FÃ©in's position on decommissioning, the narco-economy of Afghanistan, the US supreme court and the religious demographics of Iraq.

He did it without a note. Behind him sat three aides, who spoke not a word to him throughout. You may think what you like about Mr Blair, and many people do, but I cannot imagine that any other government leader in the world could have turned in such a performance. Now and again he even did passion, anger, sadness, and jokes. You just knew that if Mr Williams had said: "This has been fascinating. Would you care to go on for another two hours?" he would have said: "Yes".

The session started with the usual backchat between him and Gwyneth Dunwoody, who said winsomely that she was not allowed to talk to him because she'd been told she upset him. "You would stop me, wouldn't you?" she asked, coyly. "That would be a pointless exercise," he muttered. "I don't see how you can be so cruel to one so young and defenceless," she replied. Gwyneth being flirtatious is like the dancing hippos in Fantasia; it's there right in front of you, but you still can't believe it.

In the past the committee has been unduly deferential. Not now. They pick fights. Edward Leigh challenged him over Iraq. The difference between now and a few years ago was that "if you disagreed with Saddam, you ended up in a mass grave", Mr Blair said. "Oh, come on!" said Mr Leigh. "No, you come on!" Mr Blair barked back. It was like watching Rooney versus Ronaldo.

David Maclean, a former Tory chief whip, got into a row with him about the Home Office. Mr Maclean had been a home office minister when, Mr Blair said, the asylum system had been "a shambles". A Labour MP shouted: "Good luck, David!" Perhaps he was going to offer to hold his jacket. "It was not a shambles!" Mr Maclean shouted back. "Jack Straw never said it was a shambles. Your new home secretary says it's a shambles, and you blame it on an administration from nine years ago!"

Mrs Dunwoody unilaterally decided to end the fight and move on. She is rarely gainsaid. "We were enjoying ourselves," said Mr Blair, a boy brought in from playing football because it's bedtime. "Yes, I rather thought you were, and that was one of my reasons," Mrs Dunwoody said. Mr Blair grinned, but he also quailed. It was like one of those gangsters who order a hit, then quiver when their mother speaks crisply to them.

At one point he was asked whether he actually cared what his cabinet thought about anything. "It would be odd if the prime minister didn't have a firm view on what's the right thing to do," he said, which I read to mean "No".

And this man is about to quit? Not yet, I'd guess, and not for some time.
