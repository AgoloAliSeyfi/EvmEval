I quite agree with your suggestion that the media reports on white victims of knife crime have been disproportionate considering the numbers of black victims also.
It's similar when women commit crimes; if a man was guilty of the same crime he would rarely recieve as much media coverage. This simply reflects the sad bias seemingly inherent in the Press today.

I disagree. Rhys Jones and Ben Kinsella got a lot of reporting because they were middle-class kids who had nothing to do with the gang culture they found themselves killed by. That's why the cases are much more interesting and unusual than a gang member stabbing another gang member. As above for Olivia: women are much less likely to commit murder, so when they do its better reported.

Its fairly clear to me that ethnic victims of racially motivated attacks get a disproportionate amount of media time.
One example is <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1533624/Boy-murdered-by-gang-in-search-of-a-white-victim.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/ukne...te-victim.html</a>. Absolutely awful - a Asian gang cruise Glasgow to find a "white boy", who they then kidnapped, tortured, doused in petrol, set on fire, and murdered. And yet it was barely reported - the BBC is alleged to have deliberately refrained from covering it that much to avoid stoking racial tensions. Background under controversies at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriss_Donald">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriss_Donald</a>
Whenever a ethnic minority person is involved in a race-attack, its very well reported. Just look at the Stephen Lawrence case and compare it to Kriss Donald's.

I don't think there is any institutional racism. There certainly isn't in the police! After the MacPherson report they have been forced to become the most overly-politically-correct institution imaginable by politicians. Its just that certain cases are more interesting than others. If a women commits a murder, its more interesting than if a man does it. Similarly with race crimes: people find it more interesting to read about a minority person being killed than a majority person being killed. Thats just the way of the world im afraid.
