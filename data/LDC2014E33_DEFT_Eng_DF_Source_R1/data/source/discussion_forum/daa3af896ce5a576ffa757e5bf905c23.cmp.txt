Is not relying on Family, friends, and charities an abdication of personal responsibility as well?

You tell me.

No, that is what they are there for.

How is it a "national" disaster?

If only one state was hit yet as much damage and death took place, would it no longer be a "national disaster" in your eyes?

Do you know what a republic is?

Do you have any idea why we are referred to as the "Unites States"?

</quote>

Oh, so now it must have the official "National" disaster label before yo uare Ok with our Federal government helping out your fellow citizens? REALLY? Wow...

</quote>

Dont be a dick.....

I simply asked why it was labelled as a national disater.

I don't see how anything you've posted disproves what I said.

</quote>

He's talking about private citizens.

Are you saying private citizens are not the purview of the US Gov't ???

</quote>

I'm saying that it's not the U.S. government's responsibility to give money to those hit by natural disasters.

Isn't it interesting how Libertarians' desire for "freedom" correspond so neatly with skinflints who don't want to give ANYONE, ANYTHING.

So while libertarianism attracts people who want to be "free" it also attracts cheap assholes who don't want to pay their fair share.

Perhaps when Libertarians figure out a way to differentiate between the two, I'll vote for them.

</quote>

What a disingenuous hack you are. Libertarians/Conservatives give WAAAAY more voluntarily that you do through the force of government. You cry about "paying their fair share", all the while ignoring the FACT that we voluntarily GIVE more than you propose to TAKE.

The reason you libs want to forcibly TAKE from others is that you look in the mirror and KNOW that you wouldn't GIVE of your own free will. You project YOUR shortcomings on everyone else in order to make yourselves feel better about your own tightwadery.

FUCK YOU!!

One more example of a callous conservative. Who was it that claimed libealism was a mental disease? Oh yeah, Michael Weiner, a conservative radio host whose rants are reflective of the the anger expressed by GuyP.

Im sorry but I agree with him. The people should have insurance. RENTAL insurance is cheap like 200 a year or less.. IF you own a house you should have insurance.. No excuses..

</quote>

I used to rent and had rental insurance. Please explain to me how rental insurance gets you clothing, water, food, shelter, transportation, etc. right NOW, when these people need it the most?

</quote>

Apparently you don't pay attention to what people post..

Private charities are down there making sure people get what they need.

As one poster pointed out - restaurants are handing out free food, local stores are supplying free gloves, hard hats, people are going down there to volunteer, people are donating money to fund the effort..

The federal government is NOT needed - they are NOT the only solution.

When people need help - the help comes from good people - not the ugly federal government.

Besides, we don't need politicians throwing money at a community while they scratch their bellies then say; "remember me in November - you owe me."

It likely wont.
But I bet not one would go hungry or without a roof if government WAS NOT expected to help out.
Government gets in the way...Americans help Americans....we always had.

Now?

Governemnt red tape gets in the way.

REALLY? SO, why did we have 131,000 homeless veterans in the 2011 data? Aren't our service personnel especially near and dear to the hearts of the right? Do you have one living with you yet? If not, why not?

</quote>

you dont know me well enough to make that assumption.

I share a mortgage on a home that I have never lived in nor do I collect rent on it.
I have been paying 1400 a month for 8 years for it...that incluides real estate taxes.
I have never net the folks that live there...I am anaonymous...my attorney handles everything.
The foiks that live there are veterans and their families.

Sure...you can say "it is an investment"...and in a way, it is.......for when the time comes, I will sell it off.

But for now, people are enjoying the conmfort of a roof over their head.

FYI....there was a lien put on the property because the people did not pay their water bill for 4 years.....so I paid it without questioning.

So what do you do for your fellow man?

Just criticize them for being like you?

</quote>

I take care of a Vietnam Veteran. I call him "Dad". As for providing a roof, I applaud you, but until you provide concerted care and have to pay out of pocket for it all, go cry to your "attorney". I can't afford one.
