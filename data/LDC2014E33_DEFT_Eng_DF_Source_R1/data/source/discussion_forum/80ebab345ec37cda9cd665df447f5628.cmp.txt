Hmm, thanks for the detailed response. Still it seems like a lot is left to chance. 70% is not an odd I want to play when there is a 30% chance of complete destruction.

Absolutely, and this is the issue. Those are the most effective systems, and sadly 70% is probably the best we're ever going to achieve.

Thankfully, though, these systems span in huge "webs" across America and much of Europe. And that's a 70% success rate from one ABS system within that web. Combine them together, and it raises to 140%, 230%, 300% etc. <img src="images/smilies/tongue.png"/>

However, I agree. 70% is still far too much left to chance. These systems do cooperate, but they are too far apart for my liking. An effective AB system to me would utilize everything we have that could possibly damage or destroy an ICBM and I'd create a wall that would hopefully increase that percentage enough to ensure nothing could pass.

Unfortunately, they fly quite quickly. I'm not sure the response time of our aircraft or AB systems, but I'd bet that an ICBM from Iran would reach Europe a lot quicker.

I'm afraid you're wrong there.

Were China to fully begin military operations on a global scale, there is nothing that could hold them back. America's military might is beyond super-power, but technology doesn't win a battle. China's vast numbers and the ability to move vast amounts of equipment, supplies and ammunition behind the advancing forces would see a catastrophic war.

Throw a supportive Russia and Iran into the mix, and leave us with Israel, much of NATO and ourselves, we'd be walked over. America, as I said, is the dominant superpower in terms of military might on this planet. However, should China be pushed and prodded enough to initiate a full-blown war, in which it would certainly begin a state of drafting every able bodied person, and then use the rest to create vast droves of equipment, America just couldn't compete.

America's forces are by no means small. The USMC is the smallest of America's fighting forces, and they still outnumber our combined military force, but China could draft millions upon millions of men and would have the ability to arm them all. Remember, there's an AK47 for every 11 people on the planet. And considering the entirety of China's dedicate armed forces utilize the Type-95 Rifle among others, they could arm every single civilian they draft in with arguably the best assault rifle in the world, magazines aplenty, food and water and send them out.

It depends on the system. Most use a second explosion (so another rocket) to destroy the main body of the ICBM. You can't detonate a nuclear warhead with an explosion, it doesn't work that way, so they aren't concerned about throwing large explosions at it. Even if it doesn't fully destroy the whole ICBM, it certainly wont be flying anywhere, and thus its usefulness is simply non-existent afterwards.

Others use a solid round, such as the American GMD. It fires a large projectile at it and just blows a hole through it. Once again, the ICBM is no longer able to operate.

Finally, the American's 747 uses a laser to fry the targeting systems. It just drops from the sky after that.

Most systems can only acclaim to be around 30-40% effective at best. Which isn't ideal, but the principal of "fire-enough-at-it-and-hope-for-the-best" still works effectively here.

Iran can't stand against America and the UK in a conventional war. If we had the help of the nations you named, then we'd crush them even more so. But we'd have to go in and fully root out any lasting military forces.

Even without dedicated leadership, I would wager that NCOs and remaining Officers could still organize effective guerilla-war type actions against the invading forces. An ambush of anti-armour and anti-infantry weaponry would destroy a convoy, and that's something we can't be seen to lose. So we'd send in forces to dig out and destroy the remaining military-capable enemy combatants. Thankfully, we have the technology to do that, though I'd imagine it would return to an Afghan-like state of trying to get the enemy out of their holes, and that takes time, money, resources and most importantly, lives.

Oh I see. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/holmes.gif" alt=":holmes:"/>

Thanks. <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

Hopefully it won't escalate into a war. I bet Dave is feeling pretty stupid for scrapping half of our missiles and armed forces? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/>

I wonder if they will introduce conscription etc..... if it gets really bad? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/erm.gif" alt=":erm:"/> I say strike and destroy thier parliament/senate building and the president/PM house when **** seems to happen. Maybe a wave of assasinations on key people in Iran perhaps? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/holmes.gif" alt=":holmes:"/>
