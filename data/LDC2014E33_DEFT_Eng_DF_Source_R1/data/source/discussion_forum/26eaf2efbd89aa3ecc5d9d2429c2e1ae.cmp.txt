There's some interesting stuff in this story: <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,1882711,00.html">I'm backing Brown, Prescott declares</a>

In re: to deputy prime minister John Prescott confirming that he will support Gordon Brown as the party's future leader, it notes:

Mr Prescott's remarks last night infuriated many Blairites who increasingly fear that their stock is falling. One pessimistic ally of the prime minister admitted that he was doubtful any Blairite candidate would be able to gather the necessary number of nominations to stand. The names of all nominees have to be published, and some Brownites suggested that a Blairite candidate was as many as 10 short of the 43 MPs required to mount a candidature. [..]

Mr Prescott is the second cabinet minister to depart from the agreement reached at last week's cabinet meeting not to make announcements on the leadership at the conference. The foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, also endorsed Mr Brown this week.

The only lingering hope for Blairites is that the party will sense that the chancellor is not electable, and over the next few months start to shift to another candidate. The only possibilities will be the home secretary, John Reid, the education secretary, Alan Johnson, and the environment secretary, David Miliband.

Mr Johnson sidestepped questions about his leadership ambitions yesterday as he used his speech to announce measures for children in care and the end of coursework for maths GCSE. Speaking at the end of the session on education and health, which was dominated by the row over NHS privatisation, he was politely, though not rapturously, received.

On a lighter note, it also has a scary photo ("mirror, mirror, who's the scariest of them all"):

John Reid put himself in pole position to challenge Gordon Brown for the Labour leadership yesterday when he earned a standing ovation for a speech in which he vowed the British will not be browbeaten by Muslim bullies.

The resources of the security services will have nearly doubled since 9/11, from £800m in 2001 to £1.4bn next year. But it is clear that Tony Blair does not yet believe that the security services are up to the task of tackling the scale and new nature of the al-Qaida threat in Britain.
