[COLOR="Blue"][SIZE="4"][FONT="Book Antiqua"]I don't know how to go about seeking vengence on BP for desecration of the Gulf. I am beside myself. My best friend #3 was going to St. George Island with her family for Mother's Day this weekend. But they will probably cancel because the oil slick will have reached those sugary sand beaches by then.

About a month after the ocean's shores have been befouled, the inland waterways will begin showing the devasation. The Wakulla River, where my kidlet taught me to canoe. The St. John's River, where we hung out in a biker bar in St. Mark's on Fridays after work, eating broiled shrimp and drinking cheap beer, just watching the Earth do it's thing.

Eventually the oil will travel the underground and above-ground aquifer to every Florida body of water, including the beleagered Everglades...a natural phenomena unparrelled on Planet Earth and precious not only to Florida, but to the entire Planet for the role it plays in our wildlife, ecosystem and so on.

Death would not be too severe a punishment for BP's CEO, as I see it.

Don't buy BP gasoline!

Try to boycott, especially if you are purchasing large quantities for a commercial trucking, farming or airline business.

I welcome any additional ideas on how to afflict BP.

I am just heart broken. I cannot tell you what this preventable insult to the Earth will be like for all of Florida, and beyond.

Yea, lets all boycott BP and just buy all our oil and fuel from other companies that get their oil by drilling for it. That'll show the BIG OIL industry! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

How about we prohibit off-shore drilling TOTALLY? Make the oil companies dismantle the freaking rigs? Given that the Alaska Pipeline is now like 30 years old and has a decent track record, "DRILL IN ALASKA" together with a REAL push towards reducing energy waste?

I happen to think if Tom Hayward got the needle, fewer oil spills would occur. Even making him do a 20 year stretch would have the desired detterent effect. I bet that would chill a helluva lot of reckless conduct. Merely because a regulation hammered out by Big Oil's lobbyists says something is adequate does NOT alter the laws of physics...a thing which explodes and belches millions of gallons of oil on the oceans is NOT SAFE.

I would have a freaking solar power thingie on my roof if one were available at a cost that made sense. How is it we can seriously be discussing putting a Man on Mars and yet wind and solar technology have made so few strides? Oil and coal continue to be consumed because Big Oil and Big Coal profit from it, not because us little people don't wish for better.

Kiss mah azz, WBooth. I have sat and listened as lobbyists for Big Oil pleaded with Florida legislators to allow more rigs near that state's shoreline. What they say in public is nauseating enough. What goes on behind closed doors or after hours rivals a scene from "Caligulla".

If you need a BJ or a kneecapper to persuade legislators to see things your way, that may be a Clue That Your Are An Ethical Seephole.

BP fucking knew....EVERYONE knew. A freaking first grader would have known.

If that spill had been caused by Pakistani terrorists, and not by BP's fuck-ups, we'd be at WAR.

And then, BP can put their prices up to try and recoup some of their losses and the other big bad oil companies will follow suit because it'll mean even bigger profits for them. hey presto, we lose... again.

Boycott. Don't boycott. Ain't gonna make a damn's worth of difference.
