If Obama has good motives for reneging on his promises and defending the indefensible, then he should come forward and explain. His silence in the face of the actions of his Administration is just as intolerable as the hypocrisy.

That's how I see it, too. I was just asking to explore the argument.

Thomas would this be a good time for me to invite everyone to my facebook page to join the "Should Have Elected Hillary" group?

No, Bipolar Bear. For one thing, it's moot; for another thing, Hillary Rodham Clinton has many virtues, but I don't expect that limiting her own powers would be one of them.

Well, we were wrong about Obama (at least in this case), maybe we're wrong about Hillary to.

@Debra Law,

Thanks for the link.

I don't think he was hammering PrezBO for the reason you think...

I'm glad to see coverage picking up. I was quite frustrated when I started this thread.

More areas of frustration arise that make Obama appear extremely weak in the area of civil rights.

President Obama said officials involved in the questionable interrogations would not be subject to prosecution because the intelligence community must be provided "with the confidence" it needs to do its job.

"This is a time for reflection, not retribution," he said. "I respect the strong views and emotions that these issues evoke. We have been through a dark and painful chapter in our history. But at a time of great challenges and disturbing disunity, nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past."

Amnesty's Cox rejected that argument.

"The United States has had plenty of time for reflection -- there is very little information in the newly released material that hadn't leaked out long before," he said. Obama "also said that the United States is a nation of laws. But laws only have meaning if they are enforced.

"The United States has laws prohibiting torture, and two-thirds of Americans support an investigation into what has been done in their name. That is not seeking to lay blame; that is a call for justice long overdue."

<quote>
Kabul, Afghanistan - As Fatima Fedayee clutched a banner that read "Equality Is Our Right," an angry man charged toward her and knocked her to the ground. As soon as she picked herself up, another man hurled stones at her. Then a group of men surrounded her, screaming unsavory epithets.

But Ms. Fedayee kept holding the banner, chanting "Islam means equality!" She kept up the rallying cry for more than an hour Wednesday, alongside nearly 300 other women, protesting a law that they say would greatly restrict women's freedoms.

These demonstrators belong to a women's movement that has emerged with unusual boldness in recent weeks to fight the law. Unlike other campaigns around gender issues, this marks one of the few times women have openly confronted the conservative attitudes in this country " and the first time in years they have demanded their rights in a public demonstration. Like Fedayee, many have withstood hostile, even violent, opposition " sometimes from other women.

"We've been silent for all of these years, but we can't tolerate this anymore," Fedayee says.

Law would empower husbands

The law that sparked the outrage " which was passed by both houses of parliament and signed late last month by President Hamid Karzai " regulates the actions of women of the Shiite minority, which makes up about 15 percent of the population. Among the bill's many articles, activists point to a few particularly oppressive statutes: that women should get their husband's permission before leaving the house, and husbands have the right to have sex with their wives whenever they wish.

An outpouring of international criticism has pushed President Karzai to shelve the bill for now and pledge to reconsider any portions of the law that contradict the Afghan constitution, which guarantees equal rights for men and women. The measure also stipulates that no law should contradict Islam " a fact some conservatives use to argue that the law in question can be reconciled with the constitution....

@Debra Law,

Come on, Debra, which president enforces human rights at a time of -- gasp -- disunity? Certainly you didn't believe that Obama's posturing next to Lincoln was ever more than campaign candy -- or did you?
