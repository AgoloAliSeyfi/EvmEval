No, we don't know that. People like get involved and I are still fighting to MAKE it happen. What illegal immigration has done to the workforce is criminal, and needs to be addressed. As long as there are people willing to stand up for what is right, there is a chance that we can get something done.

Why not make them legal?

Give them migrant work Visas. Allow them to work, pay taxes, stop hiding. Allow them to go home when they want and come back to work.
Allow them to apply for citizenship and get credit for the time they have been here

ok....are they also going to have to pay a sum of cash for the back taxes they did not pay?....

</quote>

How would you determine what they owe? There's no records of stolen social security numbers...

No

Because given the chance they would have gladly accepted a fair wage and paid a tax on it

If anything, those who employed them should have to pay back taxes

The problem with most of you liberals is that you never know what the fuck you're talking about. I've been saying throughout this thread that the criminal employers need to be prosecuted. It's Obama and Bush before him that won't follow the damned LAW.

I've been in the construction trades most of my adult life and I'd be HAPPY to start working those jobs again. My only problem is that I'm an American who is expected to pay his bills and his taxes, which is impossible to do on the current wages paid for those construction jobs.

You see, I've got responsibilities to my family like college for my kid, insurance for my car, payments to the doctor, etc., etc.... I can't live 8 people in a 2 bedroom house, I can't use the ER as a clinic, I can't give a false or stolen Social Security number and avoid paying taxes.

And just for the record moron, it's got nothing to do with skin color. That racist canard is old, tired and wrong.

No, of course it isn't.

I always am amazed how you think these illegals are all lving large on your dime.

I know a lot of people in the trades, and they are doing fine. Of course, no one is building houses right now because we already have more than the market can sell, but blame the illegals for your woes...

I'm always kind of amused that you guys want to fire all the government workers because they are making too much money, but you have a fit when someone undercuts your salary.

Bullshit! They claimed 'Exempt' and paid NOTHING! Why worry about it, when the wages get reported to the IRS they go after the REAL owner of that SS number!
