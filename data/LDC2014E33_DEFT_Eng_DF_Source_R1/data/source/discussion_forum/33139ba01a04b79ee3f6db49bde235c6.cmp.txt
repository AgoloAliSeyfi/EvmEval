While I disagree with his use of the word "snob" and the other comment - something to the effect of Obama wanting to liken people in his image, I do agree with where he was going with this (and I don't agree with Santorum on about anything else).
College isn't for everyone, we have a high drop-out rate for freshman (who still have to pay back debt they incur for the time they are there). It's very much sold as an American dream (like owning a home) and that's wrong. There is a lot of jobs for those who have experience in skilled trades and technical backgrounds right now, but not enough people to fill them. Not only do these types of careers provide a stable future - you can make just as much money, if not more, than some professions that require a 4 year degree (when is the last time you had to pay a plumber, carpenter, or electrician - they don't come cheap). I do agree with Santorum that these options should be a larger part of our education discussion. I also agree with him in terms of the word "snob" - not in referring to the POTUS as a snob because that is disrespectful - but we absolutely have evolved over the last few decades into a society that tends to look down on those without college degrees. It makes young people feel like college is the only respectable option and that is just not the case.

I don't think you understand how hard the construction industry has been hit. Who's remodeling homes and businesses right now? Who's building new buildings? No one. And yes, a skilled tradesman makes a great hourly wage, but they do not work the amount of hours a "normal" person does. My DH worked just over 1300 last year. That's less than 25 hours a week.
I work for a large construction Union in one of the biggest trades Union cities in the country and our members are hurting. Big time.

Skilled trades and technical backgrounds is more than construction. It's engineering, healthcare, sciences, etc.
Here's a study that \looks at the market value of sub-baccalaureate awards: <a href="http://www.completecollege.org/path_forward/certificates_count_release/">http://www.completecollege.org/path_forward/certificates_count_release/</a>
There's also a recent peer-reviewed journal article with similar findings in the Journal for Policy Analysis and Management (top policy journal). I'm too lazy to hunt it down, especially since most probably couldn't download it free anyway.
There's definitely a demand for people with long-term certificates and associate's degrees!

She said specified plumber, carpenter and electrician. Those are in the construction trades industry.

I guess I'm still unclear what Obama means by having all kids "college ready". Because if it's something more than math and English proficient then I would say, no, not all kids need to have more than that. Some kids need to have other options during high school. Kids are not one size fit all.

I think every child should have a basic level of proficiency in social studies, too, since they will have the right to vote. And we've seen on these boards what being science-ignorant can do, lol. Of course kids should have options! Being proficient in the basics does not take away options. There are plenty of things they can pick and choose.

But generally, when people throw "college ready" around, they mean math and English.

</quote>

Oh, I'm cool with the basics in all subject areas (and just so you know I know you get it. ;) I just think of some of my students and some of my nieces and nephews and no, they will not be going to college....so I'm not sure what Obama thinks they should have before graduation. I think they should have vocational opportunities in high school too.

By "college ready," I take him to mean that if a student graduates with a high school diploma, he should be able to take an introductory college course - be it English 101, College Algebra, or U.S. History - and have the ability to keep up with the material. That doesn't mean everyone has to go to college. My husband has students who have graduated from high school but who can barely write a coherent sentence and who don't understand the basics of the three branches of government. That has got to change.

Have you guys read the Atlantic article about manufacturing jobs? Basically people with no more than a high school diploma can no longer advance beyond the interchangeable, easily replaced positions because they lack the skills and knowledge and workplaces no longer invest in training. They hire people who had post secondary science/math training for the advancement-eligible jobs. That doesn't mean those people have 4 year degrees, but a HS education is not enough.

Thank you! I knew I had just read about this issue and was racking my brain to recall in what publication the article could be found. I feel as though I can now carry on with my day, LOL.
