Just an update for you all. Pulled the trigger on an EOS today from Cargiant in North London. The right car at the right price but not too happy with the colour (very dark blue) but I'm happy to compromise.

Traded in my 2002 A6. Was bit worried as the turbo had gone, drivers window didn't work plus a few other little faults. They didn't even check anything and gave me Â£500 more than I had expected in a trade.

Drove VW home and have just got back. All good. Time for a glass of wine now though, been a long day.

Yeah pics. Engine, spec, price etc? If you don't mind. Eos is a nice looking car.
