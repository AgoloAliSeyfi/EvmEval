Peter Schiff went down to OWS to have a chat with the self declared "99%" and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_20892&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=vZr9c1zYaOE&amp;v=UGL-Ex1CD1c">this is the result</a> The ensuing "dialogue" was entirely predictable as unlike Schiff many of the protesters havn't done their economic homework. They just see; people in suits = greed = ruined economy, whereas he's trying to tease out the good part of capitalism from the bad.

Schiff is a hero, bailing out failing businesses is not capitalism.

As for the foolish man who happened to be black at the start, moaning about how a businessman should recieve half-profits to create jobs which don't need to exist pfft, if that's the way things work why bother? Such a way of doing things is just not sustainable.

That's a nice video. The protesters were not being made to look stupid.

I think the first guy has a point, there is wanting something good for yourself and there is greed. The £50m and £100m example, with either of those you are living a very very nice life. Its greedy to look at what you have and then justify giving yourself the other £50m when you have workers barely making end meet, or in some cases you are still laying off staff. I'm happy to see capitalism in the market in general, but its not a healthy thing to have dictating society in general. On a smaller scale, I think companies should show more loyalty to workers, and a more even approach to the way pay/benefits is distributed in the workforce.

The pay gap between those those on the front line of business and those at the top is too large. There is increased responsibility and experience required at the top and they should be paid more, but there is no justification for paying someone at the top of a business a huge salary and then on top of that bonus worth millions when the company hasn't performed well, there have been serious failings on the part of the people at the top and the direction of the company, and then to freeze pay, give no bonus to normal workers, who may have performed exceptionally but with the wrong targets and instructions from the top, and in some cases cut jobs.

The gap is far too large and is increasing at a rate there is no justification other than greed. In many ways I don't think this is pure capitalism, this change in boardroom pay isn't dictated by the market, its dictated by people within the business wanting a larger slice of profits. To get those profits year in year out, they are pushing workers harder and harder, cutting pensions, cutting benefits, effective pay cuts, all to generate a profit that isn't being used for the good of the business, just a very small group of workers.

I do think the Occupy/99% thing is about far more than just Wall Street, its about the failings of society and many people''s gripes should really lie with the gov rather than an employee on wall street.
