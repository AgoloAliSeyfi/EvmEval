It is not that the tax exists, it is what is done with what is levied, it is about consent, it is about acting responsibly with a trust. What is Governments primary function again Citizen??? What are It's Powers? What are the Limits to those Powers? What is it's obligation in relation to transparency? Disclosure? Rule Of Law? Should the Government account for what it takes? for what it spends? For Hypocrisy?

What is the governments primary function?

Well one of the first acts of the new american govt was to levy the whiskey tax which must be paid in specie at a time when much of frontier america existed primarially on barter.
Washington led a group group of soldiers larger than at any revoloutionary war battle into western PA to enforce the collection of the tax.

Think about it.

That was a Hamilton Scheme of unfair Taxation designed to benefit larger manufacturers and shut down Independents. Hamilton also ran Bond scams, where he misrepresented the value of the bonds convincing many to sell for pennies on the dollar. Is this the kind of leadership you want? May I suggest a Good read?... Well I will anyway. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/wink.gif"/> "Reclaiming The American Revolution".

So I take it you do not live in a state or community that has an income or payroll tax?
Many communities have a payroll tax for the priveledge of working in their community whether you live in the community or not.

so the state taxes you on your income and then again with a sales tax when you spend it.

And guess how many businesses choose to invest capital in buildings, infrastructure and such in those communities.
We run like a bat out of hell when a municipality initiates taxes like that.
Lower taxes means businesses are going there.

</quote>

Ohh they give the businesses all kinds of tax free incentives even loans that do not have to be repaid to locate there.
And then collect the payroll tax off of the workers. The businesses do not pay the payroll tax the workers do.

all income is taxed multiple times. every time it changes hands it is taxed again. your taxed on your income, then again on the sales, then again on property, then again and again. its the same as you winning the lottery, its free money to the person who receives it. an estate also doesnt necessarily have to be passed on to a family member. should your neighbor or friend get it tax free as well? whats the difference there?

Not by the same entity. Yes, I pay federal and state taxes on each pay check. When I go to the grocery store with the money I earned that the government actually allows me to keep, I pay a LOCAL sales tax. My property taxes are to the COUNTY. Now, if I were being taxed on my income by the feds and then paying a federal tax at the gorcery store, you might have an argument. The federal government already got a piece of the action each time I get paid. If I choose to give money to my son, they are not entitled to retax what they already taxed.

You didn't pay attention to what I said. I live in Oklahoma and we have a STATE income tax. When I buy groceries, I pay LOCAL (CITY) taxes. My property taxes are a COUNTY tax. The state gets theirs off the top out of my income. The city and the city alone gets a cut when I buy someting in a store. The state doesn't get a piece of that action. They already got theirs when they taxed my income.

It's not your money anymore when you die. In fact the royal "You" ain't anymore after you die. Your wealth is transferred elsewhere. And when wealth is transferred, Uncle Sam gets his cut.

where does it say that, exactly? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_eh.gif"/>

Define "It."

The authority to tax flows from the constitution, Article 1 section 8. Corresponding law specific to the estate tax can be found in the federal register.

If you're asking where 'it' says that when you die, it's not your money anymore... I'm not sure how to answer that. I'm not sure 'it' says it anywhere; that's just the way it is. A dead man doesn't own anything.

That's right.........because upon his death he bequeathed it to his family. Where in the constitution does it say that when you die, the government is entitled to your wealth? If you had no living relatives and you had no will directing a charity or something to leave your wealth to, I could see the government taking it. But if you direct for your wealth to remain within your family, there is no logical reason for the government to demand a piece of it other than they can take it by force.
