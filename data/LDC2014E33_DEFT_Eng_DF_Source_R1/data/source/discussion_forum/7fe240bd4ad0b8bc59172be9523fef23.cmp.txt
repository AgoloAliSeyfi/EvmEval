Once again you fucking MORON I have the meetings from the Japanese Government. They were never going to surrender to the allies before the A bombs and there were no deals to surrender to the Soviets as the Japanese did not believe they would attack them.

Have you never realized the Potsdam Declaration was designed to inhibit Japan's surrender so the a-bombs could be used?

No wonder you are such an idiot: Poor, poor Curvey believes
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Elmer_Barnes">Harry Elmer Barnes</a> whose career as a professor and then as a journalist was aborted by his contentiousness and his cavalier disregard not only for accuracy but also for truth. He produced no original scholarly work but synthesized information from his vast reading in a series of prolix and repetitious works on the history of Western civilization.

I never referenced barnes as a source you lying fuck.

So the documents relied on by CurveLight are suspect, Samson? I have to admit, I hope that you and RetiredGySgt and namvet are right, and Quartermass and CurveLight are wrong.

This country has enough to feel shame over without a gratitutous A-Bombing or two to add to that black list.

Curvey's only resource is some nut-case-historical-revisionist.

Please check your InBox. I'm grateful to you, and so you have a present.

So you're relying on Samson to tell you my sources instead of asking me? How much sense does that make? One source is an article from August 1945:

"In an article that finally appeared August 19, 1945, on the front pages of the Chicago Tribune and the Washington Times-Herald, Trohan revealed that on January 20, 1945, two days prior to his departure for the Yalta meeting with Stalin and Churchill, President Roosevelt received a 40-page memorandum from General Douglas MacArthur outlining five separate surrender overtures from high-level Japanese officials. (The complete text of Trohan's article is in the Winter 1985-86 Journal, pp. 508-512.)"

Samson claimed my "only resource" is barnes when in fact I've never referenced barnes at all. So you just thanked Samson for outright lying.

Madeline, have you ever responded to the fact our top military leaders all agreed the bombs were not necessary?

You're one of many who lack basic knowledge about the end of WW2. The bombs were used to prevent Japan from surrendering through a deal with Russia. Why? The US would have had to share the spoils of war and we were not about to do that. Also, we were never really allies with Russia as our only common goal was defeating the third Reich in Europe.

But feel free to continue calling people an idiot because they say something beyond your comprehension capabilities. It makes you look oh so cool!

Curvelight's "source" is Mark Weber's IHR Article.

Let's see what Good Ol' Mark is all about, shall we?

<quote>
Mark Weber:
<a href="http://www.adl.org/holocaust/weber.asp">The Professional Denier</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

More than any other propagandist, Mark Weber, 45, embodies the Holocaust-denial movement. An articulate, media-savvy spokesperson with a master's degree in History from Indiana University, Weber got his start in the radical right in 1978, when he took the position of news editor for National Vanguard, a publication of the neo-Nazi National Alliance. In 1979, Weber also began to contribute regularly to The Spotlight, a weekly

tabloid produced by Willis Carto's Liberty Lobby organization. His involvement with the IHR also intensified steadily over the years; initially working as a contributor to the now-defunct IHR Newsletter, Weber began serving as emcee for the group's annual conventions in 1984. In 1985 he became a member of IHR's Editorial Advisory Committee and in 1992 he became editor of the Journal of Historical Review. Following IHR's break with Carto and the subsequent departure of most professional staff members in 1993, Weber became director of the organization with one professional staff person serving under him.

Ahh, yes.

Only those as hopelessly stupid as Curvey would use Weber as a resource. Maybe he has a National Enquirer Article he'd like to present with more credability? Perhaps some Alien in the form of Elvis has an opinion about Ethics and The A-Bomb that Curvey would like to share!! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>
