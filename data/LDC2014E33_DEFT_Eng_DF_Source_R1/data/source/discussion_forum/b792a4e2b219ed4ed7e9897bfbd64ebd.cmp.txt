Socialists/Progressives like to have it both ways on issues like this. They don't really want the Government out of the bedroom. They only want that when it's convenient for them. They fully support the Government forcing Taxpayers to subsidize fellow Citizens' personal sexual behavior. They also fully support forcing Taxpayers to subsidize Abortions. So they're not very honest or consistent. It's time for Big Government to really get out of the bedroom. Let the age of personal responsibility dawn.

No, they dont, because they know its illegal to use taxpayers funds to subsidize abortion. So liberals dont want to have it both ways, theyre being perfectly honest and consistent.

If conservatives really want Big Government out of the bedroom and an age of personal responsibility to dawn, then they need to cease their efforts to violate a womans right to privacy with regard to abortion and access to contraceptives.

The hypocrisy and ignorance belongs to conservatives alone.

Unless of course one is dealing with conservatives who oppose abortion for women in cases of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother; in addition to being ignorant hypocrites, such conservatives are also criminals.

These are private personal matters. They are not Government matters. The Government should not be involved with these issues at all. Have all the Contraceptives &amp; Abortions you want, just don't demand fellow Citizens pay for it. Your personal sexual behavior is your business &amp; responsibility. Fellow Citizens/Taxpayers are not responsible for subsidizing your personal sexual behavior. The Government needs to get out of the bedroom once and for all.

read my several posts on how health insurance actually works and realize that you already pay for other peoples services. and you raising issues with your health care provider already? making sure that none of your premiums dollars are going towards services you disagree with?

Not a Government issue. The Government should not force anyone to pay for someone else's personal sexual behavior. Have all the Contraception &amp; Abortions you want, but pay for it yourself. The Government shouldn't be involved with these issues.

since the government is not providing services, your argument is invalid. and im glad to see you skipped over the rest of my argument on how insurance works in general. so i assume you are ok with paying your premiums to your health insurance company knowing that they provide abortions?

Some things i just can't control. I don't like Abortion but if Health Insurance covers it, than so be it. But the Government shouldn't be involved with issues like this. Contraception and Abortion are private personal matters.
