WTF? This guy is really, really obsessed with the names thing.

Most of the wingnuts here pick something a bit less... trivial... for their Ahab-like obsessions. For Peanut it's labor unions, for Fester it's Islam, for Carol it was... uh... an Illuminati-like conspiracy involving public health doctors, the Ivy League, unitarians, Nazis, Bolsheviks, and obscure 19th century American philanthropists. For "Meade" it's people who use pseudonyms on the Internet.

To be fair, it's only for people he doesn't like. bdog is a good dog, so he gets told he's likeable.

I thought it was obvious. But I will spell it out for you. Walker would get the Koch Bros. to pay to have them grafted on and then trade them.

LUKPAC, and all other Progs, bumping and simplifying the question:

It was the right call for Prosser to resign in the midst of an investigation before all the facts were in?

But standing by Ald. Solomon case after the facts are in and the prosecutor says he is a victimizer is also justified?

A group of Madison City Council and Dane County Board members want Ald. Brian Solomon to resign over allegations he sexually harassed and assaulted an assistant city clerk.

In a two-page letter, released to the State Journal Wednesday night, six City Council and two County Board members said they believe Solomon acted inappropriately, abused his position, broke the law, showed no remorse and should resign immediately.
[...]
“This is not OK. It’s not OK for an elected official to get away with this,” said Ald. Lisa Subeck, 1st District, who organized the letter seeking Solomon’s resignation. “We have a responsibility to hold ourselves to high professional standards. Brian did not hold himself to high ethical standards or hold himself to standards of professionalism. The only way to resolve that is for him to step aside and resign. The integrity of the (council) is at stake.”

The move would show city staff and citizens that harassment and assault, especially by an elected official, aren’t tolerated, Subeck said.

Alds. Bridget Maniaci, Chris Schmidt, Tim Bruer, Steve King and Mark Clear also signed the letter, along with county Sups. Analiese Eicher and Carousel Bayrd, who lives in Solomon’s district.

However, there are only two reasons this lives on and both are a result of council actions: the decision to pursue a code of conduct and the crafting of the resignation request letter.

Brian, there's a 3rd reason. Even if the rape accusations are false, the eyewitness testimonies prove you're a scumball.

From the letter asking him to resign:

<quote>
We find your actions highly disconcerting. Here are three examples highlighting our concerns:

1. On the night of the alleged assault, you followed Ms. Berg into the women’s bathroom at a local bar and only left after one of your colleagues asked you to. You deny this happened, despite eyewitness accounts from neutral parties.

2. You admit to having to carry Ms. Berg part of the way from the bar to her car at the end of the night because she was too drunk to walk. Yet, you insist that she was not intoxicated two hours later when you arrived at her home where the alleged assault took place. The Department of Justice disagrees that Ms. Berg was sober at the time of the alleged assault. Given her behavior and her physical stature, it is not reasonable to claim that she would have become sober within 2 hours.

3. You sent Ms. Berg harassing emails while she was sitting across from you working for the city during a city council meeting. Ms. Berg ignored your emailed advances, but you continued by commenting on her looks and asking her what she was doing after work.

You have not expressed any remorse.

Based on this, Solomon is a scumball, IMHO.
