Man,what a country. The Media is now cheerleading and celebrating the fact more Americans are shopping for the Holidays this year. My question is...How can this be? More Americans are living in Poverty than ever before and Unemployment is the highest it has been in many years. More Americans are also now receiving Food Stamps than ever before yet they're all out shopping? Something is definitely wrong with this picture. Is the Media telling us the truth or are they just Bullshitting us again? How can so many Americans be suffering and shopping at the same time? The numbers just don't seem to be adding up. And is 'Shop till you Drop' really the right message to be sending Americans at this point? Just something i've been wondering about. All this suffering yet the people still shop till they drop? Hmm? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/confused.gif"/>

The National Retail Federation predicts spending this holiday season will reach $451.5 billion, up 3.3 percent over last year.

That would be the biggest increase since 2006, and the largest total since a record $452.8 billion in 2007. The holiday season runs from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31, so a strong week after Christmas could still make this the biggest of all time. Spending numbers through Dec. 24 won't be available until next week and final numbers, through Dec. 31, arrive next month.

Sales will be marginally up from last year.

This is a good, but hardly great sign.

I don't think 'Shop till you Drop' proves your assertion. It proves something but i'm just not sure what. More Americans are receiving Food Stamps than ever before yet they're out there buying their Big Screen TVs and X-Boxes? Something is definitely wrong with this picture.

You really need to stop talking to yourself.

You pick out one obscure aspect of my post and go bezerk over it and ignore the rest.

Naw i'm talkin to you. Do you even know what a Christian is? Do you go to Church? Your 'Blame the Evil Christians" theory on over-spending is just plain simple. Seriously,i lost a whole lot of respect for you with that ridiculous theory. Your knowledge of what being a Christian is about is very limited at best. Try commenting on things you know. You obviously know nothing about Christians. Like i said,grow up and stop being a simpleton.

I was forced to attend chruch 3 times a week till I was 16 I do understand what Christianity is all about, I have read the bible thru a few times.

I do think real Chriatians are fine folks, but those "christians" who use religion for their own ends are despicable.

I pretty much support the food bank at my local church, and when I die they insist on having my funeral there although I tried to talk them out of it and they know I am a non believer.
I also contribute to youth programs and such at the local church.

My entire family are Christians besides me. I just do not believe in any all powerful supreme being nor heaven nor hell. I believe this life is all we have and many "christians" screw that up and promise better in the next life if you do as they say.
One issue is do what which "they" say?

And I have nothing but disgust for the god bless my bomb types.
Jesus would never condone killing or war.
I do believe Jesus was a great humanitarian, but son of god? No.
He did do his best to bring love and kindness to the Jewish religion though.
Jesus also seemed to refuse to involve himself in politics.

Your 'Blame the Evil Christians" theory on over-spending is still just silly Bullshit. Seriously,you need to grow up and stop being so simple. I don't care what your past experiences with Christianity were. That doesn't mean you know anything about Christians. Try actually talking to some Christians and maybe even attending Church once and awhile. Your warped 'Blame the Evil Christians for Everything' theory' is just so tired &amp; petty. Try getting to know some Christians. They're hardly the evil snarling beasts you make them out to be.

I'm sorry you've had bad experiences with Christianity. I really am. But you really need to get over your pettiness and bitterness. Your knowledge of and experience with Christians is obviously very limited yet you act as if you're some kind of expert. I assure you the "Evil Christians" are not responsible for everything wrong in your World. Maybe you're the one who has the problem? Maybe you should think about that a bit more? It could be just you. Anyway,have a Merry Christmas. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>
