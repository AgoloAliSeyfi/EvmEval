I am a conservative Republican who is going to vote for Obama this election.

And no, he hasn't done Jack for the country and I am totally at odds with his liberal socialist agenda.

So why would I vote for him and encourage others to pull the lever for Obama?

Because after he wins the election he can tell AIPAC to stuff it.

Then I believe he will be the first setting American to read the riot act to Israel and it's fascist government.

Not having to worry about re-election will allow Obama the freedom to throw off the Zionist slave chains that are wrapped around the presidency.

Placing America first; and Israel a far distance second.

Obama taking this patriotic stance is far more important for our nation's security and safety than any other single issue or threat we face as a freedom loving people.

Voting for a man with so much muslm blood on his hands, sad.

But I agree with GHook, the "Obama hates Israel and jews" blather is brought to us by the Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson type of republicans. The ones who only debate with emotion and hysterics and aren't trying to make a point, just trying to get attention and the "wow" factor.

Debt, deficits, Obamacare, garbage economy, plenty of legitimate reasons to hate Obama. No need to drum up emotional diatribe.

Blaming him for debt,deficits or the economy is as bad.

I know I know, Bush forced him not to make any spending cuts in order to pay for the war and he was powerless to keep the debt from increasing.

Also when Obama takes a crap, Otis Spunkmeyer cookies come out. True story.

Don't be silly now! and thanks for that image. He did make spending cuts. But you don't cut off your nose to spite your face. I am nore critical of him not protecting Americans fron vulture captialism(although a lot of legislation has been blocked), signing parts of the unPatriot Act and signing NDAA.

I'm talking about cuts to the overall budget, we know he'll never do that, regardless of how much it'll skyrocket debt and cost our kids and grandkids. (don't worry, I know reps will spend us into oblivion also)

and yes I'm glad you're critical of him for those things, a sincere kudos to you. Most Obama supporters just ignore them.

I'm not sure you can call me an Obama supporter. There are a few Repubicans I would vote for over Obama. Of course the only one left is Ron Paul, maybe Mittens.

I don't see this as an issue worthy of such hysteria.

1. I haven't seen any Obama hates Israel threads in months.

2. As a regular Fox viewer I haven't seen it there in recent months either.

In fact I haven't seen it much at all since Obama made the ridiculous border statements.
