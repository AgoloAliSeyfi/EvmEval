It seems appropriate to describe many governments in this may - particulularly in Europe, primarily caused by the shambles that is the EU

Have a worse deficit or worse debt?
Is that per person or as a percentage of GDP?
Does that include all of the off balance sheet debt that we have (but the US doesn't)?

Typical LGS, making 2 + 2 =5 !
The banking sector didn't borrow the money, the governments did!

What would you say his successes and failures were?

So wait a minute, you are now saying that the bank bailouts will actually make money?

I thought previously you were claiming that bailing out the banks was the reason for all the debt and we would be paying for their mistakes for years?

So maybe the lending wasn't so reckless after all........

And your solution to the current problem??

Borrow more money!!!

Surely more robots equals less jobs for people?

he banks wasted trillions and brought western economies to their knees through incompetence and greed.Hithertoo economies which ran surpluses were reduced to massive deficits because of them.

What would you say his successes and failures were?

<quote>
failures = allowing the housing market to go unchecked (understandable because of the huge revenue being generated)
Following Thatcherite principles by maintaining a light touch where the city activities were concerned.
Not being honest with the public and telling us all that tax and spen is better than borrowing to spend( again understandable as it would have meant political suicide)
Successes- low inflation, low interest rates low unemployment,minimum wage,much needed investment in public services. BoE independence in setting rates
With reference to "he should have saved money when we had a surplus". If he had done so there would have been complaints about hoarding money and not cutting taxes for the "wealth creators"

<quote>
I think eventually they will, but probably not for some time.The bail out was masterstroke without which the world economies would have been plunged into the worst recession in living memory

my solution is to kick start the economy through a mix of private and public enterprise, getting back to manufacturing as we once did, but concentrating on the high tech sector.Much of the work would have to be done by robots in order to be competitive.This would mean job sharing and working less hours but at a much higher hourly rate so everyone gets a fair share.20 hour weeks could become the norm before long.Either that or we shall have to put up with eternal high unemployment and stop bellyaching about paying for it
