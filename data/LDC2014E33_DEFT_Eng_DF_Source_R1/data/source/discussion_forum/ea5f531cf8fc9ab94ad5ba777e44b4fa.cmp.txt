If they pulled it because they didn't like the subject matter of the show, that's kind of wrong. I mean, this is the network that gave us the Jon and Kate and the shows about the midgets, which is a lot more obnoxious than a show about Muslims.

If they pulled the ads because no one was watching the show, then it's a sensible business decision.

As far as I can tell, ratings had nothing to do with it. It was centered solely on the fact that the subject matter was Muslims and they were getting a lot of feedback with strong opinions on the subject matter. Go figure.

As I said, it was a dumb move on their part as no one would have ever found out about the ads other than those that watch the show. They obviously do not care about the controversy. Now many people are pissed. Not sure if I care at all myself but I did want to see some opinions/discussions of the people here. Many are calling it a racist move but I don't think that a company of that scope makes decisions on this scale with a racist intent. They have far too much money on the line. It seems they did not think it through though.

What part of this are you having trouble understanding?

"Lowe's has received a significant amount of communication on this program, from every perspective possible. Individuals and groups have strong political and societal views on this topic, and this program became a lightning rod for many of those views. As a result we did pull our advertising on this program," the company said in a statement Saturday.

? None.
Where have I stated anything that would lead you to believe I do not understand their statement?

The show is just propiganda. They want to show us how Muslims are misunderstood victims.

Next time i need to shop for some tools, fuck home depot, i'm going to lowes.

</quote>

IMO, Lowes is way better anyways, I appreciate their position but they have what I need all the time unlike Home Depot...

</quote>

Sometimes they both suck...lol.

I needed a spotlight fixture for my Christmas lights (just the holder on a spike). Lowes was out. Home Depot was out. Sears was out. Target was out. K-Mart was out. The little mom &amp; pop True Value a block from my house that I never shop at had about a hundred in stock. Sure, they were $3.00 more than the others would have been... but they HAD them.

I don't have a Lowe's near me but Home Depot does suck. I went in to buy some half inch by six lag bolts and they had none, I mean none at all.

Those lags are one of the staples of construction and are required by code and there were none.

I went in yesterday and they were out of 15 amp circuit breakers.

I am hoping a Lowe's will be built nearby.

It appears Kayak.com also pulled their ads, but they cited the poor quality of the show.

There's an "All American Muslim" show? I didn't know that.

I'm German - how about an "All American Kraut" series for us?

</quote>

Great point. Especially since being a Muslim is a nationality just like being German.
