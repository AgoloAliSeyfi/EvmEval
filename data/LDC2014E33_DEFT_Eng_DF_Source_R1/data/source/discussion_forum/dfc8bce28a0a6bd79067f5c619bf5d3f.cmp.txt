For one thing, what's poor. To the billionaire, the mere millionaire is very poor. The poor in this country is beyond the wildest dreams wealthy of the poor in most of the world.

My step granddaughter is poor. She lives below the poverty line. Or does she? She is a single mother with four children from four different anonymous men. She lives in Section 8 housing, a nice three bedroom two bath apartment. Her utilities are all subsidized. She had benefit provided telephone service and a benefit provided cell phone. Her childen eat all three meals a day at school, but she still has a loaded EBT card. In addition, there are food banks and food pantries where she doesn't have to pay at all. My step granddaughter doesn't drive. When she wants to go someplace she has generously been provided a transit card to take the bus. If the bus doesn't go where she wants to go she can call for a car. There are a number of public benefit provided access cars. It would be unfair to say she doesn't work. She provides child care to her friend's three children. She gets a check every month for that. Her friend gets paid for providing child care to my step granddaughter's children. She gets her welfare check every month. She has never had to buy her children Christmas presents. They get dozens from any number of holiday giveaway programs. Two of her children have been diagnosed as having some form of hyper activity disorder. They get SSI.

All in all, her take home is in excess of $5,000 a month. She can afford to get her hair and nails done regularly. She can afford to pay for her medical marijuana which she needs for generalized stress. Getting this kind of medical care as a public benefit is something she is vitally interested in. She isn't rich, but she certainly is quite comfortable.

It wasn't always like this. She was going to join the Coast Guard and get job training. At one time she was considering culinary school and become a chef. She had dreams at one time but all that was leached away because being poor was just so easy and so comfortable.

This sounds like someone who has learned how to game the system, and that is unfortunate. I'm sure there are a few people like that.

And there are people who are working poor taking some of these benefits to survive.

I do think that at least part of the problem is that the government makes it too easy to get benefits and doesn't do anything to hold people to account. What sounds devastating here is that there are four kids involved who are going to think that this is all perfectly normal and okay.

I would have no problem with a work requirement for welfare. And drug testing, which liberals scream bloody murder about if anyone suggests it.

I think he was talking about those on welfare that choose to sit on there asses on welfare and do not even bother to look for work. Not the poor who look for work and are just having a hard time finding it.
I'll answer the question, those who choose to sit on their asses and not help themselves do not deserve the help of others. Those that at least try to find work and do better for themselves deserve our help to get them on their feet.

If you listen to his whole quote instead of just being a left wing prick here and I'm no Romney fan, Mitt was explaining how the poor had a safety net built in and the rich shouldn't worry but he was really concerned in this day and age the the middle class was losing everything they had gained slowly over all these decades.

But hey you want to lie because that's the drum beat over this or to remain ignorant of the truth.

Odds are if you are a Democrat you are just a blatant liar.

wasnt talking about what Romney said.....was talking about what the Rabbi said..........
