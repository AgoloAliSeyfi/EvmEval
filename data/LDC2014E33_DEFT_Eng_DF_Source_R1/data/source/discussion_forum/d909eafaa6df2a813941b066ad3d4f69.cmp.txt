No you're not right, you say every time money changes hands it gets taxed, but you fail to recognize that money earned and that has been taxed will be taxed a second time upon death per the estate tax. Your comparing money that has been earned, taxed, spent thus being earned by another party, taxed and spent again etc etc... not the same as the estate tax at all.

You fail!

And THAT is the debate being had. The 35% on amounts over $5M is the compromise, and frankly, it's a compromise that's slanted incredibly far to the right. But it just ain't good enough is it? No no, we need *NO* estate tax at all.

Tough shit. We live in a society where everyone gets a voice, and this is the current policy. Chances are it will move more to the middle over time.

And stop worrying about it... Nobody believes you're worth $5M so give it up, man!

Earned wealth is neither liberal nor conservative.
It is the property of someone.
Inheritance has already been taxed. All inheritance should be tax free.
Transfer of wealth from a family that had earned it to one that has not is a way to fund government that spends too much $$.
If government would spend as much time looking for ways to slow the growth and cut spending of government as it does looking for ways to rob citizens at the point of a gun the budget would not be a problem.
But most conservatives are also liberals when it comes to cutting THEIR "entitlement" program. Hell no is their answer then.
