Either this is coming completely out of your own head, or you've got some kind of source that backs you up. All I have is personal experience, and it doesn't back you up at all. I'm only asking you show the evidence for your claim so I can evaluate it myself, as you seem to have done.&lt;snip&gt;

I don't really think I'm saying anything controversial, or even anything you disagree with. All I'm saying is that when thousands of children were being molested in the '60's, the public did not respond to it the way they can and will today.

It's my opinion that I fail to see how any adult couldn't do all in his power and beyond it if possible to try to stop ongoing pedophilia of which he was aware. I fail to see what he's got to be confused about. That he can somehow find some way to justify it to himself concerns me not in the least, nor does it garner my empathy or sympathy.

Describing a person's possible motives or thinking does not imply empathy or sympathy. I don't approve of Joe Paterno's failure to act.

They are relevant because they indicate that during the 1980s, the culture took the issue very seriously. The charges were nonsense, but they do not reduce the conclusion that the culture took the charges seriously. In fact, it was quite the opposite. The charges were taken so seriously because, even though the charges were nonsense, people were so outraged that they wanted to make them stick at any cost.

That event, therefore, gives the lie to @Mary_H's claim. Which is the point.

I would suggest that the '80's were when making a big deal out of sexual abuse finally became okay for some parts of the population. Obviously, though, even the '80's were too soon for the population of Happy Valley.

And again, you haven't provided anything to back this up.

You haven't shown it wasn't a code of silence as opposed to tacit acceptance.

You've not done anything but make declarations of fact with no evidence whatsoever.

What is the difference between a code of silence and tacit acceptance?

Do I really need evidence to establish that culture changes over fifty years?

In trying to refute my own claim, I looked for evidence of public sexual abuse scandals before the '80's. I haven't found anything yet, but I came across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_sex_abuse_cases">this interesting information in Wikipedia</a> :

Germany

Third Reich 1933Â–1945

During the Nazi era, false cases of sexual abuse were fabricated to malign the Catholic Church. The "immorality trials" (Sittlichkeitsprozesse) of Catholic priests in April and May 1937 are the prime examples of this phenomenon.[40] In these trials, innocent priests and members of religious orders became the target of accusations of luring children and youth into sexual acts. Staged trials of Franciscan friars held in 1936 did not receive the media attention the National Socialist regime hoped for; and this was not the only problem. In a case that would eventually be dismissed as baseless the alleged victim, when asked at trial if the offender was in the courtroom, pointed to the president of the court.[41] Hence, in order to show that the "offences against morality" were a massive problem within the Catholic Church, the regime ordered that individual cases should be accumulated at a more opportune moment. A large number of cases were brought to trial in the spring of 1937. Stefan Micheler writes:

Over the course of eight weeks between April and June, the daily and party newspapers and radio devoted extensive, front-page coverage to the trials... The coverage focused on the seduction of children and youth, the exploitation of relationships of dependence, and the abuse of rank and office. The press ignored cases where investigations were dropped or trials resulted in acquittals due to lack of evidence or ill-founded accusations.[42]

In a speech at Berlin's Deutschlandhalle on May 30, 1937, Joseph Goebbels stated in front of 25,000 people that the "criminal aberrations of the Catholic clergy threaten the physical and moral health of our young people." He declared that the "plague" would be "radically extirpated." The speech was spurred on by the crowd's repeated cries of "Hang them! Massacre them!"[41] Florence Tamagne writes: "The anti-Catholic campaign continued until 1941. By 1936, all the Catholic youth organizations had been closed down." However, she also notes that, of approximately 20,000 German priests, "only 57 were convicted; of 4,000 members of the regular clergy, only 7 were convicted. Lastly, of 3,000 lay brothers, 170 were convicted, mostly Franciscans."[41] According to reports published by SoPaDe, the propaganda nature of the trials was widely recognized by both Catholics and Protestants. Nevertheless, as a result of the trials, children and youth would often avoid socializing with Catholic priests.[42]

That's a given.
BUT. You need to provide evidence that a specific aspect has changed.
My recollection is that it hasn't, at least in regard to adults and actual children (sub-15 year olds).
