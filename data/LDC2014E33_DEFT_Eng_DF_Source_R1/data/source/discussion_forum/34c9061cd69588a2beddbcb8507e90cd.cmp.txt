he wished that what he perceived as obama's socialist agenda would fail....wishing someone dead for their opinion is a bit much......

It doesn't matter how many times you show the brainwashed Ditto-Dopers actual quotes of LimpBoy saying he hopes Americans are in PAIN from the loss of their jobs and the PROLONGING of the Bush Depression so he can in "EUPHORIA" watch the suffering of the American people, they still parrot their programming that LimpBoy was talking about "policy" rather than SPITE.

RUSH: I want this whole plan to bomb out. And the only way this plan will bomb out is if it causes the pain that we know it's going to cause

Another typical liberal response. "I'm too bitter to get a joke (when it comes from the right)" <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_whistle.gif"/>

Another typical CON$ervative non-response. "I can't deny LimpBoy wants Americans to suffer until they LEARN the hard way to agree with his Ideology, so I call it a joke."

She wished his kidneys would fail... he wished our entire country would fail. I'm seeing a lesser of two evils here and I didn't even find her joke to be funny.

Are you really one of those insincere people who just repeat whatever they hear someone say or are you just stupid? Rush didn't say he wished the country would fail.

Stop being an idiot if it is possible for you.

It's just so simple.. all he had to do was refrain from laughing at the death wish of a talk show host.. not complicated at all. he is supposed to represent us.. all of us, not just the left not just hollywood,, all of us.. and therefore is expected to act with dignity. wasssup..

If LimpBoy was not wishing the country would fail when he said he wants Americans to lose their jobs and he hopes the Bush Depression is prolonged, then Sykes was NOT wishing for Limpboy's DEATH when she hoped his kidneys fail.

When Your Kidneys Fail

Healthy kidneys clean your blood by removing excess fluid, minerals, and wastes. They also make hormones that keep your bones strong and your blood healthy. When your kidneys fail, harmful wastes build up in your body, your blood pressure may rise, and your body may retain excess fluid and not make enough red blood cells. When this happens, you need treatment to replace the work of your failed kidneys.
