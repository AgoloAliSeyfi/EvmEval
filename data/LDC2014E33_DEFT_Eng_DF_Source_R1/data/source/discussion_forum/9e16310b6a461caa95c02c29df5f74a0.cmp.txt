I have been searching for sometime now, and I can't seem to find a dropshipper that sales merchandise low enough so I could profit from it. Would someone please help me?

Hi,

Nobody is going to give you their sources.

You are going to have to find them on your own.

There are plenty out there but most of them are more trouble than they are worth.

There are also a very few that are good suppliers but you have to realize, when dropshipping, the profit margin is VERY thin and you have to be on top of them all the time, monitoring their inventory.

People find a dropshipper, sign up and then list, list, and list! They list soooo much but then when it comes to monitoring the inventory they do not check back into the site to see if the inventory is still available.

You CAN have a successful business with dropshippers but it is W*O*R*K.

It is not E*A*S*Y.

I found all my sources by surfing the net on my cellphone during commercials, while waiting in line, any spare moment.

Search several different ways, most do not even have the word "dropship" on their site.

Good Luck.

LOL - Where did all the regulars go? Getting tired of answering this question in particular? What bad service you guys provide!

If someone was smart, they would create a word document with a response to the overly beaten questions regarding:

- Dropshippers (pros/cons)
- Product Sourcing
- FVF on Shipping
- High Fees
- PayPal Holds
- Etc..

Or, as mentioned before Ebay should PIN the repetitive questions to the top as it will be easy for newcomers to read... One day it will happen... **Keeping my fingers crossed**

And beware of "membership clubs" such as Doba and the like. They are not your solution. Real distributors do not charge you for taking your money.

Still, making any drop shipping work in the DSR-feedback-oriented quick ship ebay world will be a challenge.

Please do a quick search and you will find tons of info on drop shipping...here is a thread from the recent past

<a href="http://forums.ebay.com/db1/topic/Building-An-Ebay/Using-A-Drop/5200052702?#msg5200760329">http://forums.ebay.com/db1/topic/Building-An-Ebay/Using-A-Drop/5200052702?#msg5200760329</a>

which is only of about 25+ since the beginning of the year. I am sorry but until eBay pins the drop shipping topic all you can do is search older posts.

From what I've read, I'm not too sure that "good" and "dropshipper" can be used in the same sentence.

Not the way these people are doing it! Begging for leads.

My partners and I refuse to use dropshipping. If a dropshipper has 100 items for example and we sell 107 to 107 different people then we have 7 potential unhappy customers with the potential for 7 negative feedbacks. A dropshipper is only concerned with selling their 100 items as fast as they can. I am concerned with selling the 100 items that are in our inventory as best and correctly as possible. This is just my opinion.....
