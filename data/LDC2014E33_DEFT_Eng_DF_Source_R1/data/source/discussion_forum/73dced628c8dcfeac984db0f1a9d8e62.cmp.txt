'less help,' laying off maids, please. This is not a serious argument.

Not to you. But to others who don't have a job guaranteed for life, it is serious.

Now, I wonder what makes you think that I have a job guaranteed for life?

You failed to address the fact that your description of the way the market works is not reflected in, well, real life <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"/>

And you failed to explain why you think I was referring to 'maids' and not the employees of his business.

And what makes either of them less worthy of a job just because you want to raise taxes, in order to spend Other People's Money to make yourself look generous and compassionate.

Not that, sir; but to pay down some of our crushing deficit and debt.

Still amazing to me that you feel that cutting profits simply never will be an option.

Just as amazing to me that you never consider cutting federal spending as an option.

Don't stereotype so recklessly.

It will take both raised taxes AND cutting spending to get out of our financial hole. I support modernizing and making more efficient many gov't programs, and many that my fellow libs would disagree with me on.

And I'm of course willing to cut plenty of money from certain, extremely wasteful places: the Iraq war. The DoD. DHS. The Pentagon. Can't stray too far off the reservation.

I see that you are willing to cut constitutionally mandated functions like defense and security, while 'modernizing' functions that aren't constitutionally required (or even allowed if we take the 10th amendment seriously.)

Yeah you're solidly on the Liberal reservation. No need to worry about you straying.

How did Walmart become the largest retailer and gross the most money? Certainly not by raising prices and operating cost, and by providing lousy service. Perhaps government could learn something from this, but I doubt it. They are a monopoly and don't have to compete.
