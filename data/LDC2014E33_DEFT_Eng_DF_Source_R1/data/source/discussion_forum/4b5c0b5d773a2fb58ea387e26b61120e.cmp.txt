Many news sources repeated the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting statement by Ahmadinejad that "Israel must be wiped off the map",[5][6] an English idiom which means to "cause a place to stop existing",[7] or to "obliterate totally",[8] or "destroy completely".[9]

Ahmadinejad's phrase was "بايد از صفحه روزگار محو شود" according to the text published on the President's Office's website.[10]
The translation presented by the official Islamic Republic News Agency has been challenged by Arash Norouzi, who says the statement "wiped off the map" was never made and that Ahmadinejad did not refer to the nation or land mass of Israel, but to the "regime occupying Jerusalem". Norouzi translated the original Persian to English, with the result, "the Imam said this regime occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time."[11] Juan Cole, a University of Michigan Professor of Modern Middle East and South Asian History, agrees that Ahmadinejad's statement should be translated as, "the Imam said that this regime occupying Jerusalem (een rezhim-e eshghalgar-e qods) must [vanish from] the page of time (bayad az safheh-ye ruzgar mahv shavad).[12] According to Cole, "Ahmadinejad did not say he was going to 'wipe Israel off the map' because no such idiom exists in Persian." Instead, "he did say he hoped its regime, i.e., a Jewish-Zionist state occupying Jerusalem, would collapse."[13] The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) translated the phrase similarly, as "this regime" must be "eliminated from the pages of history."

But it's ironic that some on this forum call for the regime in Iran to be wiped out but we know you don't mean it to to blow Iran to bits, yet you take Ahmadinejad to mean something different from your own?

Ahmedinijad, according to none other than the Institute for Imam Khomeini, <a href="http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showpost.php?p=34888043&amp;postcount=30">certainly did call for Israel to be 'wiped off the map.'</a>

As <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2006/05/the_cole_report.single.html">Christopher Hitchens said</a> (I'd advise you to thoroughly read that article), and this also applies to you, "Professor Cole has completely missed or omitted the first reference in last October's speech, skipped to the second one, and flatly misunderstood the third. (The fourth one, about 'eliminating the occupying regime,' I would say speaks for itself.) He evidently thinks that by 'occupation,' Khomeini and Ahmadinejad were referring to the Israeli seizure of the West Bank and Gaza in 1967. But if this were true, it would not have been going on for 'more than fifty years' now, would it? The 50th anniversary of 1967 falls in 2017, which is a while off. What could be clearer than that 'occupation regime' is a direct reference to Israel itself? "

Your constant apologising for the fascist dictators in Iran is rather sickening.
