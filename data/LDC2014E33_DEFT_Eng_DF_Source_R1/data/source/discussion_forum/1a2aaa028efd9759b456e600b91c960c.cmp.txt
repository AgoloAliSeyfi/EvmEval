I have to admit I am really quite worried about Russia..

In the mainstream media and popular consciousness the big doomsday scenarios mainly centre around Iran and China, obviously both of those are grossly misrepresented, the idea of a US-Chinese war for example is objectively absurd and no serious commentators pay it any attention, it's really just a propaganda tool and an exciting subject for video games. The situation in Iran has the ability to cause a lot of misery in the middle east but again, Iranian leaders are really quite self aware, they know what they are doing, and there is near enough no risk to the world at large even if they do acquire nuclear weapons of them actually using them, although we as simple peasants obviously need to believe that and go along with our governments because if Iran does become a nuclear power then it will have a lot more independence and influence in the region and that obviously can't be tolerated.

Anyway, Russia, it seems to me, is the real potential doomsday scenario here. Almost all the conditions of wiemar Germany are present; economic downturn, unemployment, a recent history of loss of empire, rising nationalism and xenophobia. And just like Germany there is a hard turn to the far right by the country's middle classes and the rise of egomaniacal leaders who are already undermining what little democracy there has been in Russia. There are even Putin youth leagues harassing opponents above the law.

You have the ultra nationalist and deeply racist cossack tribes, highly militant, extremely aggressive and becoming more and more mobilised, convinced that the time has come for mother Russia and that x, y and z ethnic/religion/political groups are responsible for the loss of Russia's glory and therefore must be eliminated.

Just like Germany was, Russia still is a major military power, a nuclear one, and with enormous economic potential.

Honestly when you think about it it really does look just.. terrifying. Am I missing something here? Can anyone explain further or recommend some reading?

Eh? Neutral? They are rebuilding their spheres of influence in Eastern Europe, threatening a new arms build up along their borders and they are protecting dictatorships like Syria, their international policy is anything but neutral

"Neutral" to most people here will = not openly confrontational with the west.

EDIT: Also, getting pretty bored of this forum, say anything with any credibility and you get constant unexplained negs. Is this a playground for university aged conspiracy theorists to re-enact their Civilisation IV fantasies or is it a genuine discussion board?
