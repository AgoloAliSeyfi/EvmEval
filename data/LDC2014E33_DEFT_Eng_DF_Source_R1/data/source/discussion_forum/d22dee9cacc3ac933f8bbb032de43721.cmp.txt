So one thread wasnt enough? rdean has to make another one to blatantly lie?

Im hardly going to be accused of being a Paul fan, but he's right that the Federal Government has no authority to be involved in disaster aid. Apparently, rdean thinks that because he wont help them personally, no one else will.

Beautiful to see States stand up against the intrusion of the Federal Government.

Speaking about the governor of Ohio turning down funds to help people who have lost everything, even family members.

Gee, who said that you swine.

It is beautiful to see States stand up to the intrusion of the Federal government. It's not my fault you lack the integrity to acknowledge that there are other ways of providing aid. Nor my fault that you dont want to see real charity.

Avatar, the fact is there is no intrusion, it was stated that Federal involvement would complicate matters at this point.

You can't be serious. No relief for disaster victims is one of Paul's most popular spiels. Go to Youtube and do a search on "Ron Paul against FEMA". You can watch him rail against disaster relief till your heart's content.

How is it possible for you guys to have so little knowledge about your presidential candidates?

You seriously scare me.

Dean he admits in the story he bad mouths FEMA......so what else you got?....

Yeah, FEMA's Katrina effort was an epic performance. Upgrade that unit. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/>

FEMA under Bush was in itself a disaster. We all know that.

FACT is that FEMA and Homeland Security under Obama works very well.

LOOK IT UP.
