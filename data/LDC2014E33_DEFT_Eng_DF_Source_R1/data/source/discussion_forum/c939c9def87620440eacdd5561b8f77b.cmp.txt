the government didnt say you directly pay for other peoples health care idiot. the law says the health care providers can not change an extra co-pay or co-insurance for contraception. its not free, its simply included in the cost of your premium.

seeing as how you already pay for other peoples services, why are you not complaining about every other service your health care provider provides for no additional cost?

Again,

What does that have to do with the point that the government should not be forcing people to pay for other people's contraception or force insurance companies to provide coverage for contraception.

I don't have to have insurance, its still a choice.

How an insurance company uses the money from the premiums to pay for other people's health care is their business. If they want to charge extra for contraception coverage that is also also their business not the government's you arrogant prick.

Everybody who has insurance pays for other people's claims. The purpose of insurance is to spread the risk around. Some people will never have a claim. Others will have many claims.

Do you own a home? Think about how much your homeowner's insurance costs you. I had a patient in his 80s a couple weeks ago who has owned a home for 50 years. He said he figured up that over his lifetime he has paid $50,000 in premiums, but has never filed a claim. I haven't figured up mine because I've moved several times. Too much trouble. But mine right now is pretty high. I've only filed one claim and that was for a roof damaged by hail. $5,000. I've paid in much more. But the others who have lost everything have been covered because I have joined in and help, with my premiums, to spread the risk around.

That's how all insurance works. Med mal, health, car, you name it. The name of the game is spreading out the risk. If you never have a claim, you pay for everyone else's!

If I were an insurance company, I would pay for contraception. It would mean fewer dependents to cover.

Not true.

If you have insurance you are paying a third party to assume the risk for your claims. Most insurance companies use the money from premiums to pay claims, but that does not mean that the person paying the premium is actually paying the claim. There are insurance pools set up where people do pay for other people's claims, but they do that by sending payment directly to the person that needs the money, not to the doctor or hospital.

Well, if you were a a private insurance company you should have the choice to offer contraception coverage or not. Not be required to do so or not by the government.

As far as premiums paying for other people's claims, is it really relevant? I still have the choice to pay for insurance or not.

Another issue is the federal government is not even authorized to provide health care. If we want to do this the constitution must be amended (not that the Federal government even follows the constitution anyway) However, if the people of the individual states want to have their state government run their health care that's completely fine.

Just don't expect the people of the other states that don't want it to pay for it.
