dumbshit- who is threatening whom here?
Iran is completely encercled by the worlds hugest military machine.
If Iran had thousands of nuclear weapons stationed in Mexico, Canada and Cuba then yes, then you could say it would be a threat to the USA.

hey i'm with you here... i don't say the are a serious threat..
I meant they are threatening to destroy our ship with a missile

Those ships have a stronger fighting force than the entire Iranian military.
Dont you think if such Iranian aircraft carriers cruised in front of USA waters, the USA would NOT point their missiles against them and threaten them?

LOL just in time to start another war!! US troops are pulling out of Iraq and afghanistan, and just need another country to bomb for oil, remember all the WMDs you guys found in Iraq?? Or the guy who organized 9/11 living in a country next to the one you invaded? Iran has nuclear wepaons?? So does the US a lot more too, whats the difference?? Why is no one sanctioning the US?? You guys invade more countries than Iran ever thought of

The US thinks they are the world police. If it wasn't for oil we would not give a shit about the Middle East.

By buying Iranian oil Americans would see $2.50gl gasoline prices.. Your only screwing yourselves listening to the bigot politicians that control the world.

Could someone explain why Iran hasnt seen the uprising other arab stated have during the Spring. Why. Iranians are peaceful people... Irainains havent protested since 2009., Yet they kick the UK out the embassy... SPIES.

USA almost lost its top when Pakistan tested its nuke. Well the truth is. There is nothing in Pakistan we want. So they let that go. Sure Afghanistan is mineral rich, but its been destabilized to the stone age by Russia and the USA for no reason but to keep these countries from developing on their own. And of course the Poppy propaganda. The same war tactics used on Moonshiners in the USA.. Whats the purpose? SO the Big fish stays big and little guppies cant have shit. Nascar was Built on Illegal booze! Hypocrites.

These sanctions in place will not harm the Iranians intention to build nuclear weapons.. and if then Israel will no longer have the pushing power they do. It would take decades for Iran to develop enough arms to really threaten Israel and they never will anyways.

Refugees from Syria and Egypt are already seeking asylum in Israel
The threat of using a Nuke against Israel is preposterous. Fallout will come over the Nation that fires it IRAN,, Iraq wouldnt be to happy about it either. But its not like they are going to run up in Iran when the USA left them with a bicycles and bbguns, Iraq Military is fucked. They could put a nuke in the Straight of Hormuz and there would be no more passage.. It would only jeopardize Iran infrastructure more and land lock them.. But I think it would take a pretty damn big nuke to change the straight. And that they havent got..

Chinese President <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/topics/politics/president-hu-jintao.htm#r_src=ramp">Hu Jintao</a> as saying that he has ordered the Chinese Navy to prepare for war and that, in case of an attack on Iran, China will defend Iran...

Who sucks a better dick Ahmadinejad or Obama?.. I guess will have to wait and see.. <img src="images/newsmilies/3/set12_b/mickey.gif"/>

Getting back to sanctions. These are ridiculous Iranian people are jeopardized by this., not its government. And if they are putting money into its nuclear program. Then they are talking money out of something else. The majority of that from its public transportation and airlines.

In response to such the people are in more at risk when traveling in peace..

It must be nice to not have a conscious.. <img src="../images/newsmilies/dupe.gif"/>
