Emphasis mine - I didn't mean to imply that people in Paterno's generation actually give a lot of conscious thought to the victims or consider why they are reluctant to talk about sexual abuse. I can picture Paterno thinking "Geez, that poor kid" when he first heard about this, and then never considering the victim again.

Yeah, although I readily admit I of course don't know this to a certainty, that's my best guess to how this went down as well as far as Paterno's concerned.

There wasn't overt acceptance of this kind of stuff before but I think there was a kind of implicit acceptance. I grew up in the 70s and it wasn't so much that it was accepted but rather it just wasn't an issue one way or the other. The McMartin stuff, which was in the 80s, was the first I can remember even hearing about or thinking of the notion of child sexual abuse.

As bad as these scandals are (Catholic Church, PSU) I think in the long run they do broader good in the sense that they make the next scandal less likely to happen and they make people less likely to remain quiet when they hear something or something happens to them.

I think PSU was the perfect storm. There probably aren't many assistant coaches at top flight football schools that are child molesters but this one just happened to be at a school where the coach was a legend that had been there forever, and not just winning but running a "clean" program in the sense that historically mattered such as making your players go to class and not paying them money under the table. And yet since he (Paterno) was so old and society had changed so much, he wasn't up to speed on just how bad the actions were. And the guys running the school, who were more up on things, felt they had to defer to the legend Paterno and/or protect the program that had been built up for so long. You'd have a hard time writing something like this story.

I read a few times, and maybe one of them was earlier in this thread, that in 2005 or so the PSU President and Athletic Director when to Paterno's house to try to talk him into retiring and he turned them down. In normal times that may just give your football program some extra down years while it's being run by someone too old to be running it but in this case it happened to also be enabling a serial child molester.

Good post, #6, particularly the last bit.

I'm 50. There definitely was a sea change during the 1970s.

Still, putting this forth as if it were relevant to anything in the past 30 years is inane and just shows the power of the myth of Legendary Joe Paterno.

Not having known anything different, it's so weird to me that things used to be this way. That is, that child sex abuse was so often just swept under the rug. Particularly because people used to be so much more uptight about sex and how dangerous and corrupting it is. You'd think people who thought non procreative sex was so terrible and awful would be more concerned about child molestors and exposing them, not less.

Not as long as I have been alive (I'm 30). Maybe 50 years ago, though, I wouldn't know about that.

This did not happen 50 years ago. I do not understand your repeated attempts to rewrite history and make it seem like this is a societal development of the last 5 years, especially considering it requires you to completely ignore the absolute hysteria of the 80s over child sex abuse.

When I was a kid, just about every family sitcom had a "very special episode" in which one of the child characters found out a friend was being abused in some way, and then went and told a parent or teacher, who then contacted the authorities.

You're misreading me if you think I am trying to rewrite history or even trying to argue with anybody.

People in the Penn State system knew about Sandusky's proclivities for decades, but the case didn't get to the Grand Jury until 2009. 'Nuff said?
