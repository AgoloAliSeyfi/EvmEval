So is Dr. Oz right? Or is the FDA? Are there unsafe levels of arsenic in our apple juice? Or is this a ratings booster for the good doctor.

@Linkat,

back in the day, alchemists and other weird guys used to ingest arsenic to build up a tolerance against being poisoned by their friends.

they may actually be protecting us, strange as it may seem...

@Linkat,

Sure. Though I think a fresh apple is a better choice, given it is washed well.

I make a very real effort to consume nothing from China. The whole country is a toxic cesspool of pollution. You drive through the Chinese countryside and all you see is fields coated with coal dust from surrounding factories and people spitting on every surface to remove the black filth from their lungs. I think you can get perfectly good American apple juice and cider if you make a tiny effort. If we don't make an effort to buy our own apple products we will soon have no choice in the matter.

@Green Witch,

Actually I found it very difficult to find at least at the grocery store. I read through the entire label on one bottle (Motts) and could not find anything to indicate where the apple juice was from. Another was from about 5 different countries.

Unless you have the time to go to an apple orchard or something, I am not sure how to find. I spent 15 minutes or more reading through the various apple juice labels - and this was just apple juice so I can't imagine other stuff.

Although his particular study was not accurate - it does make you think - the particular concern is that China and other countries do not have the same rules in regard to pestides and that is the concern - how much and what is in these pestisides other countries are using.

@Green Witch,

I'm very much in agreement. I make a real effort not to bring any food stuffs into the house that are produced in China. There's a frozen veggie/fruit line called Europe's Best - labelling tells us "product of China".

Local fruits/veggies/cheese/meats as much as possible. It means a lot more time reading labels - if I can't figure it out, I don't buy it.

@Linkat,

Buy organic. It's extremely difficult for China to be certified organic because of their practices. Apples are one of the most heavily sprayed crops (even in the US), so it's better all around. You can also contact companies like Motts and tell them you will only buy their products if they use USA apples. There is a movement to get large corporations to go back to our apples and if there is a demand they will listen. China has taken over almost 80% of the apple market and if we don't stop they will soon have 100%.

luckily apple juice gives me heartburn, so i rarely drink it and if i do it's usually a locally or regionally pressed cider

@Linkat,

I'm not sure you can find the country of origin. I'm pretty sure that apples grown in China, and juiced in, say, Washington state could be labeled "Made in USA". On most manufactored products, the country doing the final assembly gets the label.

I think they could at least specify the varity of apple used. Most apple juice is too sweet to drink, to me anyway.
