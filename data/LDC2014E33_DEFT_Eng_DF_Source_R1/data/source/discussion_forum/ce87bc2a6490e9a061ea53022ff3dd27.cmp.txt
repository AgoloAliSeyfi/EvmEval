Edgarblythe already has heard this from me but I was in D.C. the summer of 63 and am somewhere in that crowd on the mall during the I have a dream speech.

One similar experience I had in D.C. was one night we were boarding a ship of dinner on the Potomac and a trip up the River to an amusment park (can't remember the name right this moment) any way we looked over and saw another boat loading but everyone one was black. We didn't get it until we discussed it on the plane trip back to San Diego. Then we started putting two and tow together. Sometimes for young people it take some time to understand in toto what is going on in front of you nose, so many other distractions in youth.

Edgar, Joanne - wish I could have been there, I was in thought and still am (if that makes sense)!

I was one of the 'Harvard Square 7' arrested out of God knows how many thousands of people at an anti-war rally that Jerry Rubin spoke at back in the early 70's. Turned into a massive riot. Walking the gauntlet up the steps of the police station in Cambridge was a piece of cake compared to the beating we took in the back room.

I got tear gassed but avoided getting beat up.

My Mom told me of an incident in Texas - before I was born, I suppose. Riding a bus on which there was just one vacant seat left, she observed a woman come on board and approach that seat. The young man occupying the window side moved to block her. "She's not sitting here" he said. Mom described how embarrassed she felt seeing the woman treated so, simply because of her skin color.

What? You didn't request a beating and they gave you one anyway? Sorry - Nothing funny about that - I sometimes wish I had had the opportunity to do like MLK and walk up to cops with dogs and not even flinch when getting hit or bitten. There were plenty of beatings, some in the back room, some out in the open, back then. On the other hand, why complain about surviving intact?

We "baby boomers" have come through some incredible, and noble times. It's one thing to go to war with your country behind you, that's a no-brainer, but to go against the status quo, of your own country and it's values, because it's the right thing to do, takes a special courage. It was only natural for me, being Black, I was born to the struggle, but as for the White people, who jumped in, took the beatings, jail, and gas, (I NEVER GOT GASSED!) I salute you. You erased my natural, and automatic prejudices..... It pains me today, when young African-Americans, take for granted, the things, we struggled to get. And even worse, to display the racism, we hate in others.

On the war effort, I had a different approach. I had a dream I was surronded by bamboo, on my belly and scared. This was senior year in high school. I knew the war was wrong - but, naive me, didn't know why.

A little over a year later I was surronded by bamboo, on my belly and scared. Also, finding out what it was all about the hard way.

When I came back from Nam my father had me have lunch with a friend of his who's son was caught demonstrating at the University. I told him I had a lot of respect for his son and his was doing the right thing - but he didn't know why.

In 1976 when Carter signed the amnesty for those that went to Canada my father tells me that he knows my stance in the past but now I should be mad as hell. I looked him in the eyes and said that these young me did what they had to do, they should have no regrets or feel bad and it should have been done sooner.

The fight is today and it is continuing. As long as we have Trent Lotts, Bob Jones, Tom Delays, Rumsfelts, Wolfowitzs, Cheneys and GWB the fight is not over. There is still ignorance in America!

Amen Bill....BTW, I don't think naive is the word for a high-schooler who somehow felt the war was wrong. When I was in high school, I thought Kennedy could do no wrong, and was correct in trying to "save" the people of Indo-China.

I'm glad I had the experience beatings or not, I tried to stand up for what I believed was right, or wrong politically.

I got lucky in the draft lottery, very lucky but some of my buds we not lucky at all. The ones I know that made it home still thank us all for our efforts to end that damn war.

May I have another beating and a pint now?....
