Yup... they spiked after Katrina... then we had the bubble... it popped... and gas has pretty much settled where it was shortly after Katrina.

I read recently that the two bubbles which will pop next are oil and gold.

All those people that bought gold from Glenn Beck's sponsors are going to be pissed.

Tomorrow is the State of the Union and Obama will be talking about the huge deficit we have. Why didn't we ever hear about it during the Bush admin when during his admin the national debt was more than doubled? The deficits were huge!

But Bush hid them. He didn't put the two wars in the budget like Obama is doing. Remember all those emergency supplementals that congress voted on every few months? 250 billion here, 500 billion there, to fund the wars. We don't have those anymore, because the wars are funded, out in the open, by the budget.

But now, we see the deficit spending that these wars are causing, and suddenly everyone's all outraged.

This money has been draining our treasury for 8 years already.

The 2009 debt number is from the Bush administration's fiscal year. When they post the 2010 numbers, that will be Obama's.

So I was just wondering why the media is so stupid? They keep talking about the huge deficit in the Obama admin. But they never mentioned the doubling of the national debt under the Bush admin. Are they really so stupid that they didn't realize all those war supplementals weren't in the budget and therefore hidden away each year?

You are right. The media is stupid.

Reagan and the two Bushes created 92% of the National Debt by lowering taxes on the rich and increasing wasteful military spending.

</quote>

And yet Republicans dishonestly claim to be the party of fiscal responsibility.

Why do they keep lying?

The thing I remember the most about Katrina was gas prices SOARING over $3.00 overnight because of it and then they never really came back down.

Weird, huh?

It would've been, but I was there doing real estate bird dogging for and learning some buying/selling techniques from a friend.

The city ended up being even more of a freak show than normal.

Oil will only plummet to a certain point now. OPEC will make certain of that.
