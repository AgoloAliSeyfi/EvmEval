In frequent threads here the brain-dead leftists moan about how the "idle rich" (like there is such a thing) don't deserve their money. But look at the other side. The poor in this country enjoy a lifestyle envied by even middle class people in most of the world. What have they done to deserve this? The idlest of the idle rich invest money and help other hard working people get ahead. The poor simply absorb tax payer funding and have babies.

Some people are down and out despite their best efforts. Those are the ones that we seek to help and I've never heard anyone object to that, on either side. Liberals see victims everywhere and coddle anyone who might be willing to support them. Liberal politicians require as many dependents as possible to ensure their power and they are expert at creating government dependents. The premise seems to be that any person is entitled to everything by virtue of the fact that they were born. Liberals expect nothing from their dependents other than blind obedience and a vote. In exchange, the person will receive things for nothing.

I have a huge problem with the growing number of people who seek to scam the system and a government who is reticent to call them up on it. They see increased applications for welfare as a success. It means they have more people who are unlikely to bite the hand that feeds them.

We see illegal aliens getting disability checks, along with free housing, food, utilities and medical. Where is the incentive to work if politicians will support you just for the asking? I know there are needy who have no choice, but I also know there are people who have a choice and they have opted to take what they can even though they could do better for themselves if they were so inclined. Now that more jobs are gone forever, more have no choice but to turn to government. I believe this is by design.

Able bodied people have soaked the system for years and they no longer have the desire to do for themselves. I think this was the intent. Now, those who are hopelessy workshy have increased to the point where they can turn elections in their favor. We were warned by our forefathers that once the majority of the populace realized that they could vote to have the wealth from others passed to them, it was the beginning of the end for the country.

You bet.

Once the public has learned that they can draw from the public largesse then we are done.

We already have 47% of the folks in this country who pay no Fed taxes.

What happens when that number reaches 50%, 55% or 60%?

The takes will outnumber those providing.

Greece anyone??

"And they have been paid appropriately for their labors..."

I think that proably our biggest problem is that that is very rarely true.
It would probably be at least as true to say that those who work the hardest are paid the least.

If you and every other human on Earth could perform the task... you're not going to be paid as much as you would if you had a specialized skill... sorry.. that's the way it is and why fry cooks don't get experienced welder pay

</quote>

Then would you care to explain why so many people with degrees and other specialized skills are fry cooks and dishwashers? If noone needs a welder the special skill won't make you anything. Also there are many jobs that require a lot of trining and/or education, are very important to our society, and still don't pay much.

</quote>

Which jobs are important,competitive, and don't pay much? If you say math/science teachers, the reason is because of union rules, which forbid paying some area teachers more than others.
Almost every instance of extended shortage is the result of gov't policies.

What have the poor done to deserve our support?

Those of you who call yourselves Christians need not ask this question if you are a true follower of Christ.

There have been times in the past, perhaps to this day, when some military families qualified for food stamps, and perhaps other government 'handouts'.

</quote>

During Reagan's terms, I frequently had to help my sailors with families apply for food stamps. Anyone E-5 or below with spouse and 2 kids minimum qualified. I remember it shocking me.
