It is difficult to know what is the future of Thailand.

Important Asian Summits meetings that were to be held there end of last year had to be postponed more than once. The Summits finally went ahead, but then the most important one involving China, Japan and India had to be cancelled.

Apr 10, 2009 PATTAYA, Thailand (Reuters) - Demonstrators who had vowed to disrupt a regional summit in the beach resort of Pattaya scored a victory on Saturday when the foreign ministers of Japan, South Korea and China were forced to cancel a trilateral meeting.

The protesters, supporters of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, blocked the entrance to the meeting venue, and Japanese Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone was unable to reach it from his nearby hotel, a Japanese foreign ministry official said.

"The trilateral meeting has been canceled," the Japanese foreign ministry official said....

The Chinese and South Korean foreign ministers went ahead with a bilateral meeting.....

The three ministers had been expected to discuss their response to North Korea's recent rocket launch, with Japan and China divided on how to deal with the issue.

A state of emergency has been declared. This may be a mistake. What'll happen next?

<quote>
BANGKOK, April 11 (Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva's decision to declare a state of emergency around a cancelled Asian summit has narrowed his options in dealing with anti-government protesters and raises questions about whether he has the backing of the military.

Political developments in the next 48 hours could determine the fate of his four-month-old coalition government.

Here are some possible consequences:

* The degree of enforcement by security forces of the emergency will determine Abhisit's largely untested leadership, and whether he can keep the emboldened, largely rural supporters of exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra under control.

* Abhisit has been considerably weakened by his failure to stop the demonstrators getting anywhere near the summit, which will be interpreted as a sign of indecisiveness even if the aim was to avoid bloodshed.

* Abhisit's gamble on invoking an emergenc risks fomenting widespread civil strife with unpredictable consequences if the military fails to stand firmly behind him.

* Bloodshed following any crackdown on Thaksin's red-shirted supporters will put pressure on Abhisit to step down and call a snap election, or let Thailand's fractious parliament choose a successor.

* Bloodshed could even lead to the military stepping in and mounting another coup, after the one in 2006 that ousted Thaksin, although the army has made it clear repeatedly during months of unrest that it did not want to get involved in politics again....

It is a great pity a few of these Asian summit meetings had to be postponed. Here is a $10 billion reason.

<a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKTRE53B08A20090412">China planned $10 billion invest fund at failed summit</a>

<quote>
Apr 12, 2009 BEIJING (Reuters) - China had planned to announce a $10 billion (6.8 billion pound) infrastructure investment fund and offer credit to neighbours at a cancelled weekend summit of Asian leaders in Thailand, its foreign minister said.

Anti-government protestors forced the cancellation of the summit in Pattaya after they swarmed into the summit venue.

In an interview with state media on a flight back to China, Foreign minister Yang Jiechi avoided direct criticism of the Thai government while detailing measures that Chinese premier Wen Jiabao had planned to offer at the summit.

China plans to establish a $10 billion China-ASEAN investment cooperation fund to promote infrastructure that connects it to ASEAN nations, Yang said.

China has been active in building roads from its southern border through neighbouring Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam, to ease trade.

It will also offer a credit of $15 billion to ASEAN countries, including preferential loans of $1.7 billion for cooperation projects, Yang said.....

While not an ASEAN member, China's growing economic clout, huge market and competitive exports make it an important participant in ASEAN summits,...

China recently appointed its first ambassador to ASEAN, after the 10-member grouping formally adopted a charter.
