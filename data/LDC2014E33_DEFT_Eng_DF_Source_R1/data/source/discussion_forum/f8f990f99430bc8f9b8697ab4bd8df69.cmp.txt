You are a fine one to lecture on manners, you fucking freak.

I prefer to judge on facts, not hysterical whining and the bullshit in the media. It's not my fault you're stupid so name-calling won't change the fact. You're a ranting idiot and I am not. Live with it.

However, your posts do disprove one old wife's tale "With age comes wisdom".... clearly not.

Join this topic of conversation of go fuck yourself, CaliforniaGirl. No one asked you to opine on my freaking manners...the Op is "Boycott BP", not attempt to pee in my Wheaties.

I think you need more help than a call to Mommy is likely to raise, you infected pus-filled cunt.

Go seep elsewhere.

On topic: Anyone who thinks that BP should be boycotted has an IQ smaller than their shoe size.

Off Topic: The old adage 'with age comes wisdom' is definitely not accurate.

Fuck you, you stupid blind bitch.

I don't know how to go about seeking vengence on BP for desecration of the Gulf. I am beside myself. My best friend #3 was going to St. George Island with her family for Mother's Day this weekend. But they will probably cancel because the oil slick will have reached those sugary sand beaches by then.

About a month after the ocean's shores have been befouled, the inland waterways will begin showing the devasation. The Wakulla River, where my kidlet taught me to canoe. The St. John's River, where we hung out in a biker bar in St. Mark's on Fridays after work, eating broiled shrimp and drinking cheap beer, just watching the Earth do it's thing.

Eventually the oil will travel the underground and above-ground aquifer to every Florida body of water, including the beleagered Everglades...a natural phenomena unparrelled on Planet Earth and precious not only to Florida, but to the entire Planet for the role it plays in our wildlife, ecosystem and so on.

Death would not be too severe a punishment for BP's CEO, as I see it.

Don't buy BP gasoline!

Try to boycott, especially if you are purchasing large quantities for a commercial trucking, farming or airline business.

I welcome any additional ideas on how to afflict BP.

I am just heart broken. I cannot tell you what this preventable insult to the Earth will be like for all of Florida, and beyond.

Having lived in Tampa, Orange Park and Jacksonville, I certainly feel your outrage at the carelessness that was in play before this disaster took place and the loss of these natural treasures. So what should we do with the Obama Administration since they accepted the campaign contributions of BP then granted them exemptions from safety standards that would have prevented this catastrophe?

Certainly BP is guilty of buying off our president, but our president is also guilty of willingly being bought off. Personally, I think I'll continue to buy BP products and boycott the corrupt Obama Administration that gave BP an exemption to safety standards.

Blah blah blah...been hashed and rehashed for days now. Campaign contributions have zero to do with this accident. None, nada, zip.
