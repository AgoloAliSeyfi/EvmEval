His personal life aside--that is only fair since apparently only Republicans are fair game to have their personal lives closely scrutinized and criticized--Newt is by far the best educated, has the highest IQ, and the most impressive knowledge, recall ability, and vision of any of the candidates running this year.

In his professional life he has pulled two major blunders. One was in taking on the dishonest and corrupt James Wright and forcing his resignation over a book deal in the Reagan Administration and then writing his own book which of course triggered the same kinds of accusations. Hypocrisy is allowed on the left, but is not to be tolerated on the right.

The second was the same sort of thing when he imprudently forced the impeachment of President Clinton on grounds that most of us didn't think rose the the level of high crimes and misdemeanors. Those grounds had nothing to do with Monica Lewinsky, but the left, having a less sophisticated constituency, was able to make it look like it did and then could trash Newt from engaging in his own infidelity. More hypocrisy that is allowed on the left, but is not to be tolerated on the right.

Can Newt live down that kind of baggage in a head to head contest with Barack Obama? Given that the MSM will play up all of Newt's baggage while continuing to ignore Obama's, I don't know.

Newt right now is not my favorite of the candidates, but I wouldn't have to hold my nose to vote for him a year from November, and he would be heads and shoulders above the current occupant of the White House.

He's also just about as big a bigot and racist as Pat Buchanan. Who's also very smart and savvy.

You really believe that the impeachment was on solid ground?

No. As I said Clinton was absolutely guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice to the detriment of a private citizen and that is indefensible and was enough to get him suspended from the bar in the Supreme Court, in Arkansas, and charged with contempt of court in New York.

But it did not, in my opinion, rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors that justified impeachment. The Senate seemed to be of that same opinion as, even though Republican controlled, chose not to convict him and force him out of office.

I'm sure in your mind he is Sallow. Most leftists buy into all the hate stuff put out there on somebody like Newt. I have not seen any bigotry or racism in Gingrich however, nor in Buchanan for that matter--Buchanan has been right on the edge of anti-semitism a time or two however--but both have focused mostly on the truth of the human condition which, to the left, is not allowed in our politically correct world.

Clintons transgressions appear to be forgiven by the left. Aw whats a little obstruction of justice and perjury. Jeeze the guy was only a sitting POTUS.

As for Newt well lets get out the tar and feathers.

Newt the smartest guy in the room and is way more competant that the joker sitting in the oval office right now.

Of course I would be very surprised if the got the nomination even though he is way more than able.
