All the cons do is blah blah blah blah blah because they cannot talk objectively about the issue.

The health insurance industry raped the American public. It is now being castrated.

Where we differ is that probably see Government as an innocent Bystander,where I view Government as the Silent Partner, or Conspirator.

I don't see how you think this bill is a jump in to socialism...it falls WAY SHORT of anything like such....there is no take over...everything is still ALL DONE with the private sector....with their profits, with their every whim being met....we the people have lost, insurance companies have won big time.... a gvt take over and single payer plan would be welcomed by me, in a heartbeat, compared to the assholes at the insurance companies....I'd take a medicare type plan that i paid in to, any day of the week over these suckers... I have been clear on that...I am NOT afraid of it...because it can NOT be any worse than it is now imo.

If you would just read, you would see that it is designed to destroy the private insurance companies. In five years they will be extinct or no more than puppet plans sponsored by the government and the government will have full control of the industry.

You would take a medicare plan that was funded on IOU's just like Social Security because you do not think about what our great grand children will have to play with in the future. We have already saddled them with our debt, a debt this country will never be able to dig its way out of and you want to add hundreds of billions of more dollars to it because you hate the idea of anyone making a profit.

A don't try giving my that bullshit that it will be fully funded by those who are insured, because you know as well as I do that that is bullshit.

You know, sometimes I think you play this 'card' of yours just to see if you can get me angry at you immie... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/doubt.gif"/>

Unless something has changed in the language of the Public Option insurance plan that was in hr3200....

there is NOTHING DESIGNED in this bill with the public insurance option to destroy the insurance companies out...stop LYING please...that is your opinion but that is FAR FROM FACT.... I realize that you do not think you are lying, but it is a LIE none the less immie....it is NOT designed to bring the insurance companies down, it IS DESIGNED in the manner to give them ALL A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD so that true competition exists.

The Public Option CAN NOT BE PAID FOR WITH TAXES...it says so in the legislation. STOP STOP STOP NOW WITH THAT LIE...please, I have had enough of this lie, why? BECAUSE IT IS A LIE....

The public option has NO ADVANTAGE GIVEN THEM by the government over the private sector....if the private sector fails, it fails because of what the private sector does to themselves, and I can assure you, they will NOT GO BELLY UP, WITHOUT A FIGHT.....and that fight will entail the private insurance companies becoming MORE EFFICIENT themselves....THAT is the whole idea of the public option.

This entire bill is NOT what i have come to believe is the way to go with our health care...I believe we should just go in to a single payer plan for all of us, paid for through the money we now spend on private insurance, via new taxes...yep, I have no faith in the insurance companies to bring the cost of health insurance down to an affordable level, especially WITHOUT the public insurance plan to keep them honest.

The Public Option is set up that IT CAN NOT BECOME a SINGLE PAYER PLAN....

Because the Plan holders all pay their own premium, the government does NOT PAY IT through taxes on them....

So again, even if unintentional, what you keep saying about this Public Insurance Option as being DESIGNED to bring the insurance companies down, it's a lie....it is specifically designed to be COMPETITION, with no favors.

Will it lead people to be happy with it and make them think that a single payer plan might be ok, somewhere down the road, someday? THAT may be the case...BUT if the public ever chose to go the route of a single payer insurer, IT WILL NOT BE THIS PUBLIC INSURANCE OPTION, IT CAN'T BE, according to the LEGISLATION because it was NOT DESIGNED TO BE..

I'm not even going to read all that BS care. The first sentence of the third paragraph was enough. Of course, the language does not specifically state that the intention of the plan is to eliminate private insurance. You used to analyze the market for selling shoes. Why don't you put your little brain to work and think about what exactly the language in hr3200 would do.

Is Congress going to come out and say, "it is our express goal to eliminate completely one large segment of the American Economy and put hundreds of thousands of individuals out of work"? Hell no they are not. But if you even tried to read the language, you would see that is what will happen.
