Can anyone explain to me how the Russians have "caught up" ?

- We have the most powerful Air Force (and Naval Air) on earth
- We have the most advanced avionics
- We have the best missiles
- We have the best intelligence
- We have air superiority in any theater on earth

The Russians tried for 50 years to keep up with us and they couldn't. What makes you think they are our equal now or anytime in the forseeable future?

Are you kidding me?

The US has the best intelligence capability on earth. Satellite surveilance, NSA monitors millions of transmissions, AWACS, Electronic Warfare.....
In terms of air superiority....we know where you are before you know where we are

They just finished testing a stealth aircraft comparable to our F22 Rapter so now we're on the same playing field with them. They now have the only space program capable of delivering heavy payloads into space.

By the way....Chinese pilots can clean our clocks in dogfights so I wouldn't pound my chest too much if I were you.

Oh.....please

First off......Dogfights are a small portion of air superiority and rarely happen

Second......You are going to have to provide a link on the magnificent Chinese

And what did that WMD thingy have to do with air superiority. We are talking about situational awareness type of intellegence as it relates to knowing where your enemy is and him knowing where you are

We spend more on defense that every other country combined.

If we have anything to fear from the Russians (or anyone else), then we are getting the royal screw job from Congress, the Pentagon, and the defense contractors.

Not really...and our satellite program is going by the wayside because Obama cut funding for our Space program. We can't even launch a vehicle to capture them anymore.

But the best intel program I know of is Israeli Intelligence. Out of necessity they aren't political like ours is. Dumb-asses like Obama can't step in and destroy their capabilities over night.
