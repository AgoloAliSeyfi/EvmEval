you are the one that wants free health care, not me and by the way the proposals going through congress right now are not going to be free.

Yes, before cobra, an employee was without, after cobra the employee is still without. The cobra law sucked. It didn't help and the arra doesn't help a whole hell of a lot either.

The problem is that normal laidoff person could not (pre-arra) and still cannot (post arra) afford health insurance during such a period. It doesn't help at all. Arra is an effort to improve conditions, but it is not sufficient for most people who when laid off have to worry about where the mortgage is going to come from and can't even begin to worry about how they can pay health insurance premiums. Even with arra it is out of reach. That is why the cobra laws suck.

well pea brain, you've identified the very heart of our health care crisis, coverage is tied to your job and no one can afford health insurance on their own, especially if they lose their job, and if you want to improve yourself by changing jobs, you have to weigh the value of the coverage you will lose due to "now" preexisting conditions...but your pea brainism is placing the blame on a program that has absolutely no blame at all, cobra offers some assistance vs. Absolutely none before it's enactment...

So, paying 35% vs. 100% is still not good enough for you, and you accuse me of wanting free health care...

i don't want free health care. Although, i would be more than happy to be taxed to help those who need it.

Taxes... Are collected by whom????????? (hint: Starts with a G)

cobra does not do the job for those in need, nor does arra solve the problem. Both are government failures... And idiots like you want to add another failure to the package. I am not opposed to helping the poor. I never have been.

I am, however, concerned about adding another program doomed to failure that won't solve the problem.

SO, the entity (hint: Starts with a G) our founding fathers created to address citizen grievances and to protect the public good is a failure...well maybe your fairy godmother will pay for your health insurance?

Obviously, you have no argument.

It has been proven to you over and over that COBRA is a failure. The citizens who are to be assisted by both COBRA and ARRA are not helped by it, yet you continue to claim it is a great program.

You are the dolt, Bfgrn, yes you. You said that the program did not suck because it continued health care for those who are unemployed. Yet, when it is proven that it does not provide health insurance for the poor you fall back on mularky and claim, I want free health insurance without even a basis for such a lie.

Yeah, your are an idiot of the third class. Come up with a real argument as to why you think COBRA is a worthwhile program, if you can.

Guess what? Normal, everyday people that don't work for big companies can't afford health care at all. At all.

This entire discussion about COBRA is silly.

Tell that to Bfgrn. He thinks that COBRA helps the unemployed and that a single payer system will solve everyone's problems.
