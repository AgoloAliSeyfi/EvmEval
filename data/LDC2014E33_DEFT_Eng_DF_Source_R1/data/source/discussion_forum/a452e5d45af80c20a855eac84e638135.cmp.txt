Short version:

<quote>
BRITAIN'S sleaze watchdog has attacked Tony Blair for failing to uphold standards in public life after a succession of scandals.

Sir Alistair Graham, appointed by the PM to oversee politicians' behaviour, says that Blair "sees standards as a peripheral, minor issue not worthy of serious consideration".

By contrast, Gordon Brown, who met Graham last month, was much more supportive.

It emerged this weekend that further arrests may be "imminent" in the investigation into the alleged loans-for-honours scandal.

Graham reveals his frustration at Blair's reluctance to adopt his recommendations on improving politicians' behaviour. On cronyism, he says: "We have given recommendations as to how the government could address that. They accepted many of our recommendations but they didn't accept those."

"We suspect he is pretty lukewarm to the work we do, though it is interesting where we suggested changes to improve ethical standards in local government, [the government] accepted all of those."

Graham believes an independent figure should be appointed to study alleged breaches of the ministerial code, which is currently policed by the prime minister.

Well, they do deserve each other... and perhaps she would feel right at home here on A2K?

A good quote and a funny piece of trivia in here too..

[..] During the nine years her husband has been in power, Cherie Blair has been skewered in the press for everything from her political comments to her choice of friends.

In an interview with the BBC she said it would be "arrogant and foolish" to say she did everything right.

When pressed about mistakes she said: "I don't own up to them publicly. I'm never really in a situation where it gets to that."

The latest unwelcome spotlight shone on her this week when she was criticised for signing a copy of the official report into a government scientist's suicide which was then offered for auction at a fundraiser for the Labour Party. [..]

Cherie Blair forcefully dismissed criticism when asked about her 7,000 pound hairdressing bill during the last election, saying "Honestly what a load of fuss about trivia".

A prominent human rights barrister who herself bid to become a parliamentary candidate, she was once picked in a poll as the person Britons most wanted to deport. [..]

YouGov pollster Peter Kellner [..] said the contrast with former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's husband Denis could not be more stark.

"You will recall that when invited once to speak at a White House dinner, he famously got up and said 'Like Mark Anthony entering Cleopatra's tent, I have not come here to talk.'"

A poll conducted by Ipsos/MORI for the Sun newspaper suggests the Tories are 10 points ahead of Labour with Mr Blair's rating dropping to minus 41, his lowest.

Two thirds of voters said they were dissatisfied with his leadership.

The poll was carried out between 25 and 30 May, with 1,984 people interviewed.

What can he do next?

One of these days Tony Blair will step down as prime minister. But then what? Will he write his autobiography? Try for the top job at the UN? Or just make loads of money on the celebrity lecture circuit? Michael White weighs up the options

We all know that Tony Blair will leave Downing Street shortly, probably "sooner rather than later", as Jack Straw helpfully puts it. No one knows exactly when, not even Blair. But that's the easy bit. Much harder is what a healthy retired statesman, just 54 years old next May, does with the rest of his life.
Winning and leaving office young and fit is a modern problem; in the old days, exhausted political volcanoes generally went quiet and died. When they refused to go quiet - Ted Heath and Margaret Thatcher spring to mind - they were able to do great damage to the parties they had once loved. Blair will not do that, but what will he do?

Even before he became Labour leader Blair used to say in private: "I don't need this. There's more to life than politics - I can walk away." He says it still, despite his determination to hang on to office. But walk to what?
