His personal life aside--that is only fair since apparently only Republicans are fair game to have their personal lives closely scrutinized and criticized--Newt is by far the best educated, has the highest IQ, and the most impressive knowledge, recall ability, and vision of any of the candidates running this year.

In his professional life he has pulled two major blunders. One was in taking on the dishonest and corrupt James Wright and forcing his resignation over a book deal in the Reagan Administration and then writing his own book which of course triggered the same kinds of accusations. Hypocrisy is allowed on the left, but is not to be tolerated on the right.

The second was the same sort of thing when he imprudently forced the impeachment of President Clinton on grounds that most of us didn't think rose the the level of high crimes and misdemeanors. Those grounds had nothing to do with Monica Lewinsky, but the left, having a less sophisticated constituency, was able to make it look like it did and then could trash Newt from engaging in his own infidelity. More hypocrisy that is allowed on the left, but is not to be tolerated on the right.

Can Newt live down that kind of baggage in a head to head contest with Barack Obama? Given that the MSM will play up all of Newt's baggage while continuing to ignore Obama's, I don't know.

Newt right now is not my favorite of the candidates, but I wouldn't have to hold my nose to vote for him a year from November, and he would be heads and shoulders above the current occupant of the White House.

He's also just about as big a bigot and racist as Pat Buchanan. Who's also very smart and savvy.

I'm sure in your mind he is Sallow. Most leftists buy into all the hate stuff put out there on somebody like Newt. I have not seen any bigotry or racism in Gingrich however, nor in Buchanan for that matter--Buchanan has been right on the edge of anti-semitism a time or two however--but both have focused mostly on the truth of the human condition which, to the left, is not allowed in our politically correct world.

Oh gosh, really?

And you write for a newspaper or something like that?

Bigotry is holding that one's culture or religion is superior to others and racism is holding that one's race is superior to others.

Both Newt and Pat have commented and wrote about the superiority of the west, Christainity and the white race. Google is your friend.

Clintons transgressions appear to be forgiven by the left. Aw whats a little obstruction of justice and perjury. Jeeze the guy was only a sitting POTUS.

As for Newt well lets get out the tar and feathers.

Newt the smartest guy in the room and is way more competant that the joker sitting in the oval office right now.

Of course I would be very surprised if the got the nomination even though he is way more than able.

What "transgressions"? Clinton got a blowjob. That's it.

Reagan made a deal with Iran to get elected and funded terrorists that raped and killed American nuns.

Bush II lied about Iraq. And completely lied about it. Killed thousands.

Those are REAL transgression.

Nothing will happen to either man.

I am aware of the slant that people like you put on it. I have also read what both have written on the subject. And your take is mean spirited and based on the leftist political correct notion that the white race or the American/European culture is NEVER to be recognized for any accomplishments and anyone who presumes to do so shall be branded white supremacist and/or racist.

Ability to analyze content critically, reading comprehension, and honest critique would be your friend if you would allow it to be.
