I along with other Christians will bow to Allah (who is the same God I worship anyway) and watch the fireworks.

Most Christions I know will not bow to another God,no matter who that God is.
Thats why so many Christians were killed by the ancient Romans,they refused to bow down.

Also,to use an old cliche..."I would rather die on my feet then live on my knees"

Well then you do not know your God or your Bible so who is the idiot?

I did not say I was a conservative, I am a moderate...
