Idiot...the ICBM force was moved from AFSPC to AFGSC to align the ICBMs and bombers under "one AF Commander" to increase the focus on nukes. Your dumbass didn't know that.

Towards the end of Gen Kehler's time at AFSPC he was in charge of space and cyberspace for the AF, but now at STRATCOM he is in charge of all DoD space, cyberspace, bombers, SLBMs and (drumroll) ICBMs.

Your claim that we only have "14" ICBMs at "3" missile bases spread out across an area larger than Rhode Island shows you are the biggest dumbass on this board next to rdean.

You are digging to China.

Obamination floated the idea of cutting our nuclear arsenal by 80% to the Pentagon.

The response back to the White House from the Pentagon...."Nuts!"

Actual words from Kehler, who knows what ICBM's are worth today; he has discussed upgrading a whole 14 ICBM's for possible use as BACKUP missiles:
************************************************** *
Our mission is to provide an integrated constellation of space and
cyberspace capabilities at the speed of need, and our vision is to be
the leading source of emerging and integrated space and cyberspace
capabilities. At AFSPC, we look forward to assuming the lead role for
cyberspace within the USAF. Air Force operations in the air, space, and
cyberspace domains are mutually-supporting and reciprocally-enabling;
the cyberspace domain is inextricably linked to the other domains in
which the U.S. military operates. Not only must we protect these
domains, we must also properly integrate them with the other
operational domains to create joint warfighting effects significantly
greater than the sum of the parts. Our capabilities are woven through
Joint operations, weapons networks, and civil and economic activities
ranging from missile warning to the position, navigation, and timing
signals we provide both for military use and as a free, international
utility.
Space and cyberspace capabilities shape the American approach to
warfare, are embedded in an ever-more effective arsenal of modern
weaponry and are threaded throughout the fabric of our warfighting
networks. Our space-based capabilities are absolutely vital to the
joint fight. Yesterday's irregular warfare is today's regular warfare;
asymmetric warfare is the new norm. Space capabilities contribute
across the spectrum of regular and irregular combat and non-combat
operations and provide Joint commanders a decisive advantage. Space is
no longer just the high ground; it is a critical joint enabler and
force multiplier.

Idiot, if we lower our numbers to say 4, Russia to 6, and China to 4....we are losing the ability to counter "both" threats.

Throw in Iran getting nukes along with NK's nukes.

It's clear your tiny brain doesn't understand deterrence.

Yeah, Russia and China are our friends and don't have nukes. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

Iran is also one of our buddies too.....eh?

The cold war is over, amazing how many people still get a feeling of security from having the ability to sterilize the biosphere. Keep enough to merely destroy mankind and shitcan the rest.

Typical all or nothing response, Who is talking about getting rid of them? I am suggesting that the ready capability for total Armageddon is a useless waste of money and resources. We almost certainly have the capability to destroy the bulk of mankind several times over, we could lose much of it and still maintain an acceptable balance of terror for scared people like yourself.
