You are quite insane:

<quote orig_author="mudwhistle">
After cutting the F24 program last year and now canceling the moon program...not to mention allowing to let the Shuttle program to expire without funding a replacement...President Obama has allowed the Russians not only to catch up military-wise but he is also making us dependent on them to be able to fix our satellites. We have to rely on Russian spacecraft from now on to get us into space. We are essentially grounded by the middle of this year.

Do you think the Russians can be trusted to let us hitch a ride to the Space Station or allow us to fix our communications satellites.

Does it make you feel good that our national security will be in the hands of our enemies?

Well...the cuts this dumb-ass President has put in place has done exactly that.

Strange how this simple fact isn't being reported by anyone....even FNC.

We're in deep trouble folks.

Obama has high marks for likablity in the polls. His agenda is getting ripped in the polls.

Go to NasaWatch home page. Seems there isn't a whole lot of disagreement with this decision after all. And this was of particular interest. (I thought conservatives WANTED private enterprise to do all the heavy lifting?)

I'm aware of the 50 million given to Space-X for the CRV in fact I already posted the information on it in another thread. One other thing, the reason why most like me think private enterprise is the ONLY way to go now is because our Govt. does not have the vision or the courage to sustain a program like Apollo. If you work in the research part of NASA, Ames etc. I'm sure your overjoyed at this decision, however, I would suggest you see how well this decision is goping over at Johnson and Huntsville. Further, the former director of NASA might disagree with that assertion as well.

Doesn't have the vision to "sustain" Apollo? How old IS that program? The space program has advanced far beyond Apollo because it has been sustained. You really do need to read what other experts in the field are saying, my friend. I realize your take on this is strictly from a patriotic point of view, and that's noble, but really, the "moon" has become secondary to exploration of other realms within our galaxy. Here's a list of articles for you to peruse.

The moon is the only thing close enough to explore. We need to practice on the Moon before we can land and takeoff on Mars. The advances that building a base on the Moon would helpful when it comes to exploring the rest of space...if we ever do. Thanks to Obama's cuts all of this is lost.

Now the Space-shuttle program is going tits up thanks to him so we're pretty much out of the space business. I guess this his way of sucking up to other countries like China and Russia. Putting our programs in mothballs.
