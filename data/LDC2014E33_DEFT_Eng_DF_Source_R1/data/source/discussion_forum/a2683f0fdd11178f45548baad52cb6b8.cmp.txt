Indeed the argument can stretch very far - btw I'm also a newbie, perhaps we an be newbie buddies lol- but nowhere else in society is the relationship of private profits from public funding so concentrated and so unavoidable. I can't actually think of anywhere else where things are set up to run like that and tlwhere there's a valid argument that the state could run a better service.

Yes, Tesco will obviously have a great incentive to invest in the company because they know that its very unlikely - especially in their present form- that they won't exist in another 5 years. Train companies on the other hand don't, they can never be sure if after one 5 year lease the government will grant them an rights to run services on the track for another 5 years, which is why they chicken-feed invest and have the state to do the rest, which is why for example the same rolling stock is being used on a privatised GWR as was during BR, because the company can't be added to commit themselves to spending if they're not sure if they'll be around in a decades time. The only guaranteed changed a company will warrant is new liveries on trains which is what first to best.

Take Thameslink for example, First Group are using the same rolling stock from the 80's because instead of buying their own carriages, they've planned on waiting for the government to purchase the carriages (I've forgotten the number) for the north-south route which is desperately overcrowded. Instead, all First Group did was purchase well over 20year old, discount cheap stock from Southern and change the liveries, then voi la - apparently that's private investment.

Their 'new' carriages simply aren't up to scratch, hence why Southern sold them. And the only reason why Southern took it upon themselves to buy new stock as opposed to waiting for the limped-legged treasury is because they were recently given a 7 year lease to run services out of London Bridge/ Victoria et al into the latter part of the next decade. That's the only way how private rail can run, by giving very lengthy leases to smaller companies (ideally even smaller than Southern), giving them an opportunity to grow an fund themselves - permitting that fares are regulated properly. But even then I'd be slightly against it for the reasons I've mentioned before.

I want to argue against that, but you're right - points accepted. Rep for thee!

EDIT: How the fluck can I have given out too much rep if I haven't repped anyone yet. :|

lol. You don't seriously expect society to disintegrate because people are doing more business do you?

</quote>

No. I expect it to disintegrate because I believe many vital services cannot be delivered for a profit. Thus they will not be provided at all, and thus society will start to break down.

<quote orig_author="jesusandtequila">
Where there is demand for something, it can make a profit. If not, then the members of society don't value it - since the demand is not there.

I cannot agree.
How is an out of office GP's service in a rural area supposed to be profitable for example?
You cannot use "well the demand isn't there" bull****, because such services have to be provided, else people will suffer and die.

Except for the most part, the trains / carriages are not owned by the ToC's. They are owned by third party companies who essentially rent the rolling stock to the ToC's. There are examples of ToC's owning train sets (FGW own a few of the HST's they use for example), but in general the actual trains are not owned by them.

What you say is true some of the time, but certainly not all / most of the time.
