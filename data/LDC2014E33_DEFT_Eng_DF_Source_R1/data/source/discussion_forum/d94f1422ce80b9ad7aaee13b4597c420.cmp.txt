And yet, Dutch ships are there. And Norway's ships are as well and they've been there since the rig blew up.

Amazing that no one ever researches this stuff for themselves and instead depends on rightwing blogs to do their thinking.

Amazing that you actually applaud what has been going on. From the article I posted, you allude to:

<quote>
...In sharp contrast to Dutch preparedness before the fact and the Dutch instinct to dive into action once an emergency becomes apparent, witness the American reaction to the Dutch offer of help. The U.S. government responded with "Thanks but no thanks," remarked Visser, despite BP's desire to bring in the Dutch equipment and despite the no-lose nature of the Dutch offer --the Dutch government offered the use of its equipment at no charge. Even after the U.S. refused, the Dutch kept their vessels on standby, hoping the Americans would come round. By May 5, the U.S. had not come round. To the contrary, the U.S. had also turned down offers of help from 12 other governments, most of them with superior expertise and equipment --unlike the U.S., Europe has robust fleets of Oil Spill Response Vessels that sail circles around their make-shift U.S. counterparts.

That is why the 'ships were there.' Not being used.

On the 29th of JUNE-the headlines were that the US would accept international help:

<a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ifF-1MJID_xuJP1UjukE1SQG66aQD9GL90P80">The Associated Press: US accepts international assistance for Gulf spill</a>

However if one reads, they are not removing the guidelines that would allow the super ships to work. Just more of the hauling water around and getting nothing of substance done...

The headline is wrong. International help has been used since day one.

Your first article is full of misinformation, lies, and a partisan agenda.

Prior to the dutch ships arriving, they sent the sweeper arms to be used on US ships.

And again, Norway has six or seven skimmers in the Gulf. Sounds to me like the Dutch are trying to make money off the tragedy and so are bad mouthing America.

Ravi, perhaps some specifics on the lies, misinformation, and LOL partisan agenda? Face it, the administration figured they can use this 'crisis' to further cap and trade. Unfortunately the people of the US really do value those jobs, the environment, and the coastal waters. They are very unhappy with what is going on and it's one more problem that Obama &amp; Co., are getting tarred with.
