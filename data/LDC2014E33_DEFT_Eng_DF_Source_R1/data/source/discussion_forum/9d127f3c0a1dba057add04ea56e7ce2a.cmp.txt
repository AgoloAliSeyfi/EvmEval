I don't wish death on him...just a massive stroke.

I hope he lives a long time as a veggie before they pull the plug.

Ah. You want him to share your fate.

Sandra Fluke is not the first women to kick the shit out of Rush, Hillary did it first.

While her husband was getting a blow job in the Oval Office. And she and her daughter were upstairs.

An intern was on her knees sucking him off.

Lets talk truth.

Who the fuck caress?

Lets talk truth.

Truth???

OK.... Sandra Fluke needs to keep her damn legs shut, and stop asking me to help pay for her sexual promiscuity.
Obama needs to tend to presidential shit, and leave Rush alone.
The left needs to listen to what is said from their side of the aisle for a 'CHANGE'.

Hows that for a start?

Like I said, he will never apologize. This proves my point.

</quote>

No. It proves you were wrong.

Your post proves you lack honesty.

</quote>

Did you actually read the "apology" or did you just spew that robotically?

</quote>

Yep. I read it. Unlike you or Zoom, I also grasped what he was saying.

Someday, with lots of education, you too might be able to understand what words mean.

Anybody seen apologies for names given to Governor Palin?

Just curious. The high and mighty seem to be going overboard on this. How about names given to Governor Palin's children?

Trig rings a bell.

Here's the text of the so-called "apology" issued Saturday by the Fat Man. If this was any weaker, it would look like swiss cheese with all the holes in it. Of course, it'll appease his dittoloonies.
"For over 20 years, I have illustrated the absurd with absurdity, three hours a day, five days a week. In this instance, I chose the wrong words in my analogy of the situation. I did not mean a personal attack on Ms. Fluke.

"I think it is absolutely absurd that during these very serious political times, we are discussing personal sexual recreational activities before members of Congress. I personally do not agree that American citizens should pay for these social activities. What happened to personal responsibility and accountability? Where do we draw the line? If this is accepted as the norm, what will follow? Will we be debating if taxpayers should pay for new sneakers for all students that are interested in running to keep fit? In my monologue, I posited that it is not our business whatsoever to know what is going on in anyone's bedroom nor do I think it is a topic that should reach a Presidential level.

"My choice of words was not the best, and in the attempt to be humorous, I created a national stir. I sincerely apologize to Ms. Fluke for the insulting word choices."

</quote>

Apology...what apology?

</quote>

The very last sentence, for starters, might provide you with a clue:

Rush said, in that very last sentence, and I quote, "I sincerely apologize to Ms. Fluke for the insulting word choices."

Can you link to Fluke talking about needing birth control for her sex life?

You didn't watch her testimony and you are making a fool of yourself, but keep going.
