Jeb would have to cheat to win a national election.

The republicans cant cheat that much anymore because the electronic machines are being watched more closely now.

From your link:

<quote>
Our aim is to remind Americans of these lessons and to draw their consequences for today. Here are four consequences:  we need to increase defense spending significantly if we are to carry out our global
responsibilities today and modernize our armed forces for the future;

 we need to strengthen our ties to democratic allies and to challenge regimes hostile to our interests and values;

 we need to promote the cause of political and economic freedom abroad;

 we need to accept responsibility for America's unique role in preserving and extending an international order friendly to our security, our prosperity, and our principles.

I see absolutely nothing wrong with those goals.

I take it that you would suggest quite the opposite?

That's coming along just fucking splendidly so far...

Wry is stereo typical. He can't see the harm his side causes and denies the good the other side does.

He's a lot like TM, they can be proven wrong by using thier own links against them.
