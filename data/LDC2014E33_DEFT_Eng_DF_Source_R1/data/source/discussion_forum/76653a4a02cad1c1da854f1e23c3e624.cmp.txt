Well in the States it's preferable to not take out health insurance unless your employer can provide it (so this leaves out a ton of people). It preferable to look for a job with upward mobility than go to college or at least attend a trade school where you can accumulate less debt. And this isn't the difference between whiskey and a college education, man! This is the difference between getting a nice cell phone (which you need) and a health insurance plan that's too costly. It's the difference between getting a nice car with cool rims, and paying for college (which most of the time is useless in the States unless you go to a nice school or major in something relevant). Many Americans live paycheck to paycheck and most opt for immediate necessities like car, cell phone, clothes, purses, etc. and since they're cheap they go for the nicer things. Imagine living like this without the social benefits you guys in the UK cherish?
Purchase other stuff on a Visa and pay the minimum. Repeat cycle.

Actually I think you'll find a slim majority do pay it off on time. Amex love it, charging a higher rake from retailers to compensate themselves.

You're on a UK based forum, please don't turn the conversation American. So it is about whisky (no e thank you) and not about health insurance. I can imagine it but its tricky, its hard to know the impact a lower tax take would have for instance.

Every man and his dog wanted to lend you money or re-mortage your house to get a luxury holiday, new telly or new handbag that you deserve. All the excess was paid with debt because people could not really afford the life style they "deserved".

The wages increased a slight bit (and not from 70s level but from 80s levels) but most economists agree that they've been stagnant for quite some time. They don't see it getting any higher considering that production is overseas and credit can never supplant real money (which cheap credit is the real reason for the slight nudge in purchasing power).

Secondly, there is a fault in your argument because of factors including employment and production. The post war years were unique in that there was an increase in wages and there was way more production going on. This made things cheaper and people had more money.

Ta for the graph. It doesn't show what you said though: 'This stagnated in the 70s and our purchasing power has been dropping ever since.' but demonstrates I wasn't right either.
