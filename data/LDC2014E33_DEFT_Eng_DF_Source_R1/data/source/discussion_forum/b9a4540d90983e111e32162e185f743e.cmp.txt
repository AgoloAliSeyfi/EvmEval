The OWS movement rails about "greed", like we can outlaw an emotion.
But what is greed? Is someone who works hard because he wants to get ahead greedy? I don't think anyone would say so.
It seems greed is wanting money that legitimately doesn't belong to you. I can be as greedy as I want, but unless someone gives me money voluntarily then it doesn't do much. If I deceive someone, then I am a criminal. But if I deliver on what I've promised then I've earned my money.
By that definition the OWS crowd are the greedy ones. They demand their student loans get paid off, yet they've done nothing to deserve that. They demand--well, I dont know what they want. Neither do they. But demanding someone else's money is greed.

Greedy is as greedy does.

If you truly don't know what greed means than nobody is going to be able to explain it to you.

"For Geoff Smart, a leadership consultant and bestselling author, the most effective strategy for reshaping policy is to reshape government itself. He would like to see more business leaders take a sabbatical from corporate life to do stints in the public sector at all levels of government. Smart argues that, rather than run for office, a strategy thatÂ’s had mixed results, leaders need to apply their skills within the bureaucracy of government itself."

Greed is when you have a 20 gallon cooler of GatorAid and the 3rd string benchwarmers drink it all before halftime.
Greed is when you are out on the flats bayfishing and you have had a 125 pound tarpon on for 30 minutes and newbie sea legs drinks the last 3 brews in the cooler before you boat your fish.
Greed is when you are wealthy and lobby your representatives for special tax breaks because you are over 60 years of age.

We already knew you couldn't explain it, but it's not because of any problem with your audiences powers of understanding.

" At this moment, tens of thousands of Americans in Iraq, Afghanistan and all over the world are under arms and in peril, engaged in conflicts that serve only to prolong this terrible, endless age of war. At this moment, millions of innocent people are cowering somewhere because of it.

Make no mistake: someone is, at this moment, bathing in riches at the expense of those soldiers, their families, and the untold scores of civilians whose only crime was getting in the way of the first, best, and biggest payday of this new century. The last ten years have been a festival of profit-taking for a small collection of people you will never meet."
