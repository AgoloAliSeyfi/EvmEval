More tax money needs to be spent in Scotland in order to maintain:
1) People - as they're poorer
2) Infrastructure - as in some areas, it's not used as much.

The cost of living is also much cheaper in Scotland than in England, therefore their wages will get them just as far as an English person. Average Scottish house price £153,248, average UK house price is £230,562 as the BBC didn't supply the English one itself...

Yes its unfair, but grow a pair and calm down and for Gods sake don't resent your heritage! Also surely if you can prove you are part Scottish you could go to a Scottish university for free?

Nope, Dad's from Cullen, North Scotland however as we live in England, Cambridge, I can't go to a Scottish Uni for free. My cousin went to Aberdeen for free though as her family still live in Scotland, although thank God I've never had to!!

What is SO bad about Scotland that you wouldn't want to live here then?

I recently wrote a letter to my local MP (Mr Vara - NW Cambridgeshire) asking him how the Government can still provide Scottish students with free university fees, whilst English and Welsh students are having to dish out up to £9000 each year. I got the usual answer, how the Scottish parliament all voted on this issue, and due to the devolution agreement the British government are unable to overturn this decision.
Firstly, this just seems ridiculous, how possibly can they consider raising our fees whilst Scottish students are still getting their fees paid for them?
Secondly,EU students aren't subject to paying fees for Scottish University whilst English and Welsh students (despite us being in the EU too..) pay full fees which seems to be 'double standards' if you ask me. I personally believe it comes down to jealously by the Scottish, and a feable attempt to try and 'get one over' on the English, purely as they fear losing their National Identity. <img src="images/smilies/angry.gif"/>
Any other views on this?

p.s. I am half Scottish and half English, although resent being half scottish, I consider myself English... <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

I posted this in another thread recently, the points I make are still valid.
It's worth nothing that the way that the Barnett Formula works, the budget cuts shall not hit Scotland for another year (at least).

Scotland has two basic issues:

1) The population is slightly poorer on average when compared to England.
Glasgow is one of, if not the poorest cities in the UK. An estimated 41% of Glasgow residents are described as in poverty. The greater
Glasgow area makes up the largest percentage of Scotland's population.

2) Scotland is not densely populated.
England: 395 people per square kilometre
Scotland: 95 people per square kilometre
Rural populations still need the infrastructure that more densely populated areas have. Although, as it is used less frequently, it costs more - as a ratio - to maintain/build as it does in heavily populated areas. England is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.

For those of you too stupid, or ignorant to compute these details - I'll do it for you.
More tax money needs to be spent in Scotland in order to maintain:
1) People - as they're poorer
2) Infrastructure - as in some areas, it's not used as much.

I'm more than happy for taxation to be spend on these things.
If it wasn't Scotland that had the highest tax spending per capita, it would just be another country. If the Scottish/English xenophobes had their way and Scotland became independent, what would happen next? Would you annex the North-East of England because too much tax is spent there?

The Scottish government's policies of: free personal care for the elderly, free university tuition and other things such as free prescriptions shall not be viable in the long term. I suspect that when the UK government budget cuts feed through to Scotland (they're delayed because of the complexities of the Barnett Formula), it'll be necessary to scrap some of these programmes.

While this is all true, the fact that the Barnett Formula calculates the grant to be great enough to provide that AND fund higher education/prescription charges etc. clearly suggests that the grant is larger than is necessary in order to fund the provision of services in the same manner as in England.
Also I find it really irritating when Scottish people say something along the lines of "it's your MPs you need to complain to, not us" - actually it's YOUR MPs we need to complain to! The majority of English MPs voted against tuition fees in England, but it was passed when Scottish MPs decided English students should pay and Scottish students shouldn't. Unfortunately as they have no accountability to anyone in England there's nothing we can do about it.
