I don't know what the economy looks like in Mass, and most of what you say I agree with, but geography plays a big part in this. For example, a one company town (there are many) where the one company closes up and moves out leaves a lot of people with similar skillsets rooted in a particular area. The cost of moving is often prohibitive for people of lower incomes so they are pretty much at the mercy of their employer. A business in this town could pretty much name its price for these workers.

But I make that argument without much conviction because, as I said, I'm undecided. I don't know enough about economics to foresee what the consequences are of leaving it as is or removing it altogether. I am curious, though. Thomas? Where are you?

Santa Fe New Mexico has a city wide minimum wage of $9.50 hr. I don't know of any studies done so far about the positive or negative results.

Considering some employers will only pay the absolute bare minimum to workers, les if they were allowed, I think minimum wage is important.

It doesn't pay enough as it is...can you imagine what some employers would do to workers if they didn't have to pay them a certain wage?

At a certain point you become a slave. You make just enough to survive to work for the boss. You exist merely to produce for the boss. Only when the worker takes action in numbers is it any different.

The best slave is a slave that doesn't know he/she is a slave. You get paid but only to give the money right back so you can work more thus working "pay check to pay check".
