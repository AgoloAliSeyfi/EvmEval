@BPScooter: I agree, there can be a fine line there. On the one hand I think there is such a thing as personal responsibility. Maybe the people involved should have thought about this a little more. But on the other hand, there *is* responsibility too.

This whole thing would be seen in a completely different light if the man in charge would have immediately reacted appropriately when things started going wrong. I would still think he was a nut case, but if instead of saying "Oh you're fine, you big babies! Tough it out!" he had said, "Wow, call 911, let's get these people some help" I could have at least had a little respect for him. He was in charge, it was up to him to show some leadership when there were cries for help. He did not do that. Now it looks like he might have to pay for that. Yeah, it's tough to be in charge. You have to try and make the best decisions that you can. The decision he made was really quite ludicrous. How he could think it would be OK to stress these people out and then put them in a hot steamy area, all crammed in there, with *plastic* on the roof for crying out loud, is beyond me. I would think it would be pretty clear to anyone with half a grip on reality that you had a situation there that was not going to end well.

And, as has been noted, real native American ceremonies are not run anything like that.

I guess if people want to go to these things, that's fine. But if the leader puts someone at risk, and that person dies, well, the leader is going to have to face the consequences. And of course, he might get off. His attorney certainly feels that Ray will get off. I wonder if the attorney will then attend one of these ceremonies? I wonder if the attorney feels *that* good about what Ray did?

I agree. I am sure his Attorney feels it was despicable what he had done.
But as you know he should and probably will represent him with the best of his abilities as a Defense Attorney. I think his best hope would be a least negligent Homicide. Well I guess he would fire me as his representative?
Have the lessor charges been taken off the table? I should follow this more closely.

Thanks for the bump, BPScooter.

The latest on this from a Google News search:

Both sides are getting ready for the August trial. Ray's lawyers said they needed more medical information and sent 10 subpoenas to get it. Prosecutors asked the judge to quash, or kill, the subpoenas.

Ray's lawyers say they found out the information they wanted was already being provided by the prosecutors. It just hadn't reached them. They offered to withdraw the subpoenas and prosecutors agreed to the withdrawal if Ray's lawyers would agree to file no more subpoenas without a court order.

Ray's lawyers said no to the second part of the offer. The judge sided with the prosecution but Ray's lawyers want him to change his mind.

Their aggravation was evident in that request, where they said the prosecutors' effort to block Ray's subpoenas is "so frivolous and lacking in merit that it can only be viewed as more gamesmanship by the state to thwart Mr. Ray's efforts to defend against this unprecedented prosecution."

I've written previously about the proposed class-action lawsuit, filed by a Tucson lawyer, on behalf of all those people who pre-paid tens of thousand of dollars, likely upward of $100,000 in total, on events that James Ray never held. He canceled those events after the sweat-lodge deaths, for which Ray later was charged with three counts of manslaughter. He's awaiting trial on those charges.

In the lawsuit (attached to this item), local lawyer Todd Jackson notes that Ray's business apparently was using the pre-paid fees to cover current costs, not holding them for the future events. And now the money is gone. In his message, Ray makes the owed money sound a bit like a communications oversight. The video's below, but here's a transcript:

Sad to say the trial will not be starting in August, it's been postponed to a 'Date to be announced'...

Trial date in AZ sweat lodge deaths case vacated

FLAGSTAFF, Ariz.  The trial date for a motivational speaker charged in the deaths of three people following a sweat lodge ceremony he led in Arizona wont start next month as planned.
James Arthur Rays trial had been scheduled to begin Aug. 31. A court document released Wednesday says the date has been vacated. No new date was set.

Thanks for the news, Graham2001, frustrating though it is.
