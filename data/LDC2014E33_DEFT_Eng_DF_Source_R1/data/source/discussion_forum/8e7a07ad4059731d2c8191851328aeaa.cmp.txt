LOL. It went completely over your head. I'll give this one more try....

Our system taxes dollars in that...it doesn't care who earns the money, but if anyone earns x dollars, they are paying a certain percentage. If you earn more one year, and less the next year, the amount you pay will change because the rate is attached to the dollars, not the person.

If the rate was attached to the person, you could earn a million dollars this year, pay X percentage of taxes and next year lets say you lose your job, go broke and make nothing, you would still be paying the same amount because the rate is attached to you, not the dollars. That's not how our system is, thankfully.

All you're saying is that an income tax is not a capitation tax. No duh? Thanks for providing no useful information to the discussion.

You still haven't explained why it's just for one person to pay a higher rate on his income than another.

I could conceive of a tax that was graduated according to the amount of melanin in your skin. You might claim it discriminates against black people, but using your logic I would just say that it doesn't tax black people, but the melanin in your skin.

Of course taxes come out of someones pocket, that's not at all what I was referring to. Whether you agree with this or not, I hope this makes sense now, but I'm not holding my breath.

I grasp exactly what you meant, that's why I said it was idiotic. There are no taxes that people don't pay. They all come out of someone's pocket. You said our system "taxes dollars, not people." What part didn't I understand?

Yet the left doesn't talk about taxing the dollar. They talk about taxing those evil, greedy, rich, 1% bastards who are stealing wealth from the average American paying their "fair share". You know, the 1% who pay 43% of federal taxes while 47% of the remaining 99% pay nothing.

Actually they do...the plans call for taxing incomes of over 1 million dollars, not specific people. The legislation never says we want to tax, Bill Gates or Ruport Murdoch, etc, specifically.

I'm glad you understand now. I expected you to insult me once you finally understood what I mean, so thanks for that.

I tried to discuss with you before about why a flat tax would hurt the lowest earners but you ignored my question. Did you not understand that one either? I really can't hold your hand through every post here. At some point, you're going to have to figure these things out on your own.
