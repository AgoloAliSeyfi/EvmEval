Again...I am not just talking about domestic demand. And I am surprised by the "Kids who don't belong there" crapola. Every American kid belongs in college.

In any case..Bush cut taxes..and lowered interest rates to zero. That..and the deregulation brought about by the loss of Glass-Steagall created a plethora of predatory loan companies. That's a real bubble.

"Every kid belongs in college" - that is a huuuge pile of dog poo.
A kid who can't (for whatever reason) hack high school in no way will be successful in higher education. That is really dumb thinking Sallow.

And another thing....the housing bubble started in the Bush admin?
C'mon...I would expect better from you than that. That is T-M and Rdean speak.

Started? No..not completely. But it went into overdrive with Bush. When Romney talked about letting some mortgages lapse to clear the market..that should have occurred at the beginning of 2001.

And kids not "hacking" high school..do so for any number of reasons..that need to be addressed. Unless there is some physical deficiency..no one is born stupid.

Sigh....it is this kind of thinking that is destroying education.
Liberals not wanting to admit that not everyone is cut out for higher education. Liberals modifying testing results because they don't like the image it presents. Liberals giving wholesale passes to minorities who are failing their class but refuse to give them failing grades, and do everything in their power to skew the grading curve so that you would practically have to rape a fellow student, in class - to fail.

BOOOOOSH!!

For Christssakes.

Barney Frank and the Dem Congress were on vacation for 8 years???

I wish you Partisan shites would fucking pay attention. Maybe if I made it Simple:

Since 1945, The Republicans only controlled BOTH the Presidency and the Senate and the HoR for FOUR (4) YEARS; during the 108th and 109th congress.

Housing and construction are the backbones of this economy. They are both showing improvement and the confidence level is improving. I think many economist may be surprised at the amount of growth we will see by year's end (2012)....or the world could come to an end.

From what I've seen or read, most economists do not expect GDP to be much higher than 2.5%, some think closer to 2% or even lower. That ain't going to translate into a hiring boom. Wish it would happen, a lotta people need a job, but I'm not seeing it.

The interesting thing is, there are MANY job openings.

So why can't they be filled?

You show me a bunch of women that worked in a bank in Atlanta, GA, and ask them to drive 18 wheelers in North Dakota during January, then I'll show you a bunch of unemployed people.

Some of the jobs are low paying manual labor that many people don't want to do, especially if they're getting a UE check. Some jobs require a specific skill that most people don't have, and again, those that do are collecting that UE check. No doubt there are other reasons as well.
