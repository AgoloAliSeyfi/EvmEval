The thing is: You can't think about having a baby for the time being, simply because of the medication, so that's one thing not to fret about for at least a year. By which time, your DMP will be finished (lucky you, I've got years left on mine <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/frown.gif"/> )

Getting married doesn't mean that you have to spend loads of money. Lots of us tend to think that we're "missing out" by not having thousands to spend on a wedding/holiday/car etc etc, but the marriage should be the important thing, not the wedding!

Buying a house is a pipe dream for whole generation now, so plenty of folk are still living their lives, having children, getting married AND renting their homes. Buying a house can sometimes be a bit of a poisoned chalice, it costs a fortune to maintain them, you're at the mercy of the bank and their interest rates and you're forever worrying about negative equity, horrid neighbours and the rising cost of insurance. As buying a house is out of the question for now, stop worrying about it and focus your attention on things that you can plan for.

For now, concentrate on your studies, you're still young and waiting a couple of years for marriage and a family is probably a good idea anyway. If you like to make long-term plans, find out how much you could be earning when you have your qualifications, by which time I guess your DMP will be nearing or at the end. Give yourself, say, 6 months after that in which to prioritise your plans, you don't HAVE to be married or a homeowner to have kids! Speak to OH, find out what his idea of your future together entails. He may just be waiting for a nudge in the right direction, just because he can't afford a decent ring, doesn't mean that you can't get engaged.

Good luck with your exams, and your DMP. And stop fretting. You've got plenty of time for the big stuff later on.

Flutterbyuk25: I was single too at 29. By 32 I was a mum and by 33 I was married. You never know what's round the corner!

exactly barbiedoll - at 30 I was very single and embarking on a dream of spending months at a time abroad, at 33 I was a mum, and at 34 I was married to baby's dad. We weren't on the property ladder, and if I'm perfectly honest and it was entirely up to me, we wouldn't ever have started on it. We didn't have a huge wedding, and I don't miss it (I remember telling my parents when I was 17 I wasn't ever getting married, and if I did they could just give me Â£50 and I'd elope).
I knew I'd be a working mum, and had no problem with that when we found out I was pregnant after a month of trying.

Not everything has to be planned down the last minute - go with the flow a bit, that way if unexpected hurdles turn up, it can be easier to roll with it <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/smile.gif"/>.
