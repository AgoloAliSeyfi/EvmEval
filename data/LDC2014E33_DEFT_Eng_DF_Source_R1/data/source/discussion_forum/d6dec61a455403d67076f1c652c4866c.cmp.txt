Why do you choose to vote for your selected party? Is it based on one key issue which you feel is more important than others or do you go for a broad range of issues?

For example, is the party's approach towards the economy (spending cuts) the priority? Or do you vote based on the social well being of the country? Or do you prioritise the environment/ immigration issues above all else?

Single issue voters are asking for trouble down the line, if you elect a party to preside over the country for the next four-five years you can't do it on the basis of one part of their ideology

A broad range. Basically their entire policy book/manifesto. Anything else is somewhat silly.

Although I didn't get to vote in the last election in the future I intend to support a party who's manefesto I agree wtih most but I believe to have achievable goals - furthermore I like to imagine what part of their manefesto they will stick to with consideration of what kind of party leader they have. Some issues are more important but I just can't choose one sorry

Well specifically policies that focus on Wales and benefiting the country. So Plaid is pretty much the only option...

A whole host of issues. The ones above (except immigration/culture) are all important but many social issues (gay rights etc) are also important to me. Luckily there's one party which I tend to agree with sufficiently that it won't be too difficult for me to decide <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

The economy. It all falls down to that.

Ultimately all other policies are irrelevant or far too similar across the board. When it comes to education, all political parties want students to have better grades whatever the level. When it comes to healthcare, all parties have committed to providing for the NHS and increasing funding and ensuring to free it from politically motivated targets. When it comes to crime, all parties talk the same spiel but do nothing in the end due to costs.

In reality, at the end of the day, all the political parties are so similar that the end result is always the same no matter how they intend to get there. Additionally, everything is so entrenched that at the end of the day nothing major is done but a few superficial tweaks are made.

More a range of issues than a single one TBH-the economy is, of course, the most importnat but I'm also influanced by a parties past and present views on social issues, on class, on equality, on enviromental protection, on the health service and so forth...
