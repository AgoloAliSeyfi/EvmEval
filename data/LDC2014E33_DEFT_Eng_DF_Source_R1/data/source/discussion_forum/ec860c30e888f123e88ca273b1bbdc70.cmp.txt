Of course they would just tariff the US right back, and then of course they could stick it to President Romney and demand the US pay its debts to China from when Bush sold America out to them.

For a private sector guy, Romney sure has the stupidest China policy of them all.

You don't just go to war with everyone you have disagreements with.

Are you actually a free trader, or is this just an opportunistic shot at Romney? IF Romney wanted a China tariff, he'd get more Democratic votes than Republican votes, and plenty of union support for such a move.

And yes, there would be a price to pay. All policies have tradeoffs.

What a statement, Obama has raised the national debt each yr by 1.5 trillion and counting. By the end of his only term he will have all by himself have added 6 trillion of our debt, seems to me it is Obama that sold us out to China. And of course you champion Obama's borrowing and spending. In fact it is Obama that has sold us out to China with more debt than any president before him, and he did it in just 4 yrs.

The New Hampshire primary is just 5 days away.

In the average of the last 4 polls there it looks like this:

Romney 40%
Paul 19%
Gingrich 11%
Huntsman 10%
Santorum 4%
Perry 2%

In two of the more recent polls, between 35-40% of NH voters say they are either "likely to change their mind" or "undecided/uncommitted".

What are your vote predictions for next Tuesday? I'm gonna ramble a bit and then reveal mine.

The consensus appears to be that Mitt Romney needs a big win in NH in order to propel him in SC since his Iowa result was almost to the vote the same total as 2008. No new support for Mitt.

In '08, Mitt finished 2nd to McCain in NH and got 32% of the vote. How much of that 40% right now is hardcore Romney support? Inexplicably, he avoided an onslaught of attacks over the last few weeks as the focus turned on Newt, but now one of the big questions becomes about what Republicans really think about the idea of Mitt cleaning up in NH and quite possibly everywhere else, too.

I think NH is a test of how comfortable or not Republicans are with Mitt as the presumptive front-runner. I think that like Iowa, he'll hold on to the support in NH he got last time. So he'll come down to earth a little bit but won't totally implode there.

Everybody needs to see the Iowa speeches. Newt's was fiery and disgruntled. He's so much more interesting when he's an attack dog and he is positioning himself now as wanting to be the fullback to Rick Santorum; if he's going down, he wants to take Romney with him, and in the meantime that'll let Santorum have a positive week and float above the fray.

Rick Santorum is leaving evangelical country and going into a 60% Catholic state. Not bad. Between hard right establishment Catholics there and that close to 40% undecided number, Santorum should be able to get into double digits.

But how high does he go? I think if Mitt comes down to the low 30's and it appears that Santorum keeps coming up and can crack 25% again, it'll be another soft-boiled Mitt non-win win.

If Newt and Santorum now represent the more traditional GOP establishment and are fighting over that share in NH, Ron Paul and John Huntsman are sharing the Independent vote.

Will Huntsman be NH's Santorum?

Ron Paul appears ready to keep cruising around 20% and another top 3 finish.

Rick Perry is totally insignificant and should have quit along with Michele Bachmann.

Romney's ahead by an average of 21%. That's going to come down to earth, but how much, and how much before it's perceived that he's falling and somebody else is rising? I think the threshold is that he needs to win by 10% in order to gain any kind of traction as the front-runner.

In Iowa, my predictions (actual results in parenthesis) were pretty close:

Santorum 27% (25)
Romney 26% (25)
Paul 22% (22)
Gingrich 9% (13)
Perry 8% (10)
Bachmann 5% (5)

That was with a day or so out. This is more of a crapshoot at this point but here goes.

Romney 32%
Santorum 25%
Paul 21%
Gingrich 11%
Huntsman 11%
Perry 1%

Ron Paul was chewed up pretty good in the debates over the weekend. I don't think he has a snowball's chance of winning in New Hampshire.

No, Romney's probably a sure thing, but both Paul and Huntsman have a shot at a close second.
