Culpability may lie elsewhere, you baggy cunt. But it is gonna to lie FIRST on BP's executives.

I'm not surprised you need to call your Mommy. Tell her someone is being mean to you, and remember, you nasty case of cunt-grease, that Sunday is Mother's Day.

Mebbe she can teach you some fucking manners too, on a remedial ed program.

Some issues are more important than your narcissistic, neurotic need to attempt to goad me, you snail slime trail-blazer, California Girl.

You are a fine one to lecture on manners, you fucking freak.

I prefer to judge on facts, not hysterical whining and the bullshit in the media. It's not my fault you're stupid so name-calling won't change the fact. You're a ranting idiot and I am not. Live with it.

However, your posts do disprove one old wife's tale "With age comes wisdom".... clearly not.

Join this topic of conversation of go fuck yourself, CaliforniaGirl. No one asked you to opine on my freaking manners...the Op is "Boycott BP", not attempt to pee in my Wheaties.

I think you need more help than a call to Mommy is likely to raise, you infected pus-filled cunt.

Go seep elsewhere.

On topic: Anyone who thinks that BP should be boycotted has an IQ smaller than their shoe size.

Off Topic: The old adage 'with age comes wisdom' is definitely not accurate.

Fuck you, you stupid blind bitch.

Great...we have our very own eco-terrorist.

and guess what boycotting BP gets you? That's right...taxpayers end up footing the bill for the clean-up. Smooth move Ex-Lax.

</quote>

Well, I'm not really sure a boycott qualifies as "terrorism"...

And didn't you say that the taxpayers were going to have to foot the bill anyway?

</quote>

boycott....no...calling for the death of the CEO.... YES! The taxpayers are already footing a portion of the bill!!!!! It's called the US Coast Guard and the US Navy being on scene and providing support...do you want them to do the entire clean up now?

</quote>

Even if no Guardsmen or sailors are killed or injured in the clean up, those men and women are directly exposed to the oil...not just on the water, but air-bourne as the wind whips up the froath. They can wear all the protective gear available but it is inevitable that they will still have some severely injuried -- injuries that will manifest in a decade or so as cancer and other diseases.

God bless the clean up workers.

FUCK UP BP CORP.!

So Madeline, do you drive a car? Use rubbermaid products? Brush your hair?

Good luck with your boycott! And don't ride the bus if you decide to stop driving.
