Oh yeah, women that make themselves completely dependent on men.

And the americans who support Sharia Law, considering in Islam Sharia Law puts women as subservient to men.

I have no problem with folks that want to voluntarily put themselves in such a position, anymore than I do with folks that want to live by Canon Law or any other religious dictates that don't interfere with secular law.

As with all religions, in America, you can quit and the State will not punish you nor allow anyone else to bring you to harm over it, though the community may shun you. That's why we have New York, LA and SF. The only punishment a religious community can exert is expulsion. Oh well.

The problem is the women in those countries dont have a choice. The muslims who support sharia law are anti-woman, anti-gay, racist bigots.

It sucks that the muslim moderates in this country and other countries don't speak out against those in their religion who still think backwards like this.

I find it hypocritical when many of the liberal minded people on this board support sharia law and that sect of the muslim faith, it bothers me to be honest.

Anyone that tells them the truth and they know they can't refute it.

I have a theory.

Misogynist Lefties use the words "twat" and "cunt" as insults because they feel sexually inferior and are actually afraid of Real Women (and they have Mommy Issues).

Thank goodness for the internet then, since the news is there for you.

<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/11/23/us-israel-nazis-idUSTRE4AM1Q420081123">(Reuters) - An Israeli court jailed eight Jewish teenagers on Sunday for carrying out neo-Nazi attacks in a case that sparked revulsion in a state that was a haven for Jews after the Holocaust.
Tel Aviv District Court Judge Zvi Gurfinkel sentenced the teenagers, aged 16 to 19, to between one and seven years in prison for a "shocking and horrifying" year-long spree of attacks that targeted foreign workers, ultra-Orthodox Jews and homeless men.</a>

Who's an idiot?
