So you've done everything; there's nothing left for you to do but sit back and wait for the end to come. All hope is lost; no options, no solutions, no answers....

Do you realize how pathetic that sounds?

You're 23 years old.
You're young, you're healthy, no mental or physical disabilities.
You're a college graduate, so you have some smarts.

I don't know what the heck you're specifically supposed to do; but I can tell you one thing - giving up and crying about how difficult and unfair life is for you and that you need someone to take care of you is not a solution. <img src="http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/cry.gif"/>

It's time you grew up, quit whining, quit looking to other people to take care of you and - FIGURE SOMETHING OUT! The government is not your your mommy and daddy to hold your hand through all life's difficulties. It's time you grew a couple and realized there are no "safety nets" in life - and the minute you start expecting someone else to be responsible for your welfare, particularly when you're young, in perfect health mentally and physically, you've abdicated all rights whatsoever to living your life on your own terms from then on.

If you put your trust in "safety nets" you'll never be a man; you'll never know what it is to be a man. You'll be a pathetic little whiner all your life, someone no one will be able to count on when times get tough or difficulties come your way. Your wife, should a woman ever want you, will not be able to depend on you for anything either, "My husband," she'll tell her friends, "the quisling is crying on the couch how unfair life is, whining that no one will take care of them." She probably will have gotten herself a job because you couldn't. She probably will pay the mortgage, make the meals, mow the lawn, clean the house, iron the clothes, fix the roof, unclog the toilet, because her husband doesn't know what to do, is waiting for someone to do it for him, or is clinging to the mail box for his "safety net" - his next pittance in the form of a government welfare check.

Inspiring.

NOT.

Frankly, I think you're better than that and I hope you'll realize that...

Hahaha. Great post. Might I add, this sounds like the perfect candidate for the Democratic Party. Being dependent on the government, and whining.

It's a sad state of a postindustrial society -- we're all a nation of overspecialized workers, trained like insects to be good at one thing, and that's about it.

Stop putting words in my mouth and stop trolling.

No, that was strictly me - and yeah, I was harsh - if I offended anyone, I apologize, but I wasn't speaking to "all the folk out of work" - I was speaking to a healthy, educated, 23 year-old male who is, IMHO, on the verge of becoming a whiny little loser if he doesn't get over his victim-hood and do something about his situation.

Of all the people out there who are out of work, looking for work, struggling to stay at work, he is the least incapable of doing something about his situation, and the least incapable of being successful at it. But if he sees his only solution, his only 'salvation' as being a handout from government, and the government is eager to hand out welfare to this healthy, educated, 23 year-old male, then there is no solution but to take the government's charity.

That he thinks he can't find work is utterly bogus. What he might not be able to find is work he wants to do, work which suits his new diploma and certification or some other sensitivity. I've no idea what prompted him to pursue that particular career, but he did and whether it was a poor decision or not is immaterial; he made it and now he needs to live with it.

If he can't find work, then the "safety net" is immaterial too - it simply isn't big enough or strong enough - nor can it be made to be either. And perhaps that's how dire things have become..

He has every right to be worried about what happens when his pot runs dry; because from the sounds of it, it's a virtual certainty it will.

You're not understanding what I'm asking. I'm talking logistics. The fact of the matter is that right now there are more people looking for jobs than jobs available. If 1 person finds a job, 10 people won't find a job. Literally, what do you expect to happen to these people without the social safety nets that are in place? I would expect that out homeless population and crime rates would skyrocket, but that's just me. These issues go beyond "suck it up," as there are side effects when despite best efforts people don't make their next rent check.
