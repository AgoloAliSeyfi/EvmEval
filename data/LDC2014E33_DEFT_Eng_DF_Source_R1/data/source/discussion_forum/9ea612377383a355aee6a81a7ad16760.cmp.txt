What so if a business needs to borrow, they just should fail, huh?

</quote>

if it needs to borrow to stay afloat...yes...it should fail for its business model is flawed or it would have the capital to stay afloat when times are lean.

It simply means it will ultimately fail with even MORE debt if it borrows to stay afloat
If it needs to borrow to expand....then yes...it should borrow.

I was against the GM bailout. It was unfair to Ford who had a soloid business model.

GM blew it and it was rewarded.

Okay, so what should Obama have done for small businesses, in your opinion?

Day one he should have told them thatthe Bush Tax Cuts woulkd be extended to all.

He should not have cherry picked who got stimulus money.....for any small business trying to compete with another small business that got money had no shot in hell. The stimulus should never have been instituted.

He should have announced on day one that the whole cap and trade thing will not pass under his watch....

He should have thanked all business owners for their perseverence and hard work...not viliified them.

He should have done one of two things....either wait until next term to pass healthcare...or allowed business owners to know exactly what it will cost them...something many of them still cant figure out and wont be able to figure out for 2 more years.

Thats a start.

He extended the Bush tax cuts

That is part of being a democrat. Therefore, there are two sides to the issue.

The private sector saw an increase of 2.5 million jobs under the stimulus.

Villified them? That is complete hyperbole.

You may have a point about the healthcare bill.

Obama IS NOT helping the economy to recover, he is slowing its growth

It affects small businesses, sure.

That's where most jobs originate unless your flipping burgers.

True, but Obama has done a lot for small businesses:

1) He extended loan programs for small businesses.

2) He established an initiative for small businesses in rural areas.

3) He was half successful in trying to eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses.

4) Create a $3000 tax credit for businesses adding jobs

5) Raise the small business investment expensing limit to a quarter of a million.

He is in bed with unions &amp; the big business who employ them. He hates small business because they tend to be non union &amp; harder for the IRS to track tax revenue.</a>

The thing about biased sources is basically this: "That may be true, but so is this..."

Therefore, I don't take sources like that seriously.
