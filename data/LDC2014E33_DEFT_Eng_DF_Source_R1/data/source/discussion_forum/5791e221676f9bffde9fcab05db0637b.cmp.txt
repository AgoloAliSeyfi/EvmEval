I am not blaming non compromise on anyone. That is my position, and guess what... Hard to believe as it is. Im independent and havent voted for a repub since 2004.

Funny thing is you said "It's like the more shenanigans the libtards play, the less willing people are to seek middle ground at all."

I don't see any reference as a counterpoint the shenanigans by social authoritarians to deny same-sex couples equal treatment under the law. When one blames one side and ignores the other, that's usually indicative of - well - blaming one side.

Personally I wish all of them the best.

Politically they can kiss my ass. If you cant leave me alone, I wont leave you alone.

I am an asshole that way.

</quote>

So people that are being denied equal treatment under the law aren't supposed to try to correct that.

You are probably just a good guy, they are the assholes for their expectations.

Discrimination is discrimination. I dont know what more I can add. I am and have always been the guy that pushes back. The guy never afraid to kick the table over. In doing so you usually get quicker resolution.

It's not based on gender.
It's about a very unhealthy and harmful lifestyle.

</quote>

What makes it unhealthy and harmful is the hatred directed at gays

</quote>

No it's the disease called aids.

</quote>

Then you support gay marriage for lesbians then...because you heteros have a WORSE record on AIDS than we do.

1. So you are cool with lesbians getting a Civil Marriage because they have the lowest incidence of HIV infection? (Or is it just homosexual males you have an issue with [which takes it back to being gender specific].)

2. Would you support HIV testing as part of Civil Marriage requirements for all participants and the refusal of a license if an individual tests positive for HIV? (Or is it just homosexual males you have an issue with [which takes it back to being gender specific].)
See testing everyone for HIV and then refusing a Civil Marriage license would not be discriminatory based on gender.

P.S. You realize there are more heterosexuals with HIV/AIDS infections then homosexuals, right?

When AIDS first appeared it was spread by gay men amongst each other. Then it spread to straight people via bisexual sex and shared needles. Today many more straight people than gays have HIV/AIDS.

All are unhealthy lifestyles.

</quote>

AIDS first appeared in Africa and it was not gay men....but feel free to continue your little bugaboo.

"I am adhering to what I've said since this bill was first introduced Â— an issue of this magnitude and importance, which requires a constitutional amendment, should be left to the people of New Jersey to decide,"

Seems like he wants the people to make the decision. And you have a problem with this?

</quote>

Yes, you cant violate anothers constitutional rights, voting like prop 8 in cali was just that.im not sure how many times this has to be told to you people, but seriously buy a clue.

</quote>

Can you point me to the part of the constitution that gives you a right to marry? Because I have yet to find it anywhere in there. You are the one who is clueless. You cannot claim that what you consider to be a human or civil right is also a constitutional right, it does not work that way.

</quote>

It's right next to the part that gives YOU the right to marry.

As I recall, Wallace was doing quite well for the nomination in 1972, until someone shot him.

Then the Democrats had a collective brain fart and nominated McGovern....

</quote>

Wallace did not run as a Democrat. They rejected him and what he stood for.

</quote>

He did in 1972; go look it up.

</quote>

You are correct, in 1972, he ran as a Democrat AFTER repudiating Segregation. in 1968, while still supporting segregation, he ran as the American Independent Party candidate.
