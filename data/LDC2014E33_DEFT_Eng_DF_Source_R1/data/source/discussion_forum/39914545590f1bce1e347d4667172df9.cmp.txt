I love how reuters calls them 'migrants' in the title, and illeagal aliens in the actual story.

What I found interesting was the law may actually work, the illeagals are talking about leaving, which is what Arizona wanted.

Funny how that works out isn't it, upholding the law is 'racist'.

upholding the law isn't what's racist. putting people who are LEGALLY here in fear of being stopped and arrested if they don't have papers IS.

and no offense, hon, but when tom tancredo and al sharpton agree something goes too far, you're on the wrong side.

it particularly amuses me when 'small government types' want the police to be able to stop you and demand papers.

So it's racist if the police ask an Hispanic person if they're here legally? I wouldn't call that racism.

Since the law has passed, my hope is that this will force the federal government to revamp and enforce immigration law. They've clearly failed in their duties. And once this happens, Arizona can get rid of this stupid law.

I think most will try California and if they can't get work there, return to Mexico. For once they feel they are not wanted if they came here illegally.

They will go where there is work. As long as we dont enforce the law that restricts employers to employ them, they will stay here.

if the police think you have committed a crime and you fit the description of the person they know committed the crime....don't the police have the right to stop you and question you.....

and why does everyone think the police are going to stop every non-white person they see....

i would guess the police will go out of their way to be careful.....
