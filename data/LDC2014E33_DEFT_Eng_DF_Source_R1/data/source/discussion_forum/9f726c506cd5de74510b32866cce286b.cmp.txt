The reason England won't let go of Scotland is purely financial.

- In 2008 London took £12.9 billion from Scotland in oil and gas revenues.

- 15% of oil and gas revenues of the Scottish sector of the North Sea which was previously attributed to the Scottish economy, £2.2 Billion in 2008, is now being attributed to the English economy. This amount of money is more than the proposed public sector cuts per year as experts forecast that Westminster will after the Holyrood elections, cut the Scottish budget by £35 Billion over the next 15 years which equate to £2.16 Billion per year. Scotland will give London a minimum of £225 billion over the next 15 years in oil and gas revenues alone.

- Scotland is the World's leading producer of wind energy, this energy will bring in more revenue and development opportunities than oil and gas.

- Scotland could build 2 High Schools or 16 wind turbines or 300 stream turbines or 256 two bedroom houses with a single day's Scottish Oil revenue, if the Scot's did not give it ALL TO LONDON.

- Scotland gets NO Oil Revenues - Scotland is funded only by some population taxes.

- 250,000 tonnes of low radioactive London Olympic waste was dumped in Falkirk.

The list goes on and on and on and on...

TCD, Scotland has it better than the rest of the UK?

"25% of Scotland's Children some 522,000 live in persistant poverty" I wouldn't exactly say that was BETTER!

It's true we have FREE uni but guess what, you could have kept yours less expensive too. But you guys tripled it. Who to blame? Scotland? Nice try.

Scotland gets a central grant for the UK treasury. The UK treasury is funded by oil, amongst various other sources of taxation. So yes, Scotland does receive oil revenues.

as much revenue as if it were independent? Come on England, bring a half decent, sensible arguement to the table!

Let me just make this clear. I don't hate the English in any shape or form. However, I do hate people who say that we're leeches, that we don't contribute, and that'd we default if we became independent.
