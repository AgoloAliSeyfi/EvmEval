First off, the fact that health care costs so much and that so many people have to have insurance, (which was originally created to be only for catastrophic situations) just to walk into a doctor's office is because the government's overinvolvement in health care.

But that's for a whole other discussion

Government has restricted market forces from weeding out insurance companies who act out as you stated by preventing people from purchasing insurance across state lines. This created an artificial monopoly where costs go up and coverage grows poorer. Open up access and competition increases. Increased competition means lower cost and better coverage for everyone.

Should people have recourse if the insurance company screws the person over by not providing an agreed upon paid for service? Yes!
In a free market these companies will go out of business real fast.

Should the government mandate what services an insurance company provides? No.

Government is not the solution, its the problem.
But that's just my opinion as is yours that the government is the solution. OK, we disagree.

i think when the free market fails to provide an adequate service such a basic health care at an affordable price government intervention can force change. since the majority of people on this thread have basically decided that access to affordable health care is not a basic right and people do not deserve it, this rules out universal health (unlike most of the rest of the industrialized world). this being said, government regulation of this can provide a framework to make it accessible by more people than it currently it.

government is not always the solution, but neither is the free market. just use the financial markets betwen 2004 and 2008 as an example of this.

If the insurance industry operated in a regulated free market there would be little or any threat of the horrors of dropped coverage,etc because the market would weed out bad actors. Not only that, prices would fall as insurance companies would lose their protected markets. People would have more choice. They could shop for the kind of coverage they wish to buy.
And if you or anyone else thinks Obamacare's mandate that pre existing conditions must be covered is going to work, your nuts. Private insurers will simply stop writing health coverage and will of course drop existing insureds when their policies expire.
Of course this is the goal of Obamacare. To create a system where the only insurer available if the federal government. Obama gets his wish for socialized medicine. And we get shitty rationed care by doctors who are from third world countries, can barely speak English and are more likely to screw up.

If they operated in a free market why were they required to cover so many different things under penalty of law?

The Catholic Church is opposed to contraception for moral reasons.

Where is the morality in creating a life when food and clean water are rare commodities? Where poverty exists and educational opportunities are non existent?

Where is the morality when disease is spread?

Where is the morality when a women is the victim of domestic violence? When a women is forced to conceive and then trapped as the child become a lever to gain more power and more control?

I don't know what God thinks about it and will not lie and tell you I do know.
I think that birth control should remain legal as even if it is wrong,
the person has the right to chose to do it any way.
I am not for it or against, I am not a woman though.

I do believe that abortion is a sin as I see it as murder, which is why I am lead to believe that birth control should not be thought of as wrong as it could save a person from committing a sin by having to have an abortion. Where if they had been taking birth control they never would have had to commit a sin.
