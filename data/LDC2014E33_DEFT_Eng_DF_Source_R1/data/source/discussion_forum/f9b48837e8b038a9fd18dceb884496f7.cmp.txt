Louboutins, Springstein and smart stuff. We are a shining example of how conservatives and liberals can rub along pretty well.... when we get our priorities straight. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Now just wait one single minute, here! I mean, I can tolerate Jillian liking Springstein because sometimes I have to overlook the bad when there is lots of good and I knew that from the get go.

But you? You like Springstein, too? I'm getting blindsided by this news.

I have to make an exercise in more tolerance, now.

*must recover from such news*

Getting too political but I became a Spingsteen/Patti Smith fan in college. I wanted to make sure I referenced the correct person.

These people are swine. I can't find the words. I'll just get you the link. And when ever you hear anyone from our side say we have to reach out and work with anyone on the left, I hope you're close enough to give that person a freaking knuckle sandwich.

According to The Daily Caller,

Although the news of Andrew Breitbarts death is still fairly fresh, the merry band of faceless marauders at the Daily Kos have decided it is time to use his death as an opportunity to make political hay.

A post dated March 1 by dragon82a, titled Lets Help Andrew Breitbart go out In Style..Get Westboro Baptist Church to Protest Him encourages readers to post on the Westboro Baptist Churchs Facebook page calling for the group to protest Andrew Breitbarts funeral:

Here is the Facebook of the WestBoro Baptist Church:

Send them a message anything will do, about how much publicity they would get by Protecting Andrew.

<a href="http://www.facebook.com/">http://www.facebook.com/</a>

Lets give back to Andrew what he has so generously given to us all these years.

We could call this Operation Sendaway

eh... but it's ok for a rightwingnut cow to wish a presidential candidate to be killed in a terrorist attack because she doesn't like his politics, right?

think skinned... righties. keep on whining.

Jillian please, no rightwinger has EVER said that, because then we would get stuck with Joe Hair Plugs and even 1 hours of a Biden Presidency scares us more than a 2nd Obama term! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>
