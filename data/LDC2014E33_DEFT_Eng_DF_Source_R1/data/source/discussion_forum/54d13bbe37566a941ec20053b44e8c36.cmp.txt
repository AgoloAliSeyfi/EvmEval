Random men approaching you in the street asking you personal questions and stalking you?

Sometimes I could be walking in the street, minding my own ****ing business when a random bloke, usually foreign and black will ask me questions such as &amp;quot; Hello, whats your name? Where do you live? Do you have a boyfriend?&amp;quot; and sometimes just &amp;quot;Hi, how are you?&amp;quot; as if we know each other or something. Yesterday I was walking in the rain with my umbrella, wearing modest clothing (jeans, baseball jacket, Converses) when some random guy just starts talking to me like we know each other. <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/> The day before some chavvy looking bloke comes out of a store as I was walking past and nods his head at me like we know each other, and as I walked he kept turning around and then stopping in the middle of the street at some point. But the worst experience I've ever encountered was when I was 11, on my way to school one day when some guy asks me where a tube station is. So I say I dont know because I dont and walk away and he keeps following me and asks again. I say I dont know and then he proceeds to ask me personal questions. He asks me if I'm off to school and I say yes, then he asks me where I live, what my name is, etc. I tell him I dont speak to strangers but then I tell him I'm 11 in the hope that he'd back off but he didnt. He countined to follow me as I walked to the bus stop then said that he'd just like to know where x station is and that I &amp;quot;dont need to be afraid&amp;quot;. I tell him that I told him repeatedly that I dont know where the bloody station is and he just kept following me. What made things worse was that it was difficult to get help from anyone in the street because they thought that he knew me. <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/>

I know some girls have experienced worser situations before, so I'd like to hear your experiences with this type of behaviour.

I live out in LA at the moment and i get this allll the time. Especially mexican guys. Ive had men come up and whisper in my ear, smell me and sit next to me on the bus asking me personal questions... its not nice. The best thing to do is to be very blunt and just tell them you arnt interested and to not talk to you and then just ignore them or go find a normal looking guy to stand near/pretend to be with.

Yeah. My old school is quite a well known known one in my town. It has a very distincitive green uniform. Some old pervy guy one asked me if I was wearing green knickers. It wasn't a games afternoon, so I wasn't.

I got approached by a man in a shop believed to be in his 60's. The things he said was absolutely dispicable!

About

Hollaback! is a movement dedicated to ending street harassment using mobile technology. Street harassment is one of the most pervasive forms of gender-based violence and one of the least legislated against. Comments from âYouâd look good on meâ to groping, flashing and assault are a daily, global reality for women and LGBTQ individuals. But it is rarely reported, and itâs culturally accepted as âthe price you payâ for being a woman or for being gay. At Hollaback!, we donât buy it.

We believe that everyone has a right to feel safe and confident without being objectified. Sexual harassment is a gateway crime that creates a cultural environment that makes gender-based violence OK. There exists a clear legal framework to reproach sexual harassment and abuse in the home and at work, but when it comes to the streetsâall bets are off. This gap isnât because street harassment hurts any less, itâs because there hasnât been a solution. Until now. The explosion of mobile technology has given us an unprecedented opportunity to end street harassmentâand with it, the opportunity to take on one of the final new frontiers for womenâs rights around the world.

By collecting women and LGBTQ folksâ stories and pictures in a safe and share-able way with our very own mobile phone applications, Hollaback! is creating a crowd-sourced initiative to end street harassment. Hollaback! breaks the silence that has perpetuated sexual violence internationally, asserts that any and all gender-based violence is unacceptable, and creates a world where we have an optionâand, more importantlyâa response.

Although some of these incidents may not seem serious, it can be terrifying and humiliating to be approached by a man in this way and feel powerless to do anything about it.

I AM a lesbian but I would NEVER mention it in these situations... I think it would make them perv even more.
