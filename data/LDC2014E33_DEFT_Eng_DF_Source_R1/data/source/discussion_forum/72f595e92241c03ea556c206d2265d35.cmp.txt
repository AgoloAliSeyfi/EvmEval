In Roswell, NM, an event occurred that may have been someone finding a weather balloon made from aluminium coated cloth or something similar. It became a big story with many different people making many different claims about aliens, alien bodies, alien spaceships, Area 51, alien autopsies, secret labs, Air Force cover-ups, Men In Black, etc etc etc.

Even today people believe that it was the US Government covering up an alien spacecraft crashing on Planet Earth. The Government took measures to hide the truth from the general public for whatever reason and the truth is supposedly still being hidden. People who believe that it is a cover up also think the movie "Independence Day" is a documentary.

That is a Conspiracy Theory. Big "C" Big "

When Walter Ego and I spent 3 hours discussing our plan to rob a local bank, knowing full well we intend to attempt such a crime, that is a conspiracy. Little "c".

When a group of people believe something is very different from what the media and the government tell them it is, that group has a THEORY that they are being lied to. They think that the media, the government and big businesses have entered into a CONSPIRACY to lie to them in order to cover up the truth for whatever reason that suits the media, government and big businesses who may be involved.

That is a Conspiracy Theory.

My question (restated here and slightly paraphrased) is has there ever been a CT that was discovered to be TRUE?

I offer Watergate as an example of such. Denials were made that the GOP and the office of the President had no connections with the break ins. Some people felt differently, they thought the truth was being hidden and it was. Others chose to believe Nixon when he said "I am not a crook."

Some members of the president's staff were indited and sent to prison for perjury and other offenses. I think Watergate is a prefect example of what I am asking about.

I wonder how many times a CT has trued out to be true because I have a theory that such events are few and far between. They are almost never encountered because people who know the truth will tell someone. They will take photos of dead aliens, they will record their friends telephone conversations they will make a deal with the prosecutors to avoid prison or get shorter terms in prison. The truth will come out eventually because once more than one person knows the truth, it is no longer a secret.

Some "Truthers" think the people on the airplanes on 9/11 are alive and rich, living in Europe. Some think Flight 93 never crashed. Some think no planes hit the Twin Towers.

Substitute 9/11 with Holocaust, Moon Landings, Vaccinations, or whatever else you have.

Consider how many people would be involved in such cover ups. Why has no one come forward to admit the truth?

Because the truth is already known.

You do realize in the United States we can vote for anyone of any party or of no party at all, right? <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

Got close to 19% of the popular vote, and finished in third place despite having withdrawn from the race.

Once again, where's the CT proven true in this?

And what happened to that lie you were going to cite in Cristol's book?
