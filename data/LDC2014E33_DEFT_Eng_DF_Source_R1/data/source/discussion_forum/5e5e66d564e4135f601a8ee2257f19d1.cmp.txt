5. I call Bull Shit on this one

I want to see proof. We have been hand fed so much scare tactic crap up to this point that this seems another attempt at "Hey, maybe this will scare the pussies off". Next thing will be the police having to protect the protestors from bombs while they pepper spray them. Give me a break.

Real bombers explode things.

7. I know. You don't like the idea of a wingnut asshole trying to kill innocent people.

None of us do.

But let me get this right: Because the bombs didn't kill anyone, there was no threat?

9. Not about my likes/dislikes

Threat undetermined. Not willing to accept word of reporter. Were there in fact, any bombs at all?

Many more scare tactics around than bombs.

11. So, you just choose whether to believe something or not regardless of substance?

That's kind of a 'wingnut' thing.

Here's the exact quote: "Saleh said the Topeka Police Departments bomb squad was called to investigate the pickup after an officer saw suspicious objects inside. He says they found explosives made with household materials and designed to spray shrapnel upon detonation.

Are you saying that the Topeka PD did NOT find what was reported?

I know this might be hard for you to grasp, but in the really real world, you can call the Topeka PD and find out for yourself. Then you can say that you called and they told you they found bombs, and then we can say that you're lying too.

We can play the same 'reality trick' on you that you're playing right now. But then nothing is true, is it?

22. Read "The Assault on Reason"

It's happening all over this nation, and here on DU.

Those that employ reason are roundly admonished for being 'arrogant' or 'condescending'. It amazes me how people can just construct any reality they want and then <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/101446214#post86">try to impose it</a> on others. I can't let that sort of thing stand, and all I seem to get is derision in response.

31. well, here... let me applaud you for it

I'd rather have reason and be "arrogant/condescending" than to not have reason and live disconnected from reality. Lies kill. A person who willfully lives disconnected from reality will always fail.

25. Of what

Am I trying to convince you? I'm expressing my own views here. What you believe is of concern only in terms of debate. And possibly adding to my knowledge if I'm convinced there's justification. So far, NOT.

If that article represents the final word on "substance" to you, that's fine with me. I am, and remain skeptical. I'm sure they found something. Hard to make any case at all without something tangible. What it is, who put it there, and why remain, for me, unknown, and also remain deciding factors for me.

Wingnut/Hard for me to grasp. Goodness, disagreeing with you causes personal attacks. Not hard to believe when considering the weakness of your argument.

28. Why do you assume that the Topeka PD is accurately representing what was found?

All other motivations aside, it is RIDICULOUSLY easy for an organization like that to want to cover their asses by claiming they found something, or exaggerating, or simply not correcting false initial reports. Particularly when you consider that that quote, including the bit about "spraying shrapnel," is not found ANYWHERE in the actual news story this blogger linked to--it appears to have been completely made up by the blogger.

21. I'm curious, what other 'scare tactic crap' have we 'been fed'?

You're trying to classify this as 'crap' and using the 'justification' that it's another in a long string of 'crap'. So where's all this 'crap'.

24. Broad heading

For reporting of terrorist activity at levels that justify recent legislation such as the Patriot act. For creating a new intrusive Department of homeland security. For the recent legislation restricting internet activity to fight "piracy". New proposal to fly drones over the US...

1. Assassination of U.S. citizens. 2. Indefinite detention. 3. Arbitrary justice. 4. Warrantless searches. 5. Secret evidence. 6. War crimes. 7. Secret court. 8. Immunity from judicial review. 9. Continual monitoring of citizens. 10. Extraordinary renditions.

I knew something was up when my dad helped me understand what Secretary McNamara was telling Congress about the Gulf of Tonkin. Been skeptical ever since.

27. Ah. It was not clear to me what you meant.

So you are saying that this might have been an intimidation ploy against OWS?

That may have merit.

I took you to mean that there was no plot at all and the story was fake. Now I understand.

One day it could happen. And we still won't know for sure if it was a "lone nut" or set up to scare others from protesting.

18. There is some question as to whether

protesters or the Gov. was the putative target of this bomb, but given where the truck was located, it is much more likely they would have been injured had the bombs exploded.

When someone planted a bomb at an MLKing march a few years ago, it wasn't too hard to figure out who it was supposed to intimidate...
