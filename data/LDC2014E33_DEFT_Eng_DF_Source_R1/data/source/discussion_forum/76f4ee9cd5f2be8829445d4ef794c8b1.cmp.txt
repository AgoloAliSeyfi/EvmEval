So handle them the same way we handle the freaks that harass women going into clinics - establish a mandatory buffer zone around the site and let them spew whatever they want from outside that perimeter.

It worked in the Snyder case. The WBC assholes were kept a few hundred yards away, they got to wave their little signs and the family never even knew they were there.

I can see mebbe clarifying when someone becomes a "public figure" for purposes of libel and slander law -- but even that is a stretch, as I am not persuaded anything the WBC wrote on its signs or shouted at passers by could be legally regarded as libelous.

Beyond that, I am not convinced the SCOTUS can find anything new to say about the First Amendment on these facts. "Harrassment" is a matter of criminalizing conduct, not speech.....I doubt the Synder family could have filed a police report on the WBC for any harrassment type crime in connection with their son's funeral.

How can a reasonable person be "put in fear, etc." by a protest they were not aware of until the paper reported on it the next day?

Actually if you read the decision the Snyders were awarded $2.9 million (reduced to $2.1million) not because of the newspaper coverage, but because Mr. Snyder sought out and watched the WBC's "documentary" video of the protest on their website. True story. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/thup.gif"/>

The 4th Circuit used Milkovich as their primary case with Cantwell quoted as the secondary.

But what they actually overturned the District on was sending the question of law as to whether the speech should have First Amendment protection to the jury rather than deciding it from the bench - which is what they did by focusing on type of speech rather than nature of speaker and audience and concluded it was protected. The only problem may be that they used New York Times in their tort analysis after saying public v. private didn't matter.

The concurrence at the Circuit level also raises the (valid, IMO) point of lack of sufficient evidence to prove harm but on an amicus waiver, over which there seems to be some confusion. That's an interesting side issue that may be addressed.

Cool stuff. Here's the 4th Circuit decision if you haven't read it. It's a pdf but you don't need PACER access:

Have you read the 4th Circuit opinion and the transcript of yesterday's questioning? It seems the Court is looking at whether the 4th Circuit was correct in disregarding the public v. private nature of the individuals and event and focusing on the type of speech instead. There's also a side issue of amicus waivers. Interesting stuff if you haven't looked at it.

The attorney for the church is the daughter of the nut case pastor.
The public v. private nature is THE argument for the church as the ruling in the Jerry Fallwell v. Hustler case is what they are hanging their entire argument on.
How they can claim the father of the soldier is a public figure is absurd. That is the entire case. The father IS NOT a public figure and is a private citizen.
The jury verdict must stand.

</quote>

Actually what they're arguing if you read it closely is that Hustler should be expanded to private individuals, or conversely that the definition of public figure should be changed to include anyone who has personal information available publicly - in this case, through the deceased's obituary. Why they dropped the sufficient evidence objection and it had to be raised on amicus is beyond me, that's the key to the entire case. The WBC people were never suspected to be all that bright though.

ETA: On the other hand, the Snyders are arguing they were a captive audience at the funeral, when they testified they never even knew the WBC was there during the funeral. Both sides could have used better attorneys on this, the arguments dance around the real issues and ignore the facts - on both sides.

Of course they are because without the "expansion" they have no argument. However, they argued yesterday that TV interviews the father gave "expanded" the father to a piblic figure from a private one de facto.
