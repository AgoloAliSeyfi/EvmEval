This genuinely makes me sad. Racism is a belief or doctrine that inherent differences among the various human races determine cultural or individual achievement, usually involving the idea that one's own race is superior and has the right to rule others. This is evident in all groups, cultures and races throughout the globe. To state that racism is in white peoples blood is to effectively ignore the atrocities committed by virtually every other race in the world. What about Rwanda and the Hutu and the Tutsi? Stalin and the purges? Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein and Idi Amin? Just because a crime, based on discrimination, is committed against someone who may have a similar skin tone does that make it less despicable?

Discrimination is essentially an evolutionary throwback, and everyone will be guilty of it to some extent in their lives. India and the Caste system, class discrimination in the UK and inter-group discrimination are but a few examples. Instead of focusing on the perceived differences between races try and find the root of your anger. By stating that 'white' people are inherently different to 'black' people you are indeed succumbing to racism, which to all intents and purposes, is hypocritical.

As for the BNP and the EDL these are in my opinion minority groups born out of ignorance and swelled by frustration. The EDL are indeed violent and their popularity helped by media images of Islamic fundamentalists protesting against soldiers returning from service in Afghanistan and Iraq, which in a country with a strong military history and history of pride in the Armed Forces was bound to inflame a disenchanted, unemployed and in many instances poorly educated youth. Which, essentially, is what the EDL are. The BNP are a far more dangerous organisation. Insidious in their operations and now validated by acknowledgement by the BBC and political system they are a threat to this country and the very values that Britain should be proud of. For we are indeed the most multi-cultural and forward thinking nation in Europe. Dont believe me? The Burkha ban in France? 1970's UK style racism in Italy and Spain?

So, regarding these occurances, do you think EDL will ever make a mark in history? Because, even though they're portrayed by the media in such a negative manner, they still stand firmly.

Missed an 'e'.

And your point is? I am more than happy to defend the EDL, you mad bro?

The BNP are not however, violent today, to the best of my knowledge, and that is what judgement of them as a political party should be based on. Not their transition from NF to BNP in the early 90's. Yes, they have a rather sordid past, but at some point you have to judge on current merits, not decades old acts. Besides, there is enough to make the BNP a joke now, without trying to resort to alleged links to C-18 and that sort of thing.

Are you telling me i was right in saying that you are part of the EDL? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/eyebrow.gif" alt=":eyebrow:"/>
If so, that is disgustingly disgusting tbh.
Also, it's difficult to be an EDL nerd, as those who are intelligent know perfectly well that their beliefs are not thought out very well.
