Wow, you Republicans are really into denial. Okay here it is. Proof!

Obama:

"The Budget Control Act that I signed into law last month will cut annual Government spending by about $1 trillion over the next 10 years. It also charges the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction with finding an additional $1.5 trillion in savings. As part of this jobs bill, I am asking the Congress to increase that amount so that it covers the full cost of the American Jobs Act. In addition, I believe that the Congress should seize the opportunity that this new Committee presents and do much more so that we can put the country on a sustainable fiscal path, which is critical for our long-term economic growth and competitiveness. For this reason, I am sending to the Congress this detailed plan to pay for this jobs bill and realize more than $3 trillion in net deficit reduction over the next 10 years. Combined with the approximately $1 trillion in savings from the first part of the Budget Control Act, this would generate more than $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade. This would bring the Nation to the point where current spending is no longer adding to our debt and where our debt is no longer increasing as a share of our economy--an important milestone on the way to restoring fiscal discipline and moving us toward balance." [Living Within Our Means and Investing in the Future: The President's Plan for Economic Growth and Deficit Reduction, WhiteHouse.gov, September 2011]

There you go. Can't argue with facts. However, it should be noted that many democrats didn't support the bill either. I never said democrats shouldn't be to blame for impeding Obama. Contrary to what Fox News will tell you, Obama is on the center of the political spectrum. He has been criticized by Democrats for being too diplomatic.

In other words, don't blame Obama. Blame ALL of congress.

parroting a bunch of comments on the the White House website is not 'proof' of anything other than it was 'promised'.

Do you have the actual bill he proposed, showing the savings mentioned above?

I did not "parrot" a bunch of comments together. That is an exact quote taken directly from whitehouse.gov. Come on, is it really that hard to believe? It's right there in front of you.

I did not say 'parrot a bunch of comments together', implying you'd mixed a bunch of stuff together... you read my comment incorrectly.

I said. parroting something from the White House website doesn't count as proof that Obama ever actually submitted what the comments promised.

I want a link to the bill, House or Senate, that Obama introduced, which 'would' be considered proof.

Is that so hard for you to understand?

What exactly would stop Obama from sending it to the Congress? He didn't say he was in the process of making the bill. The bill was already finalized. He sent the bill and it was rejected.

I guess will look for the proof that he sent the bill to congress, but I don't understand why you need that level of proof. Where do I even look for something like that?

Okay, here is the next best thing. An outside news article confirming it. It's amazing how easy it is to find this stuff with a simple google search. You should try it sometime.
