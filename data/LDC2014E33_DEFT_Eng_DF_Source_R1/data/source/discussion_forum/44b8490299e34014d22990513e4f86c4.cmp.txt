There's no TRUTH is this pile of shit.

She never did. Not once. That did not stop Rush from saying things like this: Rush said she has boyfriends " Lined up around the block."

He said she said " she was having so much sex she can't afford it."

He asked: "...what does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a prostitute. She wants to be paid to have sex. She's having so much sex she can't afford the contraception.

And: "Ms. Fluke, have you ever heard of not having sex? Have you ever heard of not having sex so often?"

After saying that the Washington, D.C., Department of Health "will send you free condoms and lube," Limbaugh said: "So, Ms. Fluke and the rest of you feminazis, here's the deal. If we are going to pay for your contraceptives, and thus pay for you to have sex, we want something for it, and I'll tell you what it is. We want you to post the videos online so we can all watch."

Rush asked of Ms. Fluke: "Who bought your condoms in junior high? Who bought your condoms in the sixth grade? Or your contraception. Who bought your contraceptive pills in high school?"

Then: Fluke is "having so much sex, it's amazing she can still walk." He also said Georgetown should establish a "Wilt Chamberlin scholarship... exclusively for women."

Then, again, Limbaugh defended his previous comments and complained "not one person says that, ' Well, did you ever think about maybe backing off the amount of sex that you have?'

Later, Limbaugh said that requiring insurance companies to cover contraception is "no different than if somebody knocked on my door that I don't know and said, 'You know what? I'm out of money. I can't afford birth-control pills, and I'm supposed to have sex with three guys tonight.' "
Fluke never even once talked about her own sexual activity. In, no way, shape or form. In fact, in her testimony, she even said:

And so, Im here today to share their voices, and I want to thank you for allowing them  not me  to be heard."

All that came from his mouth was a 3 day long tirade of misogynistic putrid slurs and below-the-belt slander aimed at a woman who testified about a public policy matter.

There wasn't an ounce of truth in his words.

By her behavior Fluke proved the absolute truth of what he said. She wants birth control coverage to the tune of $1,000 a year. As has been ABUNDANTLY made clear, to use that much BC, she has to be having sex so often that it's a wonder how she is getting through school. But that's a matter between the school and the professors.

</quote>

There's no behavior she engaged in, other than testifying in Washington.

And you have got to be as rock solid stupid as Rush and his dittohead idiots to make a statement like "to use that much birth control."

You fucking dolts don't even understand how the pill works. You take ONE pill a day - if you have no sex, or if you have sex 10 times a week. The cost of the pill has nothing to do with the amount of sex one has.

Christ, some of you have the IQ of lint.

If you are not having sex, but choose to instead DEDICATE your time instead towards maintaining a 4.0 GPA average, you don't need contraception do you? Doesn't take much intelligence to figure that out. Get off the free lazy entitlement train, and live up to paying for your own choices in responsibility.

So, your point is that, rather than presenting herself as a slut, she is presenting herself as the 'Voice of the Sluts"?

Is that the correction you would like?

</quote>

Only if you consider women who have healthy sexual relationships to be "sluts".

What I find amusing is that the economic system that Republicans support (which is most of us slaving away at thankless jobs so a few rich douchebags like Romney and Limbaugh can have polo ponies and mansions) actually requires contraception.

Women are expected to use contraception in college, so they can get their degrees, and they are expected to use contraception while working their way up through Cubicle Hell. And maybe, if they are really lucky, they might be just secure enough in their jobs to take some time off to have a baby. Maybe. They often wait until the biological clock is about to run out.

Only retrograde, repressed right wingers think a woman who takes birth control is a slut.

But keep it up, darlinks. Carry that banner all the way to November - for the win!
