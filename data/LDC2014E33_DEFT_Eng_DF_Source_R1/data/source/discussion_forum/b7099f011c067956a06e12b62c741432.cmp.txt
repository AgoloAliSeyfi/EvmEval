LOL, nothing like ignoring the REAL polls...

so Obama is going to gain momentum? well, where did it go in the first place?

I guess he hasn't given enough t.v interviews or taken enough bus trips to campaign on our dime.

Where do you get this information from that Obama uses tax payer money to do interviews and bus trips? He has campaign money, you know. That's what it is used for.

Every time Obama goes anywhere it cost taxpayers money. If his campaign tried to cover all the costs they would run out of money in a week.

Think about this. It isn't hard. Obama has topped the list 4 years in a row. Each time they've used about 1000 people. Do you really think the same people have answered each year? No, they have not. They make sure to use random samples each time.

No, but it does seem difficult for you to compare 2008 with today.

In 2008, Obama won the poll with 32%

Today he won the poll with 17%

Based on the trend in random sampling, it doesn't look good for Obama winning an election in November 2012.

Next time don't bring a butter knife to a gunfight.

It does look good actually. He is even with Romney in most national polls and has a slight lead in some of them. From here, he is only going to gain momentum.

I though we were talking about the astonishing drop in Obama's popularity since he became president?

Now you're talking about someone named "Romney" who is EVEN with Obama?

Are you capable of staying on topic within your own threads?

No, you aren't.

And quite frankly, I cannot blame you for wanting to change the subject: Even I am feeling embarassed for you....

Come on, now you are arguing for the sake of arguing. You can feel anything you want. I'm not the one overreaching.

The porn movie reference is quite appropriate.
