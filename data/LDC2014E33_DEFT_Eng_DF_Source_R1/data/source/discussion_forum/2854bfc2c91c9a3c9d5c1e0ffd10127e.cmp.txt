Not just factory workers, either.

Eventually you'll be initially screened at the hospital by a computer program, too.

There is almost nothing that people can do that sooner or later a robot or computer program won't be able to do better and or cheaper.

And you know what that really means?

The end of capitalism as we know it.

Seriously, you cannot have capitalism when 80% or more of the population isn't employable because tecnology is doing the jobs they once did.

And no, this problem we're just now beginning to face is magnitudes larger in terms of disrupting our labor patterns than the industrial revolution ever was.

Because in that revolution, farming help went to work in factories. They STILL had jobs.

In the technolgical revolution, factory workers (and the mangament which once oversaw their work) and highly skilled workers (like Doctors, lawyers, and other professional INCLUDING SOFTWARE ENGINEERS) are going to find that they cannot compete with technology, and AI pprograms either.

Then how does our economic system work?

Do we continue to only reward those elements of our society who OWN the technology?

And who will be the consumers buying all this techologically made wealth when nobody has a job to make the money to buy it all, anyway?

Remember now, this problem is aleady starting to include highly educated people whose jobs are better done by machines and programs.

Should we let the majority of the society starve?

Our technology is going to change our economic system, folks.

Count on that.

And the transition from industrial capitalism to technology capitalism isn't going to be easy on the MAJORITY of us regardless of how well we educate ourselves.

yes you are close, but not all poisitons in science and engineering will be overtaken. AI is not to where a robot learn say a physics undergrad worth of knowledge without it being programmed into him (which isn't learning obviously). unless there is a major breakthrough in AI or robots can be programmed to learn on their own, the high end science &amp; engineering jobs will still be human done. the resst of the population as you say, probably greather than 80% will be replaced by machines with no jobs available whetehr its because tehy are too old to learn the science needed or just refused to learn science along the way.

(sorry..cannot get the quote function to work)

As we can now plainly see thanls to Youtube and the rest of the internet, creativity in humans isn't all that rare.

We can see people who are amazinginly talented who will never make any money for their talents.

So even assuming we are all Michelanglo's, our creativity doesn't amount to a hill of beans as far as making a living.

We're either going to change the way we reward people, or we're going to end up with a huge percentage of the population who cannot find work that they can do, that anybody will pay them to do.

Those of you who are sitting back thinking your skills are so special that they cannot be done by AI programs and or robots are in for a BIG SHOCK.

That is EXACTLY what skilled industrial machninists used to tell me, too. That their jobs reqired so much training and experience that they could never be replaced, either.

They are mostly now unemployed, (well many of them are retired, but nobody replaced them at the lathes, either) working at McJobs and trying to cope with their losses in incomes.

yes it is a hard thing to swallow for most poeple, that is that they can be replaced with something that barely has a brain as we use ours. it basically boils down to if your job requires critical though or not. if it doesn't you will be replaced. I do comptuer security &amp; forensics research so I think I will be safe for a long time or possibly ever unless the major AI breakthrough I talked about in my last post happens.

Can a human produce an AI that is more intelligent, in every measure, than himself?

If he cannot, his job is secure.

If he can, we ought to be welcoming our robot overlords.

see my posts... it will only be high end/high education science and engineering jobs left.

I'm sorry, I can't tell if you're joking or not.

Robots only become feasible if they are doing something that makes many thousands or millions. Like cars.

If it's only a few hundred, then the time it takes to program the robot and verify it's doing the task correctly, you could have the job already finished. So robots are limited.

not joking. I have seen a bunch of places that say it costs 1mil per year to send a troop to iraq. don't you think a mass produced robot would be cost much less than that, be easier to replace, etc?

</quote>

Yeah and it coud distinguish between enemy and friend?
It could als be reprogrammed to kill us.
Kinda like teabaggers.

</quote>

distinguish - yes
robots to kill us - they already have those
lame comment about teabaggers
