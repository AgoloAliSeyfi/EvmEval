That’s how it is now; Network Rail owns the infrastructure and the various train operators pay them for its use. These private companies obviously aren’t running services as effectively as they should though or this thread would never have been started. I might have misunderstood before as I thought you were arguing for competition between infrastructure providers as well as service operators- I’m glad we agree that competition can’t exist in that area, at least.

However you’re still arguing that meaningful competition can exist between the service operators using that infrastructure. Due to the limitations touched on in my last post though, the problem is that railways are relatively unique in that there’s no obvious way there can be greater (fairer) competition, nor, more importantly, any indication as how more competition (effectively, fragmentation of the system) would actually lead to improvements in service. I mentioned before why a system run by a single organisation has an advantage over one outsourced to many, but I don't want to go over old ground again.

Well I think we just have a fundamental disagreement here. If I didn't think competition could happen on trains, then yes, reluctantly, I would be in favour of nationalisation. Bet you didn't expect that <img src="images/smilies/wink.png"/>

The other issue is that, when looking at the system as a whole, profitable areas of the business should be used to prop up the unprofitable. That’s only really achievable by having one entity in control of all aspects of the system, from signals to rolling stock, because the alternative is something akin to the current model where profitable parts of the system are taken over and run solely to funnel money into private hands, whilst public money is used to subsidise and invest in those parts of the system which the private sector don’t want. This is why I contend that a single organisation should be in charge of the system as a whole. It should be state-run (or at least state-owned) because of the obvious drawbacks to private sector monopolies- at least the government of the day is somewhat accountable.

I address this later in the post, I think the point covers both.

I’d have no problem with nationalising the water supply. Private ownership has led to massive under-investment in infrastructure which wastes millions of gallons of water every day, whilst utility bills rise and rise.

But where would the public money come from to provide the investment! You already want the trains nationalised, now water and presumably royal mail. All of these things AT BEST would break even operationally. Look at German and Spanish banks, the weakest and least profitable are? You've guessed it, the state run firms. Publicly run businesses are typically inefficient in terms of budget, surely you can agree with me on that.

<quote orig_author="creak">
I’m glad you brought Royal Mail up, too. It’s a perfect example of what I was talking about a couple of paragraphs up. RM worked when it had a monopoly over the postal service in which the profitable areas of the business were used to fund the less profitable areas; it operated a genuinely universal service, it was cheap and simple for the user, and it made money. It’s been gutted in recent years however by exactly the sort of cherry-picking you’ve advocated above. The more profitable parts of the company such as parcel delivery and inter- and intra-city mail were split from the rest of the network and sold to private companies (UKMail etc.). The subsequent loss of revenue from the profitable areas of the business led to under-investment, removal/reduction of services and financial difficulties for the remaining parts, such as the rural/long distance mail and the broader distribution network. Now reduced profits from what's left of the organisation have resulted in stronger calls from within government to privatise the rest of it, because apparently in it’s current form it's ‘not working’- ignoring the fact that it was government measures undermining the company that caused it to fail in the first place!

I don't understand the cherry picking argument. You could nationalise BP or Vodafone, say, and harvest the profits to fund the trains for example. Why does it have to be within the same industry? It seems like you have a problem with companies making a profit.

<quote orig_author="creak">
I (admittedly rather lazily) use monopoly simply to mean an industry/sector with a single entity controlling all or most of the business within it. The French and German railways are both run by state-owned companies operating as virtual monopolies. I don’t know how much they cost to run, but they’re widely regarded as some of the most efficient and best value services on the continent.

But you're still asking the car, bus, plane and coach user to subsidise the train user. Remember, the argument in favour of nationalisation was lower fares, more trains and greater investment. Each one of these will cost a great deal of public money.

To anyone who is for re-nationalisation:

EVER USED TRANSLINK? NO? **** UP. THATS GOVERNMENT RAN PRACTICALLY while posing as a private company. Monopoly. No one else is allowed on board the NI transport services.

Now **** up.
