I emailed Kevin Barrett about some errors he made in a presentation. As evidence that the government is able to keep big secrets, he claims the NSA was founded in 1948 and remained secret until 1990, when in fact it was founded in 1952 and I couldn't find any evidence that it was ever a secret institution, but it was in TV shows like Star Trek since the 1960s, so certainly by then it was publicly known. This isn't really a big deal when it comes to 9/11, but when "truthers" blatantly lye to audiences like this just gets to me. Anyway, he responded (my original email is also mixed in) with:

Edited by chillzero: Email removed for copyright violation. Emailed included invitation to radio show, and claimed the NSA was founded in 1948 and didn't become publicly known until 1990.

Why does fiction not suffice? If the NSA is on TV shows, it's not a secret. Anyway, does Kevin Barrett have some kind of radio show? I'd love to tear apart his lies, but I don't know how good I'd be on a radio show. I'd rather leave that to folks who aren't intimidated by public speaking, like Mark Roberts. Any chance you'd like to go on the radio with Kevin Barrett, Mark? I know he's saving your emails for your eventual trial (lol), but I can email him back if you're interested.

The NSA was public knowledge in the 1950s. It was, for example, the subject of front-page scandals due to defecting employees/security breaches.

(I also vaguely remember there being an issue with a highway exit sign that said, "NSA" or "National Security Agency." IIRC, the sign was erected early on, but was removed as being too obvious. I could be imagining that, however. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/smile.gif"/> )

Yes, Barrett has radio shows on a couple of crackpot networks. You can see the schedule and get the flavor at his website, mujca.com.

Thanks for thinking of me, but I don't have the desire to appear on his show. He invited me in the past (while simultaneously saying I should be tried and executed), and I told him that I believe he is mentally ill and needs help, not attention.

Barrett is very much on the fringe. I think most people (William Rodriguez excepted), truther and rationalist alike, are wise enough to recognize that he has a serious problem and shouldn't be encouraged.

Now everyone knows that NSA stands for No Such Agency.

Barrett has 3 radio shows, he has a lot of free time now that he is no longer a part-time college professor. They are all fringe Internet radio though, he has a daytime program he shares with Jim Fetzer (called hilariously the Dynamic Duo) on GCN, and a weekly show on RBN and WTPRN respectively.

It was so secret that James Bamford was able to write a book about in 1982, The Puzzle Palace. After years of denial, the NSA recognized him for it and what he said has help up pretty well now that some the NSA's activities have been acknowledged.

I took Barrett's class on Islam at UW-Madison. Pure coincidence. I signed up for the class and then months later found out there was a whole bunch of controversy over it.

It's pretty sad. He seemed ok when talking about Islam...but then when I found out about his attitude of "no muslim would ever kill people! therefore, it was christians that did it!" really made me question everything he had ever said. How could somebody teach a class about religion at a respected university when he believes something so utterly absurd? His teaching assistants had greater perspective then he did.
