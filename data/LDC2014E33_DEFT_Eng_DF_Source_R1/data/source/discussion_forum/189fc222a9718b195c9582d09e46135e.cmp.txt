But of course I expected everyone to jump up and try to claim that I was comparing Glenn Beck to the Hitler everyone knows as the dictator who marched across Europe and planned the Final Solution, while I was merely pointing out that if people don't have facts and will ONLY listen to propaganda, they WILL BE drawn to a charismatic personality. In all honesty, there was much about Obama's charisma that people ONLY voted for, which is equally as wrong, in my opinion. People need to dig deeper than they do and stop automatically believing all the sweet talk, the hate talk, the bullshit and spin and educate themselves.

Wow... how'd you slip out of quantum phase and end up in our reality? Could you keep on slipping and go somewhere else please? That's moonbat territory.

In all seriousness Maggie...

What are you moaning about?
You are disparaging speeches you haven't heard...saying you agree with others thoughts, but not if you don't like them...

That's not saying much about the foundation of your opinions.

It's disturbing that someone like Glenn Beck can so brainwash so many people. I fear for the intelligence level that is being mass produced today that people seem unable to do their own fact-checking and get at the truth themselves. Glenn Beck is a liar and an antagonist, a keeper of the political flame that keeps this country DIVIDED, not united. It's that simple. Why should I believe he's suddenly had an epiphany and is now trying to gather all the flock for a big kumbaya moment when he has heretofore done nothing but alienate?

Yes..yes...so how specifically is he dividing this country?
Again specifically...with examples.

Do your own homework (not that it will matter).

Lots of non-white speakers at this event. Why would so many minorities show up and speak at an event like this if it was a discrace to MLK or if a bunch of "racist white people" were going to the rally?

It looks like reality and the anti-rally talking points are in conflict.

bodecca called her a "token" the other day. It was a jab at the asshole bodecca.

I hate that The Imposter sullies my name.

She was Bodecca before you stole her username. Anyone here from hannity.com can testify to that.

It's easy to tell you apart: she's Bodecea, and you are Bodickhead.

its disturbing to me that you can't cite a fucking source.

You want ONE source? No wonder you don't get it.

Glen Beck is no George Wasington.

</quote>

ok. so can you answer the question please?

</quote>

No, I would not call George Washington a fascist.

Now answer my question. If honor needs to be restored, if must have been taken. How can honor be taken, and, if it was taken, who took it?

</quote>

Honor does not have to be taken, honor can however disappear as faith fades from the people. Today's rally was to help inspire americans to be kind and charitable, tolerant and loving. Values that stem from judeo-christian heritage the heritage of the founding fathers. the source of their wisdom and their sacred honor, and the source of the motivation to make the USA the most free and secure nation under GOD.

Get it?

Honor does not have to be taken. It has been left abandoned. Knocked out of the hands of children by those who threw it away back in the 1960's.
