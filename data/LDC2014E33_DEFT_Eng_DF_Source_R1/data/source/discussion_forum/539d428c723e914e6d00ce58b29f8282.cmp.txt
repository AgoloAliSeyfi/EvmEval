we are going down like a rock....

and obama ain't a smidgen of the reasons why....

i heard this morning on c-span the State governments in the us have a $234 TRILLION dollar obligation to government employee retirements.

And the federal government has similar obligations for the retirement pensions and health care fof their exemployees, and the military with their exemployees....

i don't know if this health care proposal of the Dems will reduce the speed of the health care prices or save some money in the long run....or cost us more, but even without one thing done with this health care bill....

we, as a country, are in deep deep crapola.

That's what happens when you try to live off the backs of the successful hardworking people and live beyond your means

I don't understand?

Are those of us who have not worked for the government "the backs of the successful hard working people", and the ones trying to live off of us 'retired government workers'?

We can not afford socialized medicine. We already can not afford medicare. Yet by adding MILLIONS more suddenly all will be fine?

The primary reasons why Medicare runs in the red is the majority of those covered by medicare subsidized by payroll taxes aren't paying premiums. Only $2.9 billion of its income of nearly $231 billion comes from its client base --- which are statistically the sickest demographic (seniors and disabled) and with a larger healthier client base, that means more money in revenue vs expenditures.

Cover everyone with Medicare, and the size and overall health of their client base goes up along with the revenue income from premiums.

EVERYONE that works pays into medicare. EVERYONE. There is no other way to put it. Medicare is already subsidized by OUR TAXES from every person in this country that works. And it fails miserably.

I'm not sure that is true. those who make their income, their living, through investments do NOT PAY MEDICARE taxes.

And it does not fail miserably, if we had NO medicare at all, then look at it...you will KNOW what failure is.
