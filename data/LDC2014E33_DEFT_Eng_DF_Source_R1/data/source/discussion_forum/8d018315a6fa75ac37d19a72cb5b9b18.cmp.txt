Here's the text of the so-called "apology" issued Saturday by the Fat Man. If this was any weaker, it would look like swiss cheese with all the holes in it. Of course, it'll appease his dittoloonies.
"For over 20 years, I have illustrated the absurd with absurdity, three hours a day, five days a week. In this instance, I chose the wrong words in my analogy of the situation. I did not mean a personal attack on Ms. Fluke.

"I think it is absolutely absurd that during these very serious political times, we are discussing personal sexual recreational activities before members of Congress. I personally do not agree that American citizens should pay for these social activities. What happened to personal responsibility and accountability? Where do we draw the line? If this is accepted as the norm, what will follow? Will we be debating if taxpayers should pay for new sneakers for all students that are interested in running to keep fit? In my monologue, I posited that it is not our business whatsoever to know what is going on in anyone's bedroom nor do I think it is a topic that should reach a Presidential level.

"My choice of words was not the best, and in the attempt to be humorous, I created a national stir. I sincerely apologize to Ms. Fluke for the insulting word choices."

Does Rush realize that millions of married couples use birth control? It's about responsible parenthood not wanton sex

President Obama later apologized for the Limbaugh apology.

The White House promptly issued a clarification of (coupled with another apology for) the President's apology.

I wonder if Limbaugh's apology will cause rioting and U.S. soldiers to be murdered. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eek.gif"/>

What really pisses me off is that the leftist SCUM in this country say ABOMINABLE things about non-leftist people, every minute of every day, and NOBODY is asking any of the leftists to APOLOGIZE.............unless of course you are a leftist who is apologizing to terrorists for the behavior of "disrespectful" Americans.

The leftists and the haters and the bedwetting progressives in this country can PACK SAND. How about you FREAKS apologize for the horrible things you have said about people like Sarah Palin, Michelle Bachman, Michelle Malkin, and other conservative females? Until that time, or when hell freezes over, whichever comes first, STFU!

Worth highlighting what the Carbonite CEO said:

<quote>
No one with daughters the age of Sandra Fluke, and I have two, could possibly abide the insult and abuse heaped upon this courageous and well-intentioned young lady. Mr. Limbaugh, with his highly personal attacks on Miss Fluke, overstepped any reasonable bounds of decency. Even though Mr. Limbaugh has now issued an apology, we have nonetheless decided to withdraw our advertising from his show. We hope that our action, along with the other advertisers who have already withdrawn their ads, will ultimately contribute to a more civilized public discourse.

"I'm going broke having sex! I need... I need the government to provide me condoms and contraception. It's not fair." Okay, so this is a law student at a congressional committee asking for us... to... pay... for... the... things... that... make... it... possible... for... her... to... have... sex.

Therefore we are paying her to have sex.

Therefore we are paying her for having sex.

We are getting screwed even though we don't meet her personally!

What would you call this? * * * *

THAT is what Rush said. Well, he said more, too, of course. But that (in his won words) is what he was saying. <a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2012/03/01/left_freaks_out_over_my_fluke_remarks">Left Freaks Out Over My Fluke Remarks - The Rush Limbaugh Show</a>

It continues with another reference to what he had said that led to the uproar,

<quote>
"'What does it say about the college co-ed [Sandra] Fluke, who goes before a congressional committee and essentially says that she must be paid to have sex -- what does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a prostitute.'

</quote>

-- id.

As he noted, he used absurdity to expose absurdity. And now he has apologized for going about it in the wrong way.

Naturally, the left (having an agenda to deal with) cannot possibly credit him for acknowledging that maybe he did go about it in the wrong way.
