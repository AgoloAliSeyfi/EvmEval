Of course there were prohibitions against theft and murder before Moses, that was expressed in my post (Moral Imperative).

Can you clarify your remark, specifically, "theft is illegal not because it's necessarily immoral" with an example of when theft is moral or amoral?

moral theft... stealing the car keys off a drunk driver.

That would certainly be a good example. But more to the point that there are laws which certainly coincide with a "moral code" such as laws against murder or theft but the real sticking point is that those acts violate the rights of others. People often make the argument that our laws are based on the ten commandments or are based on Judeo-Christian theology and that's not quite the case. Only two (arguably three or four) of the commandments are enforced by law in the United States and those that are existed in most societies long before Judaism even entered the picture. Other laws based on a moral belief (such as the Massachusetts "crimes against chastity laws") have been declared to be unconstitutional. So what I am getting at is that government only enforces "morality" when it happens to coincidentally do so in the act of protecting the personal rights of other people.

I am sure there are exceptions that can be found and certainly there are still "moral laws" on the books, but for the most part they are rarely enforced or they get shot down when brought before the SCOTUS unless they have some secondary purpose that overrides the moral purpose.

Most crimes in the Penal Code - and other codes - have victims, and are therefore protecting the rights of others. There are exceptions however, being under the influence of a drug or narcotic is one, a women exposing her breast in public is another. Aren't these examples of the government enforcing a moral code?

Socialists/Progressives like to have it both ways on issues like this. They don't really want the Government out of the bedroom. They only want that when it's convenient for them. They fully support the Government forcing Taxpayers to subsidize fellow Citizens' personal sexual behavior. They also fully support forcing Taxpayers to subsidize Abortions. So they're not very honest or consistent. It's time for Big Government to really get out of the bedroom. Let the age of personal responsibility dawn.

No, they dont, because they know its illegal to use taxpayers funds to subsidize abortion. So liberals dont want to have it both ways, theyre being perfectly honest and consistent.

If conservatives really want Big Government out of the bedroom and an age of personal responsibility to dawn, then they need to cease their efforts to violate a womans right to privacy with regard to abortion and access to contraceptives.

The hypocrisy and ignorance belongs to conservatives alone.

Unless of course one is dealing with conservatives who oppose abortion for women in cases of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother; in addition to being ignorant hypocrites, such conservatives are also criminals.

Juxtaposing abortions and bedrooms is a little strange, don't you think? Especially on top of the false claim that women are being denied access to contraceptives.

Sex is optional. You can either choose to have sex or knot. If you choose to have sex you should act like a good girl and not a whore. A whore expects others to pay for her to play..

So any woman whose insurance company currently covers birth control is a whore

Thanks for clarifying

Clarifying? That one didn't make sense...even for you... Seriously, if we oppose government forcing insurance companies to pay for contraceptives then we're against insurance companies paying for contraceptives? The concept of free choice for both companies and consumers isn't even on your radar?

Insurance covers thousands of medications and procedures. Are they being "forced" on you too?
