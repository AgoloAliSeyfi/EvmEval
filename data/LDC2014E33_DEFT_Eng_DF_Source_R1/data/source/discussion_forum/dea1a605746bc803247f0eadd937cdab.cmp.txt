How come the US was fine when it intervened in Latin American affairs, and still does? How come Costa Ricans aren't blowing up buildings? How come people from Singapore aren't taking US hostages? Your argument falls flat on its face when you look at American intervention elsewhere and realize that they intervened much more abroad than in the Middle East.

You list a few attacks that have resulted in the death of thousands? Well i could write a book on the millions of deaths caused by western (namely American) foreign policy in the Middle East. A place which by the constitution they had no right to be.

Go for it.

Our leaders and our media (and you) say fundamentalists attack us because we are free, or because we have loose morals. But that is merely propaganda. The terrorists have told us why they attack. Osama Bin Laden has repeated these reasons many times in his videos. The main ones being the unlawful basing of American troops in Saudi Arabia, on what is considered sacred Holy land by the people who live there (eg, Osama). Another reason he has mentioned was is the continued support and funding by the Americans of the hated Saudi royal family. Have you never wondered why so many fundamentalists come from Saudi Arabia? (Of those who attacked the WTC over two thirds were from Saudi)

They fund the Saudis because the alternative is much worse. The Shah of Iran is far better than the 1979 revolutionaries- the current islamofascit dictators.

Isreal is another big problem. The Islamic people in the middle east, when they see news from Palestine and the gaza strip, they see American helicopters killing the innocent civilians, they see American vehicles crushing houses and waging war on an Islamic state. It just so happens that these vehicles are being piloted by Isrealis. Now before you accuse me of being anti-Isreal, i am not. What i am against is the last 40 years of American maniulation of the Isreali/palestine conflict, because not only have the Americans been funding and supporting Isreal, all through the 80's and 90's they were funding the PLO, they kept the conflict alive for over two decades. Why! why did they fund both sides?

They didnt give the PLO $ for terrorism, they donated funds with every other country to try and build infrastructure.

I could go on and on and on, there are countless examples; Afganhistan, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait... All in the name of the PetroDollar, and American dominance of the Global oil market. That is what has driven American foreign policy in the Middle East for the last half century, greed and power. Instead of peace commerce and friendship as it says in the constittion. America has bought war, embargoes, and hate, and we the people have just sat around shirking our responsiblities and letting them do it.

It's not about oil, if America wanted oil they could take it by force or ruin a countries economy.

You wonder why there were bombings on American embassy buildings all over the Isalmic world. Well ask yourself this, why were the majority of embassies bombed American, why not French? or British? Because the Americans are more free?... Dont make me laugh. Put simply every action creates a reaction. Those extremists did not blow themselves up to just attack America. They blew themselves up to take revenge on America. All those innocents who died on 9/11. Where as much victims of American foreign policy as those innocents who died in Iraq, Afghanistan, palestine and Isreal

Clearly you haven't been reading the news. France, Britain and Spain have been hit by terror attacks, Canada has thwarted a few attacks and every western nation is under threat from terrorism.
