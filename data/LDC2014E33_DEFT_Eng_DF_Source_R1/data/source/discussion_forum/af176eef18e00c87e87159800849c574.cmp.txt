Reading all of your posts with interest.

No, I've never enjoyed running. I'm more of a rowing, elliptical, walking on the trails person.

One thing ragman I'd like to mention to you, which may make a difference in how I feel in the shoes....

In reading all the info I could, and also reading reviews of buyers, both the people who loved them and one who actually said it caused her to fall over because she couldn't balance on them (and broke an ankle or something) I have given the following conditions and knowledge I have consideration.....Hope you aren't bored.....

As I mentioned above, I'm going into my 9th out of 10 rolfing sessions this Friday. I'm at the point where every muscle in my body has been worked on, and these last couple of sessions will work on more fully intergrating everything together (although each session is incorporated into the body, and what has already been done). In fact, I may take a break for a few weeks, but I've discussed with my rolfer and we both agree I would benefit from another session or two working specifcally on my chest/neck area, as my chest is my far the most tightly bound up part of me, and my neck has always been a suseptible area for problems...

What does all this have to do with the shoes?

Well, without boring you further, my body right now is in the best state it's been in, in I don't know how long, maybe ever. The purpose of rolfing is to open up the muscle from the fascia, and if I told you all the changes it's made in my posture, flexibility and in my core, you might think I'm embellishing. But I'm not. My ankles, knees, hips, torso, shoulders, neck and head are all in this straight, strong, balanced line. My center of gravity going down my legs are support equally by my entire foot, not leaning back, or forward, or to the sides. In fact, leaning on on foot, like you see people do, is not very comfortable.

Anyway, pilates exercise, as we all know, work on the core too. However, I could never do those exercises properly, because my body wasn't aligned, and I couldn't make the movements in a proper way...In one review, it was said that the wearing the Chung Shi's was like "a pilates class in a shoe" because of the way the shoe is built, it makes you stand with your weight in the proper area...anyway, looking at it from that view, I would think that someone who is all out of whack would find it very uncomfortable, because you'd be standing in a way that is making your bound up muscle, being held in the improper position by your fascia, try to go into the proper place, but it would be unable to.

I'm thinking, (and mind you, I'm only thinking) that if your muscles are opened up and where they should be, these shoes would just allow you to stand in the way you want to when you're barefoot anyway. (No, I don't wear heels)

One of the things these shoes were recommended for was for people who have, I can't remember or say the medical term, but basically screwed up fascia in their feet.

One thing I have learned is that your feet are the base for every other muscle in your body. If they aren't standing properly, you may feel it in the stranges place, and not even realize it's related to your foot. My feet are opened up, and the shoe is made to open up your foot, so....to me it makes sense.

I'm not going to rush right out tonight and buy them, and I am going to go back and reread both of your posts more carefully.

However, when I see Sandy my rolfer this Friday, I'm going to take any info I've gathered and show her, to get her opinion, and to find out if she's heard anything. She's been doing this for something like 20 years, and is an RN also, and knows every muscle, tendon, bone and ligament in my body intimately by this time, and over time, and because of what she's done for me, I put a lot of store in her opinion. If I bought them, I would take them to her, and have her evaluate them with me wearing them, to see if I'm standing, walking properly in them.

There's a New Balance shoe store at Santana Row in San Jose where my wife and her friends purchased shoes. They have a consultant that helps you fit your shoes, and tells you about the different pros and cons of the different shoe styles, and what they're for. I also buy New Balance and Rockports because they are comfortable, and I can walk in them all day without any pain or discomfort.

I love walking, and sometimes will walk over ten miles in one day.

Yeah c.i.

I must have inherited a "walking" gene from my grandmother.

When she was in her 70's, I'd be driving a few miles from the house and come upon her taking a stroll.

I'd say, "Granma, get in, I'll drive you the rest of the way home"

She always just wave her hands at me, like...shoo! shoo!
