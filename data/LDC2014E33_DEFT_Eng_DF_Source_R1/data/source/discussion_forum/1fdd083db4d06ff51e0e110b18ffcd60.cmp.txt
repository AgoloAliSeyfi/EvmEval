Your points are good......though I would suggest much went on that we do not know of in terms of NATO sponsored murder of innocent European civilians and the framing of law abiding communists.

I am very disturbed by what goes on in "non white countries". Here in San Francisco we are quite non white as a group. That said, your point is OUTSTANDING about the selectiveness of outrage. Great post!!!!!

That selective outrage is simply a psychological mechanism.

As they used to say in journalism school: to determine the importance of a story, divide the distance through the number of casualties.

We feel stronger about people who are geographically closer. Or more accurately, more like us.

Of course one man's conspiracy is another man's reasonable political and economic maneuver, but the cigarette thing is pretty ridiculous. Dontcha' think so Greg?.......

The stats are beyond grim;

1) Around 5.4 million deaths a year are caused by tobacco.

2) Smoking is set to kill 6.5 million people in 2015 and 8.3 million humans in 2030, with the biggest rise in low-and middle-income countries.

3) Every 6.5 seconds a current or former smoker dies, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

4) An estimated 1.3 billion people are smokers worldwide (WHO).

5) Over 443,000 Americans (over 18 percent of all deaths) die because of smoking each year. Secondhand smoke kills about 50,000 of them.

6) 1.2 million people in China die because of smoking each year. That's 2,000 people a day.

7) Tobacco use will kill 1 billion people in the 21st century if current smoking trends continue.

8) 33 percent to 50 percent of all smokers are killed by their habit.

9) Smokers die on average 15 years sooner than nonsmokers.

Sometimes the conspirators don't congregate and plot in smoked filled rooms, rather, they simply pretend nothing is going on. Some are so stupid like the members of the US Congress/US Senate. They did/do not even realize their actions, in this case subsidizing the tobacco industry, resulted in so many American deaths.

And those poor poor poor farmers, needing all that subsidizing, and then the buyout to boot(buyout occurred in 2004), growing cyanide as it were, and here we didn't know cigarettes were deadly until the 1950s. That's not much warning now is it?

Now how many Americans was it that died in the Civil War? 625,000.... somptin' like that. WWI 117,000, WWII 400,000, Korea 36,000 Vietnam 58,000......Total American deaths due to war since 1775 2,500,000.

So let's see there, 400,000 cigarette related deaths in the US a year, so every six years roughly stoggies kill as many Americans as all US wars combined did. Every three years stoggies killed as many Americans as did the Civil War, WWI, WWII, the Korean War, the war in Vietnam. Pretty dang good population control on the part of the US senate wouldn't ya' say?

Yeah, it did start to get pretty dang obvious, the "murder pays" MO as it related to cigarettes, so eventually taking the show on the road did make eminent sense......

Maybe we outta' seal up the windows and doors of the Capitol building during a joint sessions and pump it full of tobacco smoke and not open the front door 'til Nancy Peolsi has coughed her face into an expression that at least approximates that of a real person.....

What is your point here? That the government should ban tobacco? Where exactly is the conspiracy?

Thank you. This was not the answer I was expecting. I appreciate very much that you understand my concern.

It took me a second reading to understand this, but when I did, I realized this is the problem that drives me crazy with conspiracy theory. It's not about people. It's just a perverted version of their image of the USA.
