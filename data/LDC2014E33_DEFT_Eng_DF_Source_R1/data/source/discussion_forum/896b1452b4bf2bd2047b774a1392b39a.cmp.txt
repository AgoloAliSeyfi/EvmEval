Local OWS activists were part of this protest.

File this under "Holy S***!"

Hundreds of protesters from various groups converged on the state capitol in Topeka, Kansas today. Shortly before the protesters arrived, Capitol Police discovered a truck laden with explosives parked outside the capitol.

KAKE News reports:

Police say theyve arrested the owner of a suspicious pickup truck that was found parked near the Kansas Statehouse with several homemade explosives inside and that had specialty license plates issued only to U.S. military paratroopers.

"Capitol Police Spokesman Patrick Saleh says officers arrested the pickups owner Wednesday in an underground tunnel that connects the Statehouse to a nearby state office building.

....

"Saleh said the Topeka Police Departments bomb squad was called to investigate the pickup after an officer saw suspicious objects inside. He says they found explosives made with household materials and designed to spray shrapnel upon detonation.

2. Good thing that cop was smart enough to notice the suspicious objects in the truck.

That could have been a real tragedy. There is immense hatred for this movement. I hope they all remain safe.

13. It was an immigrants rights protest, not OWS

Sounds like the guy with the bombs was a minuteman. He had a bumper sticker on his truck that said 'Welcome to America. Speak English.'

16. Okay, thanks for that correction. I got it from an OWS activist who was there

representing that group.

That info makes it even more likely that the target of the bomb threat was the protesters, in my mind.

17. I didn't know there were any OWS groups in Topeka

There was a small group in KC but they have disbanded.

This rally had been planned for quite awhile by the immigrants rights groups. Perhaps there were some OWS folks there but it was not their event.

3. Yeah, this sounds like bullshit.

One, the protesters were not targeted. That's an invention of the blog reprinting this. Second, I have a really hard time believing that there were any ACTUAL "explosives," since the news story they link to talks about one guy getting arrested for THREATENING Governor Brownback. Nothing about explosives charges, etcetera, which they'd be quick on top of if there were any actual explosives. Given the way these stories get exaggerated, "several improvised explosive devices" could mean anything down to a few bundles of firecrackers--or nothing at all, since false reports aren't at all uncommon. Doubly so since they apparently did not even bother to tow the truck, so clearly there wasn't a serious threat.

Translation out of hype-speak: some kook made threatening noises at Brownback and got arrested. The end.

4. A report from a media source

<a href="http://www.times-standard.com/ci_19971941">http://www.times-standard.com/ci_19971941</a>

TOPEKA, Kan.Several homemade bombs were found Wednesday in a pickup truck parked near the Kansas Statehouse that had specialty license plates issued only to U.S. military paratroopers, and police said they arrested the owner inside an underground tunnel connecting the Capitol to an office building.

Capitol Police spokesman Patrick Saleh said the incident was not connected to another arrest Wednesday of a man who allegedly phoned in a threat to Gov. Sam Brownback's office from a Topeka motel.
...

The discovery of the pickup truck led authorities to temporarily block traffic and access to the parking lot. The black Ford with no hood and a beat-up front grill, remained in the Judicial Center parking lot Wednesday afternoon, set off by a police car and orange cones.

...

But Saleh said neither arrest was connected to a coinciding rally at the Statehouse that was protesting policies pursued by Brownback, Kobach and other Republican officials.

26. I'm still going to wait a few days before I believe one word of this.

These stories have an amazing ability to morph into absolutely nothing, especially if they're ever forced to comment on what the "homemade bombs" were. I remember far too many stories where the news reported "improvised explosives" only to find out later that it was total bullshit. Even so, the original source is simply false in associating it with Occupy Wall Street or the protesters.

29. I can tell you one thing--it's not a "federal case," at least not yet.

TOPEKA, Kan.  A man detained after homemade bombs were found inside his pickup near the Kansas Statehouse will not face federal charges, a federal law enforcement spokeswoman said Thursday.

Spokeswoman Trista Frederick of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said the agency helped with the investigation but that the case is being handled by Topeka authorities. She did not elaborate on why the matter wouldnt become a federal case.

32. No federal case generally means no explosives.

BATFE is zealous to the point of rabid in involving themselves with anything they can. If they're not, then it's because there's nothing that fall under their jurisdiction.

19. I live in Kansas and I'm not the least bit surprised.

We have quite an active and violent group of minutemen here in Kansas. And they come to most of the immigrants rights rallies and try to intimidate the attendees. A bomb wouldn't be unbelievable at all for these people.
