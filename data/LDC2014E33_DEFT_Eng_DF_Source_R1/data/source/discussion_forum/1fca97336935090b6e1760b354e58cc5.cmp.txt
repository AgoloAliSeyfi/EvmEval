Yet the majority of the MSM totally underplayed the racial angle, for reasons everyone by now understands: the killer was black, and the victims were white. My own local newspaper made absolutely no mention of the racial element in the small brief it ran. But given that race was what (rightly or wrongly) drove the entire incident, the medias censorship of this is a gross dereliction of duty.

His own words indicted him as a racist.

He was a thief and got caught so he decided to exact retribution against all of those racists he didn't like.

That's pretty close to the truth although I think he suffered from other problems and scapegoated others for those problems. This is common among people who suffer deep depression or other illnesses. Now, if he was drinking on the job he just exacerbated the situation 10 fold because alchohol is simply a sedative that slowly puts your brain to sleep starting with the logical side so your left running on pure emotion. Very bad and has nothing to do with him being black.

i think anyone who goes in to work and kills 8 people is probably suffering from some sort of illness.

Regardless of why he did it, I still don't see how thinking other people treated one in a racist manner makes one a racist.

And funny that WJ would accuse someone of being what he so proudly is.... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Being black isn't a genetic defect.....but mentally this guy was all screwed up because of his obsession with race.

This guy was messed up....only a social degenerate feels that murder is a solution to depression.

If he had been white and ALL his victims black..... ya the press would not have mentioned that at all.

Maybe if the company hired more blacks or asians all the victims wouldn't have been white.

Or maybe he wouldn't have felt justified in killing anyone.

Then again maybe he was just a low-life that couldn't get along with anyone of the wrong color.

Maybe he feels everyone hates him because he's black

I think race was simply an easy answer for him. I don't think he was necessarily racist to begin with. It's possible, but we don't have enough to data to say either wasy so we can only speculate.

You'd be surprised what extremely sad people are capable of when they start to pin their problems on the wrong people. They turn hate into violence.
