This morning I was watching "Good Day New York" on Channel 5, which is part of the FOX network. The co-host were interviewing a guy who is part of the on-going occupation of Wall St., and were (of course) repeating the media standard line by questioning the man as to why there is no set goals or leadership to advocate such goals. During his response, the man pointed out that it's about all types of people pointing out that nothing is being done about the economic inequality and subsequent crimes perpetrated by Wall St./banking giants (individuals and corporations)....and that you had leaders from various backgrounds join in. He stated that Al Sharpton "a self made man from the streets like me" was joining.....at which time co-host Greg Kelly interjected (twice) that like Al Sharpton, Rupert Murdoch is a self made man.

<img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/confused.gif"/> Come again?

Rupert Murdoch INHERITED HIS FATHER'S OWNERSHIP OF TWO NEWSPAPERS IN THE U.K. (Australia). He did NOT start out in the copy room of some local city paper and work his way up to mogul.

Al Sharpton grew up doing the preacher circuit for his particular brand of religion. Big difference.

I saw this as just another Fox flunkie pushing the "class warfare" line that's heard from the neocon/teabagger pundits in the media. By trying to equate Murdoch as a successful "every man", co-host Greg Kelly pushes the subliminal context that the Wall St. protesters are just "jealous" of "successful people".

Typical Fox BS....but not unexpected.

Unfortunately Class Envy/Class Warfare works. The Democrats are turning American against American. It's an awful 'Divide &amp; Conquer' strategy. Look for them to ratchet this stuff up much more as the Election draws nearer. Anything to hold on to power i guess. It's very sad.

Laughable to say the least.

The right brays on and on about Unions, Public employee benefits, the Poor not paying income tax, people on welfare and food stamps and people on SSI.

Then..when anything is mentioned about the outrageous behavior of the the top tier in this country..it's class warfare.

Amazing.

Don't hate your fellow Americans. Being a success is a good thing. Don't be jealous and bitter. That only leads to hate and violence. God has a plan for us all. Stay true to him and he will stay true to you. Some Politicians are now just preying on human weakness. They are promoting this Class Envy/Class Warfare stuff to get and hang onto power. It's not healthy for our nation. Turning American against American is just wrong. A house divided will surely fall.

You say don't hate your fellow Americans but have no problem supporting people who go after union workers, and the so called "moochers". And Fox is right up there promoting class warfare, running a story on makers and moochers is a prime example of that.
So please take your hypocritical bullshit somewhere else.

Fox News covers various angles of all issues. You chose only that one angle to focus on. But that's ok with me. That's how you feel. I was just saying how wrong it is for Politicians to promote such jealousy &amp; bitterness towards fellow Americans. It is a deliberate 'Divide &amp; Conquer' agenda. We don't need to turn on each other. That's not the right way to go. Hating a fellow American because he or she is more successful than you will only lead to more hate &amp; violence in this country. I really do hope more Americans turn to God in the future. God Bless and have a good day.
