We had letters and comments in my sons old school about his packed lunch. We tried him on more healthier foods but it got to the point he went without food all day as he didnt like what we gave him. I decided after a few days of this that he'll bloody well eat what he wants and stuff the school (He does have special needs and theres very few foods he will eat and rarely trys anything new no matter how nice it looks).

His new school did send a note just before easter but I replied back explaining we had tried to change his lunch before to no avail and i've heard nothing since. My son has the same food every day and while it's not all healthy, it's what he likes and he doesnt like change. He does 2 lots of swimming a week plus pe twice a week and football after school once a week. Heck he gets more exercise than a lot of adults, so no way would I consider changing his lunch box again. It's to stressful for him and ends up with him going without, as he wont eat school dinners hence lunch box.

I find it disgusting that schools can dictate what children eat if it's not within reason, and it certainly sounds like your childs lunch box was a heck of a lot healthier than their school dinner.

Definately speak to the head, take the same lunch in with you when you go to speak with them to ensure they can see that there is no problem with the meal! It may be worth printing off some info to show how healthy asnd nutritious the packed lunch was.

The bizarre thing is that I am a teacher and last year I did a "healthy lunchbox workshop" with parents and everything that you included (bar the strawberry milk) was actually on our list of suggestions for lunches!!

I'm getting madder as the night goes on rather than calming any.

Having read through the stuff we were given when she started everything states that there is a healthy food "guide" in place. In it it says things like "Try to avoid putting fizzy and/or sugary drinks in your childÂ’s lunchbox."

So why the hell is this TA taking food from children if it's just a guide?! Right appointment will be made in the morning and they'll be getting told not to touch her lunch again. A very pregnant, very hormonal Mum is not a person to wind up!

Jo_R - it's really hard to find things to feed her to make sure she gets all the food groups and things she needs. I'm not vegetarian myself and neither is her father so it's only since she became veggie that I've had to find things. She watched an inappropriate programme at a friends house about the making of cheap takeaways and seen chickens hung for plucking. I get the impression that the school think I'm being daft for "humouring her phase", but she's determined so I'm happy to support it.

Thanks all. I think I might phone the education dept to find their stance on the issue as the school are very rigid on it. The children aren't allowed sugary juices at all and at break-time they are only allowed fruit not a sweet or crisps. I'm wondering though if they are actually allowed to do that.
