Small update-
Its a few months on, and I stopped texting him after Christmas, it was too painful, and i got the impression from other family members that he was starting to 'soften'..as he was asking how i was etc.
then i heard he'd had a bad couple of weeks at Uni, so like a mug I decided to text him, just said sorry to hear what's happened, and I'd like to ring him.
I got a looong text back, basically rtelling me he was 'disgusted' by me, as he thinks I did my best to f up his life.. I really don't get that- the spoilt thing got everything he asked for, I had to put up with all his anger &amp; violence towards family, and stood by him even when he went to court.
Then he said I ' added nothing to his life now'... which made me question, was I only in his life till he could stand on hsi own 2 feet, and then disposed of like an old tissue?!

He's made it clear that he wants nothing to do with me... and I am finding it hard all over again. I feel almost a physical pain, I can't cope with the thought of losing him forever..despite what he has behaved like in the past. It's my other son's 21st birthday soon, we always take the whole family out for dinner, yet this time his elder brother won't come because of me. Plus it's made me think of that son's 21st.. he had a party, and we have some lovely photos of me &amp; him together.
It's Mother's day soon... and sentimental things like that matter to me, and this year I have 'lost' a son.
I sent him a reply asking him to think about what he will do.. does this mean he'll never sttend weddings, funeral,s meet new babies in the family, attend his brother's graduation?

I saved for the last 3 years for both my boys graduation presents, i had Â£1,000 to give my son on grad day, along with a holiday booking <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/frown.gif"/>

Don't know what to do now... as i won't be there.
Breaks my heart to think i did all i could to get him to Uni rather than Borstal, gave him cash/books/laptop etc when he needed it, and I won't get to see the end result, graduation.

Kids really kick where it hurts the most don't they.

I realise now he is being very selfish.. but it still hurts.

I've tried contacting him, and I've tried not contacting him... any other ideas anyone, or should I just give up?

dont do anything at the moment. Get on with your life. He will regret if if suddenly you arent here anymore but thats his problem to deal with.

I have problems with my own son at the moment. I know how you feel. Sick to death of family in general but enjoy life with my partner who is lovely.

No, I don't think he blames me for his dad.. he used to shout that i was useless and thats why he left me.. but deep down he knows that's not true, as his dad became violent, and when he went for the kids one day i threw him out..I darn't even think what their life would have been like if I'd let himn stay.

He was always loved, and had pretty good self confidence, I knew deep down sometimes he was insecure, and i always tried reassuring him I loved him, even when he was at his worst, I always told him I loved him.. and he used to say it back too on the phone from Uni..
Yes, I'm no perfect parent, and have made mistakes, but he's not had an awful childhood, far from it.
He blames me for us being 'poor'... we wern't poor, but I was a single mum, worked, but not a huge amount left for luxuries. he thinks I'm a 'loser' because we lived in a council house and 'he deserved better'.. he said that if I had been a proper parent and bought a house, therefore ina better area, he would have gone to a better school, got better grades, and wouldn't be the skint one at Uni.. and get his rent etc paid like the others. <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/yabb/undecided.gif"/>

I doubt he'd even consider it <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/frown.gif"/>

It sounds really hard for you. <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/frown.gif"/>
Hopefully it is just a phase and he will appreciate his family more in the future. Perhaps he is trying to keep up the joneses at uni, and wants to distance himself from having grown up in a council house <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/redface.gif"/>
Lots of people go through phases in their teens/early twenties when they are embarassed about their parents and/or really do not want to become like their parents, but many eventually grow up and see things in a different light and start to appreciate everything their parents have done for them once they get more life experience.
