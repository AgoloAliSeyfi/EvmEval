@z0z0,

Here is a good book

<img src="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nYmW1w22L._AA240_.jpg" alt="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nYmW1w22L._AA240_.jpg"/>

The New Green is the Old Red.

The Green movement is like a Watermelon - green on the outside and red on the inside.

The Green movement is about anti-capitalism. The desire is to create a world police force which will control energy usage. Anyone that controls energy usage controls the economies of the world.

Read this book - it is very interesting!
Very eye-opening.

@Pinochet73,

But the book is so fantastic.
I wish I had the money so I could send it out to all my nutty friends.

Listen to the first two parts from the audio-book - then go buy your own

@z0z0,

We stood before a mound of rotting, dead cattle, watching the greenhouse-gases escape into the atmosphere. We heard moaning and whimpering inside the heap. We held our noses, and kicked a calf-corpse over to investigate the noise. AND THERE THE BASTARD LAID, FLAT ON HIS BACK, LAUGHING MADLY AT US, WILD-EYED, MAGGOT-EATEN, INTESTINE-FACED, AND STILL....TOTALLY PLASTIC. YEAH....IT WAS FRIG'N AL GORE.

@z0z0,

There we were, pouring gallons of toxic waste into the gutter, drunk, stumbling about, laughing our butts off. Suddenly, we heard a gurgling sound under a nearby manhole cover. When we lifted it, guess who we saw? You got it -- AL 'FUZZ NUTS' GORE, bathing in the chemical sludge, rinsing out his mouth with it, cackling like a frig'n maniac, shouting, "STOP GLOBAL WARMING NOW, AND VOTE FOR ME!!!!!!! HHHHAAAAAAA!!!!!!!"
