I would think Fox News would punish anyone who said anything of the sort. They are #1 and I'm sure they would want to stay there. I don't know anything about Rush Limbaugh.

Strange then that Glenn Beck called Senator Mary Landrieu a "Prostitute" and a "Whore", because she didn't vote the way he wanted her to, yet he was never punished for it.

The burden of proof is on me?

Carbiner claimed the USSC found in the Constitution that a 1st Trimester Fetus has no rights.

I'm still waiting!

YOU make the claim that 1st Trimester Fetuses have no rights and the burden of proof is on me????

That's as stupid as when Dan Rather got caught with those fake National Guard records and claimed his accusers had to prove they were fake.

The sad part is, I bet you think that works!

Yes.

Right after you tell me whether or not it's acceptable to use that sort of, as the OP calls it, MISOGYNISTIC rhetoric against Sheehan.

You claim it's wrong for Schultz to talk that way about Ingraham.

Is it wrong for __________ to talk that way about Sheehan?

</quote>

Oh NICE TRY!

In other words you will provide proof, AFTER I accept a premise NOT IN EVIDENCE???????

Did you think that was going to work????????

I must accept your laughable premise WITHOUT PROOF, before you will provide proof?

This is why you got banned from Hannity!
