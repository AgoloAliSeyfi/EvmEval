What I believe me and the others who are agreeing with me are saying, is this:

The GDP declined SIGNIFICANTLY in this recession: <a href="http://www.google.com/publicdata?ds=wb-wdi&amp;met=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:USA&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=gdp+of+us+graph">http://www.google.com/publicdata?ds=...dp+of+us+graph</a>

It might not look like "a lot" but a trillion dollars is 1/15 of the entire GDP, so I'd say it's significant enough.

On top of this drop in GDP (which affects income GDP, even if revenue as a percentage of GDP doesn't change it means the government earns less), the revenue as a percentage of GDP dropped by about 4%.

This is significant.

Now, NO WHERE DID I SAY THAT THIS IS ONLY A REVENUE ISSUE. I said "ON TOP OF THESE OTHER THINGS (War, one-time spending like bailouts, increasing cost of healthcare, etc), THERE IS A REVENUE ISSUE." (Caps to emphasize)

Corporate income tax, when not taxed, goes where it has been for the last couple years (if you look at top major corps, not a lot of them pay a dime to the gov't), which is basically back into the pockets of the CEOs, CFOs, etc.

Some links showing the intelligence of avoiding taxes or not paying as much as they "should" on the part of corporations:

Mostly because the U.S. tax system is "retarded" and doesn't just outright tax. There's a lot of loopholes that people tend to exploit.

Two things: One, this graph is only on individuals, not on corporations as well. Two: This graph fails to show that there were a lot of loophole closures between 1930 and 2010. Basically: A 90% tax rate back then didn't do anything because it was easier to get away with not paying hardly any of it than it is now with our 35% tax rate.

(graph about % of GPD spending going up)

Yes, spending as a percent of GDP has gone up since the 1700s. I'm not surprised since now we have things like... Roads, firefighters, policemen, a dedicated military, healthcare (which is a huge part of it, and a good reason to pass reform), education especially (which does cost a lot, but is very important).

So yeah, spending has increased, but I'd say a lot of it is for the better.

Like I said, it is not JUST defense or JUST revenue. I said it is a huge combination of things INCLUDING DEFENSE and INCLUDING REVENUE. It includes Healthcare. It includes government workers (I mean senators, not the lowly IRS guy who earns $10.00 an hour), it includes all these things, and yes, 1% at a time does add up, eventually, to 100%.

Does your chart show public companies only, or are private corporations, LLC's and other business entities included?

An interesting feature is that the corporate rate has been constant since 1986 at 35%. (And 46% for much of the time before that)
