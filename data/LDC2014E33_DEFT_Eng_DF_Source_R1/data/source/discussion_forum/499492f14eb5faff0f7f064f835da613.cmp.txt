Wow, he did so much. He "helped" Reagan and Kemp. I'm sure they need it. A lot.

AND, he was "one of the leaders" that defeated communism. Who were the other ones?

I didn't realize he did so much.

AND, he did all that between ethics violations and affairs. AND even made a hundred million dollars. What a guy!

I think that's the point of the thread, Charles.

Al Gore? Tell me what it was he said. Tell the truth now. I can spot a liar from here.

Despite the derisive references that continue even today, Al Gore did not claim he "invented" the Internet, nor did he say anything that could reasonably be interpreted that way. The "Al Gore said he 'invented' the Internet" put-downs were misleading, out-of-context distortions of something he said during an

To claim that Gore was seriously trying to take credit for the "invention" of the Internet is, frankly, just silly political posturing that arose out of a close presidential campaign. Gore never used the word "invent,"

In May 2005, the organizers of the Webby Awards for online achievements honored Al Gore with a lifetime achievement award for three decades of contributions to the Internet. "He is indeed due some thanks and consideration for his early contributions," said Vint Cerf.

Oops.
