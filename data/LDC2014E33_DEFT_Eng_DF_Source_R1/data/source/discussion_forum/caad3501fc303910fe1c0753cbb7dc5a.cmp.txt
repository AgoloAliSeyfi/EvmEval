Bush never claimed Iraq had a bomb. That is left wing lying at its finest. As for stopping Iran, are you saying we were wrong for stopping Iraq from returning to research on the bomb by invading but we should have invaded Iran?

RetiredGySgt, I watched Bush on television saying that Iraq had "weapons of mass destruction". I HOPED he meant the A-Bomb....chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction scared me stiff. HE LIED about that and sat around twiddling his thumbs whilst IRAN acquired nuclear technology.

I despise Bush. I think he and Cheney should be arrested as traitors. Some of my friends have kidlets in active duty over in Iraq and Afganistan...all because of GWB's lies and Cheney's greed to score big contracts from the Dept. of Defense.

How can any patriot defend GWB?

Bush was right. According to everything we and the rest of the world knew Saddam Hussein HAD Biological and Chemical weapons. He never accounted for them and we knew he had them. Further his dual use facilities allowed him the ability to make more.

Provide a single clip ANYWHERE where Bush EVER made a claim Saddam Hussein had nukes. You won't find one. What we were worried about and rightfully so, was that once sanctions were lifted he would only be a couple years away from a bomb. Captured documents PROVE that is true.

Bush nor Cheney lied to anyone, that is left wing propaganda and outright lies. Read the Congressional consent to use force. Bush was very clear why we were going into Iraq.

We have had Democrats in control of both houses of Congress since Jan 2007, they PROMISED if we elected them they would provide proof Bush lied and that he broke laws. It is now 2010 and no such charges have ever been brought forward. In fact EVERY Commission Republican and Democrat that investigated the issue has ruled Bush did NOT LIE.

A quality debate on GWB would take some digging on my part -- flinging POVs won't do any good without facts. If you'd like to, we can start a new thread on him. I didn't mean to hijack this one..I was enjoying the tutoring by you guys on WW II and VJ Day.

My apologies.

Call me selfish, but if it saved even just one American life, I'd have dropped the A-Bomb myself. I am not asking for a pie-in-the-sky ethical debate.

I merely want to know, was it necessary or not? Had Japan surrendered BEFORE we bombed there?

RetiredGySgt says he can prove they did NOT, that he has source documents to back up his position. Well, is there any doubt that he does? Is there some question about these documents?

This is why there should have been a court proceeding. I am just mystified as to why none was ever conducted.

I posted that link because it has a compilation from MAGIC that tells a different story from the Trumanesque Romanticism of using the bombs.

Apologists say it was necessary to use the bombs to get Japan to surrender unconditionally. That's bullshit because even after the bombs Japan did not give an unconditional surrender. After using the bombs it was not Japan that compromised on the conditions of surrender. It was the US. Think about it.

You're quite the dumbass for ignoring what I said:

"I posted that link because it has a compilation from MAGIC that tells a different story from the Trumanesque Romanticism of using the bombs."

I don't know and don't care what else is on the site. The information for MAGIC is independently verifiable. Looks to me like you know you cannot defend your position so you seek a way out, however dishonest, rather than stand your ground.
