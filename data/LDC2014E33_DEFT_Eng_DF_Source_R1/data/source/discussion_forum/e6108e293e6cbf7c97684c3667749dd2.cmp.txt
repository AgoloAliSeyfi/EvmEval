Why do you think that commandment is there?
Lucy goosey sex causes diseases and eventually death. It does not matter what your sexual preference's are.

Leviticus 18:22 reads, "Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination."
Leviticus 20:13. It reads, "If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them."

The verses above from Leviticus are in a section of the Bible that lists immoral acts and the penalties for them. Homosexual activities are listed right alongside other immoral acts such as having sex with animals, incestuous relationships, adultery, etc. God does not say that this behavior is something that you should have "gay pride" about. God calls it a sexual sin and says that because of such practices, the nations in the land were being cast out. Leviticus 18:24, 30 reads, "Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you. Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the Lord your God."

And if we continue to be a nation that allows sex with anyone, any time with anyone. He will turn his back on us and we will no longer have his blessings.
The Majority of this nation believes in God and believes that he will turn on us. This is why homosexuality is a great harm to our society.

This has never been a secular nation, ever.
From the beginning it has been a Christian nation and it still is a Christian nation.
I have lost many gay friends in the 80's and 90's. All of them from HIV.
Most Christians do not hate Gay's, they hate the sin.
I don't write these things to judge anyone. But as a Christian, I believe what God's Word tells me. And I care enough about each of you to share with you God's truth.
I also care about this nation and if we continue down the path that we are going we will most defiantly fall as a nation.

With me it was because being homosexual is unhealthy, but still haven't seen a response to Post #267.
