Texas "gunboats" to patrol Rio Grande border with Mexico
SAN ANTONIO | Thu Mar 1, 2012 6:58pm EST

(Reuters) - Texas unveiled the second of six new 'interceptor' gunboats on Thursday, similar to Navy swift boats that plied the rivers of Vietnam during the Vietnam War, to patrol the waterways of the Mexico border.

The Texas Department of Public Safety, which oversees the Texas Highway Patrol and the Texas Rangers, said the 34-foot shallow water crafts would be deployed on the Rio Grande and the Intercoastal Waterway, which separates the Texas mainland from Padre Island.

"They have night vision capabilities, they have ballistic shielding, and the first couple of boats have fully automatic machine guns," department spokesman Tom Vinger told Reuters.

Vinger said the boats would mainly patrol the Rio Grande, and would be geared toward stopping smugglers of drugs, weapons and illegal immigrants.

4. I don't care about whether or not they stop illegals

It's the drugs that need to be stopped. In the last few months there are starting to be Mexico drug cartel type hits all over S. Texas. There's been 2 in the last two weeks in San Antonio alone. The media won't call it what it is either.

7. "Fully automatic machine guns"? - Do they detect for immigration status, and shoot the undocumented?

Don't mess with the Lone Star Republic Navy.

8. Do they expect heavy fire fights?

Sounds like they are expecting some retaliation from smugglers.

11. I was thinking the same thing.

I thought the Rio Grande was often dry--and that the wetter it was, the lower the levels of smuggling both animate and inanimate contraband.

15. Well it doesn't always reach the Gulf any more.

And the water level is low but I have no idea if they levels are too low for that boat. Some of the lakes (Falcon, Amistad) might be places they will patrol.

10. The terror/drugs/immigrants triple threat is a huge boondoggle.

Billions of dollars for border sheriffs. In some of the poorest counties in the country, sheriffs have so much federal money that each of their deputies has two official vehicles (one patrol car, one SUV). That's Hudspeth County, Texas, according to Ioan Grillo in his book "El Narco."

And billions of more for insane state governors like Rick Perry and Jan Brewer to beef up their police state apparatus, all the while hyping the threat and screaming about how Washington isn't doing anything.

It's a big fucking gravytrain for bullet-headed hucksters like Sheriff Paul Babeu and his ilk. And we're paying for it.

12. Hey,we have to do something.

If this country doesn't do something about all of the Illegal Immigrants, Drug trade, etc coming into this Country, then we are just 10 years from a Banana Republic. I do think there should be some heavy oversight here. I can see this coming back to haunt us!

13. You got it all wrong.

The boats aren't to keep people OUT of the US, they're to keep people IN!

14. I have seen one here in Corpus Christi Bay

I think they will be used all over and the talk about them being on the border is a smokescreen.
