First I don't know how old your kids are and I would never bring them into a convsersation. But assuming they are of legal age, why are you afraid of having gay people hit on them or having a gay roommate?

i had two gay roommates, one of whom died of AIDS and the other i've stayed in touch with for 30 years. both of my children have spent extended vacations with their uncle and his partner for their 13th birthdays. i have no prejudice against gays.

So they're good enough to be your friends, but not good enough to die for this country?

no, i said i don't support changing the policy. i don't oppose changing the policy, either. i prefer to leave military matters to the people who run the military. i served with gays and i never cared one way or the other. still don't.
if obama kept his promise, this would be moot.

Obama cannot revoke the policy alone. The congress has written it into law, and only the congress can repeal it.

Obama has stated his endorsement of such a bill, and hopefully will soon begin pressuring congress to enact it.

If you have no opinion on the policy, then why bother posting in this thread?

In partial answer to your original question, here's <a href="http://talkradionews.com/2008/07/dont-ask-dont-tell-effects-military-cohesiveness/">some testimony by soldiers whose career has been affected by DADT.</a>

<quote>
Retired Marine Corps. Staff Sgt. and first wounded soldier during the Iraq War Eric Alva, stated that trust was the most important bond he shared with his fellow soldiers, and that when he admitted to them that he was gay, trust and cohesion in the group only strengthened.

Joan Darrah, a retired Navy Captain, echoed Alvas sentiments, saying that she was constantly forced to live a double life while serving. After leaving a room in the Pentagon that was destoryed only minutes later on the morning of 9/11, Darrah realized that her partner of 11 years would have been the last to know, had she been killed. Due to the policy, she said that she was very secretive about her life as a lesbian, not even listing her partner as an emergency contact. In addition, Darrah said that the Dont Ask Dont Tell policy actually hurts troop cohesion by mandating the immediate removal of soldiers who are found to be gay.
