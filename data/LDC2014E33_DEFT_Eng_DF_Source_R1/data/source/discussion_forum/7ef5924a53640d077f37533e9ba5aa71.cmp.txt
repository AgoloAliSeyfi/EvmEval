Let me know when RepubliCONZ are willing to pay more in taxes to help raise all these unwanted kids if abortion is made illegal. Or does your concern about "life" only extend to the uterus and not when the kid is squirted into the real world and needs parents who will give a crap about them?

Kind of a weak argument given the long waiting list to adopt

Not really. I've NEVER heard of RepubliCONS asking for a tax increase to pay for a social program.

How many abortions last year?
How many families on the adoption waiting list?

Come up with THOSE numbers and you'll have something.
I already know what they are. I'll let YOU come back and post them and show how WRONG I am. How about that?

You'll find you get what you deserve when you say stuff you DON'T know to be true or not to me.

All you have just told me is that you don't know the man at all. That's ok, since you would not vote for him.

Hyperbole is not logical.

Even the Republicans are not even voting for him: just ask the voters in South Carolina. Have lived in that state, and, he does not have the values of the south period. He will just say whatever to get elected. In fact, I hope he gets elected if Obama does not get re-elected. The Republicans will just hate him.

And you know this HOW?
What's your source?

The 1995 National Survey of Family Growth found that 500,000 women were currently seeking to adopt a child. (Freundlich, 1998)
<a href="http://statistics.adoption.com/information/adoption-statistics-hoping-to-adopt.html">Adoption Statistics: Hoping to Adopt</a>

That's not a million is it?

Again, I say, that you will REGRET saying stuff you don't know for a fact to be true or not, to me.

Mit Romney, now that he is running for president, says he is now pro-life and support the movement  even as a bussinnessman that makes millions from the China policy of one child per-family. With Mit Romney, and the millions of dollars that come busineess in Citizen United rulling: all have a hand in some way or the other with the China policy of the single child policy..
