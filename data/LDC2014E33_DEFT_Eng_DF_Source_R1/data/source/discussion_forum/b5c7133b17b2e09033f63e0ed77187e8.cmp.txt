It's funny all those on here that don't have a problem with the "estate tax" don't have a dog in the fight. I'd wager most are on the govt. dole in some fashion.

As for me I have worked for many years for the wealth I've aquired and my children should reap all the benefits, after all they're the reason I worked my ass off all these years. And for this they should be made to pay taxes on money that has already been taxed?

It's time we get every single liberal puke out of Washington and make government, the government our forefathers invisioned, which is to insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and future generations.

You aren't going to be subject to an estate tax. And if you were, I'd question your values in the claim that your little angels need more than $5 million + 65% of the wealth in excess of that. How are they ever going to learn the value of hard work just like you did?

Yep all income should be taxed exactly the same no matter how you got it.

Even if it's already been taxed once? Tell me, do you pay taxes at the grocery store on the food you buy and then pay taxes again when you eat it?

How many bites of the apple does the gubmint get?

When you buy groceries with your paycheck, that money has been taxed. When the grocery store profits from your purchase, they get taxed. When the grocer buys new furniture with his taxed earnings, the furniture store gets taxed on their profits.

So yes, money gets taxed, generally, every time it changes hands. I don't know why that's so difficult to grasp.

Oh boo hoo hoo!

I'll only get to start out with a sum only equivalant to 100 years the median average PRETAXED incomes of the American family.

That's not fair! wah! wah wah!

What right does the government have to something it had already taxed and taken their (incorrect) 'fair share'? You're right. It is NOT fair to double tax.

I'm not? Can I get a written guarantee on that?

The values my children do or do not learn is of no concern to you. Oh and you're not me.

No you're not right, you say every time money changes hands it gets taxed, but you fail to recognize that money earned and that has been taxed will be taxed a second time upon death per the estate tax. Your comparing money that has been earned, taxed, spent thus being earned by another party, taxed and spent again etc etc... not the same as the estate tax at all.

You fail!

Shouldn't Barney Frank be wrapping his mouth around something else?

Other People's money should not be his concern - look what his Pet Housing Project for the Poor and Downtrodden has resulted in for everybody.
