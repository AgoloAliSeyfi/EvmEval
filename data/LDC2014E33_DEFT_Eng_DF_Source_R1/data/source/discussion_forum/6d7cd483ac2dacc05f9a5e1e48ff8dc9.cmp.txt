power of attorney can be handled locally. Inheritance is a right. Goverment should have diddly to do with it. Taxes should be simplified so that marriage or family relationships are null and void, a non sequitor item.

government should have nothing to do with inheritance rights? really?

damn... and to think every state has trusts and estates laws governing how estates are handled. these issues have always been dealt with by government. rights of dower, courtesy, inheritance,

you claim not to want government interference, yet you're ok with government interfering in the relationship between two people. and it's ok for government to tell me i can't purchase birth control?

i think you might want to work on consistency.

I am not OK with government interfering in marriage. I thought I made that abundantly clear. Marriage is between the individual and God. Government cannot and should not attempt to legislate it. As they should stay out of inheritance and all things marriage related. I trust that my family members would beat the hell out of anyone who tried to take away any property of mine that belonged ot my wife when I leave. If we both left at the same time then survival of the fittest suits me fine. As long as who is left doesn't defile common law rules against violence (the proper place for government) then all is well.

So if marriage is between the individual and God. Then you would have no problem with the government recognizing as equal all religious marriages between individuals and God based on their individual religious organizations view on the subject correct?

That if a same-sex couple is married in a religious institution in accordance with their view of what God allows, that those marriages (which exist today) should be recognized equally with other religious marriages? Or should the government which cannot respect one religion over another under the 1st Amendment, be picking and choosing which religious views are valid. If the government is to be consistent, then it needs to recognize both, if the government can pick and choose then the governemnt is free to ignore Church doctrine and require Catholic organization to cover birth control under insurance.

Either government has to honor religioius doctrine or it doesn't - pick one.

(Personally, I don't have a conflict because their is no one "marriage" and Religious Marriage is separate from Civil Marriage.)

I don't think the government need to recognize anything as pertains to marriage. It is none of their business.
