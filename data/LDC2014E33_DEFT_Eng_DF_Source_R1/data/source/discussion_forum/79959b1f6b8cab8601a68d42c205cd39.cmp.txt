I don't wish death on him...just a massive stroke.

I hope he lives a long time as a veggie before they pull the plug.

Ah. You want him to share your fate.

I am sure it will remind you of a family reunion.

Nope. But they'll be sure to bathe you in ranch dressing, future vegetable.

What they talked about the big waterhead boy?

Damn your an asshole.

He is also a liar and a prick and living off the government.

Nah, I work. My military retirement goes straight to my 401K, so yes I'll be living off the government.

Who the fuck caress?

Lets talk truth.

Truth???

OK.... Sandra Fluke needs to keep her damn legs shut, and stop asking me to help pay for her sexual promiscuity.
Obama needs to tend to presidential shit, and leave Rush alone.
The left needs to listen to what is said from their side of the aisle for a 'CHANGE'.

Hows that for a start?

</quote>

Can you link to Fluke talking about needing birth control for her sex life?

You didn't watch her testimony and you are making a fool of yourself, but keep going.

</quote>

I dont give a shit.... I dont want to pay for it!

If she can afford law school, she can afford her 'pills'.

I GUARANTEE you she probably enjoys her little cell phone.... she can pay for own damn birth control pills.

You are correct. She simply said she needed 1000/year for contraception.

Her testimony was so poorly worded that people assumed she was banging the entire campus.

She's not going to make a very good lawyer.

Last time I checked.... you get prego by having sex.

contraception keeps that from happening in most cases.... then there are those women who use the pill to control hormones... its still birth control, and I dont want to pay for it.
