You are the kind of stupid that there is no coming back from. VA benefits aren't a hand out, they are not welfare, they are earned from time in combat and time in service. You know, fight for the country boom truck hit by an ied wow 200 a month few more times I might have a decent check on my hand.

most every vet I know never saw a day of combat in their lives.

most every vet I met over a certain age, went into the military as a last resort...they were criminals and bums. they got paid and became criminals and bums on leaving military.

then some VA counselor shows up and tells people how to scam the system. just ask any honest vet. It's an open secret

You are seriously a piece of shit and you deserve a brick thrown at your fucking head, straight up.

yeah right. every bum I know has told me they had their discharge upgraded and they get VA benefits.

every time I've volunteered at some homeless shelter or food place some VA guy shows up and tries to sign up everyone.

I've been told how to screw the VA, get benefits and live off the system

wake the fuck up turd boy. I know people who ran the VA and have to keep my mouth shut around them, because like you they are all blind

I hope every vet in this thread neg reps your pathetic non-serving Commie ass.
I sure did.

truth hurts. did I strike close to home?

ask any honest vet. It's an open secret what VA counselors tell the street people to do in order to get benefits.

yeah, e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g must be service related.

bullshit! I know. been there
