Christie Vetoes Gay Marriage

Actually I think government belongs out of marriage. I agree that marriage is between a man and a woman but that can conly be sanctified by God.

Render unto Ceasar what is Ceasar's. In this case I think that is beyond Ceasar's bounds.

I agree. Anyone who has to suck the teat of government to establish they are right probably are in a big stretch.

Interesting when you consider all the important times in life seem to invite a religious element. Most Americans believe in God. Yet, no dignity, hmmm.

Dick Cheney, the former U.S. vice president known for his hard right stance on almost all matters political, is taking a stand in Maryland for gay marriage. Cheney, whose daughter is openly gay, has been lobbying Maryland lawmakers as they debate whether or not to legalize same-sex marriage in the state. Cheney believes states should legalize gay marriage individually.

Yes, you cant violate anothers constitutional rights, voting like prop 8 in cali was just that.im not sure how many times this has to be told to you people, but seriously buy a clue.

Two things.

No ones rights are being violated. "The People" as in, We the People, have every right to amend our Constitution.

I don't know how it is that people can walk and chew gum at the same time if they cannot understand that basic premise.

I've always been a critic of judges who decide they are going to disregard the will of legistlatures and the populace and impose these things, but here's a case where they did it the right way, they passed a bill, and Christie the Hutt decides he's stull sucking up to be RomBot's running mate.

</quote>

The governor wants voters to decide yet polls show that a majority of N.J. voters favor same sex marriage. This veto is a political statement from a governor who needs Tea Party support to move into national politics. His veto simply delays the inevitable.
