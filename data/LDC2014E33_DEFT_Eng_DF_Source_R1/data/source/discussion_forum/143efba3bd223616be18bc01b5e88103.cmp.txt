Israel cannot attack Iran without permission of US who controls the airspace around Iraq, Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, and indirectly through Pakistan.

Iran's nuclear research facilities aren't like Osirak, they are widely dispersed and often up to 200 feet underground. The only way I could see the Israelis carrying out airstrikes is if they launched their attacks from a nearby state such as Georgia, which seems rather far-fetched.

The question on whether Israel can do it alone has come up in a number of threads, and I have not seen the following paper mentioned:

<a href="http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/is3104_pp007-033_raas_long.pdf">http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/..._raas_long.pdf</a>

According to it, YES, they can do it.

"...[the assesment] does seem to indicate, however, that the IAF, after years of modernization, now possesses the capability to destroy even well-hardened targets in Iran with some degree of confidence."

It's incredible that the rest of us are sitting this one out, leaving Israel alone to face the Iranian regime and its terrorist proxies.

Incredible and Shameful.

Same paper, Osirak Redux, but somewhat clearer with maps and illustrations:

I believe that the Iran issue is more of an Israeli problem then it is of the USA or the Western World. The reason being that, should Iran get a nuke in their hands, they would be able to bring the Israelies to the negotiating table by hook or crook. Why?
Because then Iran would start supplying the Hizbollah and even Hamas with sophisticated weaponry. Anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft systems with Iranian marking! In broad daylight! Who's to stop them?
If you try to, you're asking for a nuclear war, which is the last thing that the Israelis and even the majority of the Arabs want.
As for the West a nuclear armed Iran is dangerous because that would mean Iranian hegimony in the Straits of Hormuz and problems to oil shipping. Most of the Middle East's East Coast has a very high number of Iranian origin citizens. In addition to this they belong to the shiite sect of Islam which automatically links them to Iran.
For instance in the Kingdom of Bahrain where the shiites have a larger majority, the Iranians have been for years funding the opposition to overthrow the ruling family. They have also tried other covert operations in the UAE and even Kuwait where they maintain a very strong presence (intelligence). Should Iran get the nukes, these cells would become active and very agressive in their quest to first destabilize and then colonialize the Arabian Gulf and bring it back to what it once was... "The Persian Gulf."
The ruling families of the Gulf states who are all staunch American allies and very very very rich will suddenly find themselves on the recieveing end of the stick as Iran will start arming opposition groups in the Gulf states to destabilize the region. The US and Israel at the point will be powerless as nobody wants to risk provoking a bunch of zealots with nukes.
I say the time to tackle the Iran issue is now. You get it over with by embarking on a limited scale air campaign targetting the nuclear installations. That is the only option.
Yes! It may destabilize the Gulf for a while, but in the long run it will prove to be fruitful. Nukes in the hand of the shiite sect are quite dangerous as all shittes are anti-west and anti-Israel. At least with the sunnis (in Pakistan) or the Gulf there is a balance as the fundamentalists are still a minority.
I say the Republicans need one more term in the office to clear of the mess in the ME once and for all.
