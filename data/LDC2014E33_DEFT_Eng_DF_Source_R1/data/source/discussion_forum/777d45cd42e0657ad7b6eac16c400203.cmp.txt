Christie is within his rights as governor...

Yup and if the Gov in NJ wants to honor Houston then so what. I'm sure he'll hear from the residents of NJ if they don't like it.

NC flew its flags at half staff when Dale Earnhardt was killed and no one gave a shit.

Was he an alcoholic drug addict too? I didn't know that.

Was that a US flag or a Confederate flag?

The Confederate flag is still worthy of respect. The American flag gets crapped on and burned.

By the left. Or hadn't you noticed.

Let me ask you a similarly stupid question.

Did you ask that because she is black and he was white?

For the record I couldn't stand him but your question was beyond idiotic.

Gov Christie has ordered that all state flags in NJ be lowered to half mast this Saturday to honor Whitney Houston

Is it appropriate?

</quote>

No, i do not think it is any way appropriate to lower the flag for an.... entertainer.

Houston was no goddamn patriot and is NOT deserving of such a "communication" of honor.

</quote>

You mean because she didn't anonymously battle evil Liberals on an internet message board like you?

POS.

Personally, I oppose it

Not because she was a drug user but because her primary contribution was a pop music star

I think putting flags at half staff should be reserved for military, police, firefighters, public servants and not for someone who was just famous

</quote>

you know, there was a public school of the arts named for her in NJ. do you know how much money she gave to that school and others? do you know what type of contributions she made to the state? i don't,. btw... and i'm kind of thinking it's a little silly to do this, but it really doesn't change the world.

I honestly don't know. But what I do know is for a generation now we have tried to label bad behavior as a medical condition. That removes any element of personal responsibility and as such we've had a generation of youth drugged by doctors diagnosis's of this ailment or that. It's sad

</quote>

To make the painful decision to inter the appropriate rehab for the condition and stick with it takes plenty of personal responsibility.....As for the OP, not a fan of the Governor by any stretch but I'm fine with the decision.

</quote>

Do you think that rehab works? Did it work for Any Weinhouse? She wrote a song about how it doesn't work. It made her a lot of money. Did rehab work for Charlie Sheen? Did rehab work for Whitney Houston?

Rehab doesn't work. The function of rehab is to teach people how to be more creative in assigning blame for their addictions.

We honor the absolute WORST among us. Schools lower flags to half mast to honor gang bangers who are murdered by other gang bangers.

Whitney Houston was knocking back straight whiskeys at 8AM the day she died AFTER a night of heavy partying. It takes real committment to the lifestyle to find this honorable. Jim Beam might want to lower their company flag to half mast. That I can see. Mexico might want to lower it's flag to half mast. That I can see. There might have been a time when Whitney Houston was a worthy person and could sing. That hasn't been for 15 years at least. At the time of her death she was reprehensible.
