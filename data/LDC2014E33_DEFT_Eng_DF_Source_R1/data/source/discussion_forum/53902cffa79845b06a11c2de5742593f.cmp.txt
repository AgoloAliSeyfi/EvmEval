You do realise that 635 Congresspeople are not all republican, right?

This is a silly thread, that has only accomplished one thing: Continuing the Great American Pastime of Bullshit Partisanism rather than reaching any solution to reducing the size of Federal Government that cannot even keep 12 million Messkins (and maybe a few Islamist Radicals?) from wandering across the border, and spends $13.4 Billion to run the Department of Treasury (2010 Budget) to feed itself.

BOTH the GOP and DNC better get their heads out of their asses....but

Why should they?

As I noted, the graph is from the left of center Washington Post.

The link would have provided you with another aid too...

As I asked, where's the 6 trillion dollars in that graph?

The Bush admin added 6 trillion dollars onto our national debt. Your graph does not show 6 trillion dollars. Therefore it's a false graph.

Not arguing with you on the number, but I wanted to ask. Do you know how the administration got the list of projects included in the stimulus bill?

</quote>

Uh paying off 635 Congresspeople to get it passed?

Why didn't we hear about the deficit during the Bush administration?

</quote>

When not waving the flag, Rush and Hannity bemoaned it quite often. Beck mocked and chided Shrub and the congress constantly. Guys like Boortz and Jason Lewis were going absolutely nuts. Then, there were the dems and their compliant media toadies, who pissed and moaned about it in conjunction with the tax cuts for those eeeeeevil "wealthy" people.

Whoever didn't hear about deficits exploding during Chimpy McShrub's eight years had to have been living on a deserted island, with Gilligan and the gang.

</quote>

in one of the best documentaries i saw on the deficit cnn played almost 30 minutes of unedited ron paul speeches about it to a packaged congress. I agree with having to have been under a rock.

All while thumping their chests about the Bush economy....

You did hear some conservatives bitch about Bush's spending... they were mostly Libertarians or people too embarrassed to admit they were republicans at the time. Everyone else found religion on January 20, 2009.

they were called 'kooks' and anti-american etc. the usual neocon crap
