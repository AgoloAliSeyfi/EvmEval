I think that Glenbeck would like to restore the country to the way it used to be back in 2007.

When he was still only doing radio and not yet hired by CNN? Doubtful. He's made millions being the bash-liberals point guy at Fox. He makes Hannity and O'Reilly almost look saintly.

Ohh so why are people going to waste all that money going to DC when they could mail it to the kids of fallen special forces?

Just mail in what you would spend on bus and hotel, etc.

I did not realize it was a charity event.

Conservatives are the most charitable group in the US. How much have you donated to charity this year?

</quote>

That's nonsense.

Gates and the dummy that owns Birkshire Hathaway are by far the biggest. What someone gives or not is none of your business.

Broken down how? And please don't quote that infamous scientific article of several years ago which was so full of holes it resembled Swiss cheese.

Throughout history America has seen many great leaders and noteworthy citizens change her course. It is through their personal virtues and by their example that we are able to live as a free people. On August 28, come celebrate America by honoring our heroes, our heritage and our future.

Join the Special Operations Warrior Foundation, Glenn Beck, Sarah Palin and many more for this non-political event that pays tribute to Americas service personnel and other upstanding citizens who embody our nations founding principles of integrity, truth and honor.

Our freedom is possible only if we remain virtuous. Help us restore the values that founded this great nation. On August, 28th, come join us in our pledge to restore honor at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC.

now shut the fuck up

Oh that explains a lot, sure. What "virtues" and "values" is he talking about? And why was it necessary to include the word "warrior" to define his latest "special operation"??

Why is it loudmouths like Beck think that only conservative ideologues are patriotic? Morally superior? Most virtuous? He and his minions have set about keeping this great nation divided. If anything, it is that asshole that is UNpatriotic, immoral, and hardly "virtuous" because what he is doing is the most UNAmerican thing that can happen in these troubled times.

and you're a dumbass. so, carry on.

Since no one seems to know, I went and looked it up.

I was unaware that the values that founded this great nation were lost. Perhaps it is a matter of perspective.

You actually see the principles of 'integrity, truth and honor' as high on the priority list of any of our politicians? I sure as hell don't. I see very little of these three qualities generally in the US.... in fact, my impression is that, to many on the left, they're a joke.

</quote>

Yea, the Beckster just exudes the principles of 'integrity, truth and honor' every time he shills for Goldline, a company he's a paid spokesman for. They rip off HIS viewers selling them 'fools gold'; gold coins they sell at 200 times their melt value.

The Beckster; right wing scum...

Among a people generally corrupt liberty cannot long exist.
