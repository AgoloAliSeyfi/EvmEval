Yesterday Glenn Beck spent the entire program talking about how progressive Newt Gingrich was. The way he was talking about him it was like he was actually Barrack Obama. Beck almost sounded like he has lost his mind.

Glenn Beck supports Christian fundamentalists like Michelle Bachmann and Rick Santorum. He feels that Bachmann is his choice for President. Beck doesn't think that now is the time to compromise on our principles. Well, from what I can see, religion is the number one principle that Glenn Beck needs from his candidate.

If any of you don't know, Glenn Beck is a Mormon, or more accurately a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or LDS. I am currently an inactive member of this same church. I have some disagreements with the church. Some would say it is a cult. Harry Reid and Mitt Romney are two prominent members btw. From what I've seen it is a cult, a cult that Beck is a member of. He is a prime example of why Barrack Obama is currently our President. Folks that refused to accept anything other than their idea of a perfect candidate. Someone who has all of the right beliefs and says all of the right things.

I've talked to these types. The type of Christian that doesn't like anyone of other faiths. Christians that have forgotten the teachings of Christ or never learned them. Love thy brother as you would love yourself...regardless of his beliefs or his race.

Glenn Beck doesn't support Newt because he thinks his immigration policies are too progressive. He accuses Newt of being too progressive when it comes to health care. He's also another one of these nut cases that mistook what Newt said about Paul Ryan's plan claiming he actually wants GOP social-engineering, which is far from the truth. Newt merely said he would not exchange Democrat social-engineering for Republican social-engineering.

Glenn Beck has already made up his mind. He supports Bachmann, and he supports Santorum, but now he even says he'd rather vote for Ron Paul over Newt Gingrich. This is insane. Glenn Beck would rather lose another Presidential election then compromise on his crazy principles. After listening to him yesterday I got the impression that Beck is slowly losing his fricken mind. The way he was talking about Gingrich it sounded like he was describing one of the most evil politicians ever to walk the face of the Earth.

I believe Beck doesn't understand the way Newt thinks. He's totally misinterpreting his beliefs and thus doing a disservice to his candidacy and doing his best to usher in another 4 years of Barrack Obama. I don't think Beck really cares right now if this happens and that he may be one of the primary reasons it does. I'm not gonna voice my thoughts on what exactly is causing Glenn Beck to be so vocal about Newt or George W. Bush in the past. However I can say that it seems like he's doing more damage to his own professed cause than good.

Hmmmm... I LIKE Glenn Beck. I had always thought he was one of the better looking men in broadcasting... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/> I do NOT always agree with what he says or his angles, but he seems to break things down on his show in such a way that the least informed can potentially better understand... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/new/dunno.gif"/> There are times he's been laughable... but it is so with most any politically based show, I suppose. Even the Washington Journal has some callers.... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

Since I don't pay any attention to Beck, I have no idea who he supports or why. Nor do I care. What I can tell you, hand on heart.... Hell will freeze over before I'd vote for Gingrich. Romney, I could grit my teeth, hold my nose, and vote for - purely for his economic experience. We need smart businessmen, not career politicians.

Every time the GOP has to pick a candidate to run for POTUS we see the same thing happening.

They use the same sleazy character assassinating techniqes on their fellow Republicans that they use against the Dems.

Really, folks, the GOP is a party with a servere character disordered problem in that respect.

Remember when the big lies propagandists turned on one of their own who also happened to be a US Military triple amputee to accuse HIM of being a terrorist sympathizer?

I mean seriously...how vile is THAT?

The GOP is the party of character asssassination, big lies and big propaganda.

The Dems have their own underhanded techiques for internacine wars, of course, but the GOP really has the emotional and ethical IQs of a school yeard filled with 8 year bullies.

Ravi, honey, I criticized the media spin on his words. That doesn't mean I agree with him, or know who he does or does not support.
