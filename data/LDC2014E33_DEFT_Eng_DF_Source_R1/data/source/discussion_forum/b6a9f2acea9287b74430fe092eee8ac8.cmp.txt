The show is just propiganda. They want to show us how Muslims are misunderstood victims.

Next time i need to shop for some tools, fuck home depot, i'm going to lowes.

IMO, Lowes is way better anyways, I appreciate their position but they have what I need all the time unlike Home Depot...

Sometimes they both suck...lol.

I needed a spotlight fixture for my Christmas lights (just the holder on a spike). Lowes was out. Home Depot was out. Sears was out. Target was out. K-Mart was out. The little mom &amp; pop True Value a block from my house that I never shop at had about a hundred in stock. Sure, they were $3.00 more than the others would have been... but they HAD them.

<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/11/showbiz/all-american-muslim-lowes/index.html">Lowe's pulls advertising from TLC's 'All-American Muslim' - CNN.com</a>

Lowes pulled an ad they had placed on All-American Muslim essentially claiming that the show was to controversial. Now they are getting a lot of flack claiming that they are upholding an anti Muslim bigoted attitude. As I understand it, the show is based around AMERICAN Muslims and the struggles they are facing in a post 9/11 America. While I have no issues with how Lowes decides to advertise, this does seem like a bone headed move particularly considering that I would have never even known about the show in the first place until Lowes created this controversy. Many people are now calling Lowes Bigoted for this move.

Your thoughts?

I'm certain the entire hypocritical land of left wing lunatics will label Lowe's bigoted and are even threatening a boycott. This is a free country. Lowe's should be able to spend their advertising dollars when and where they want to without being accused of bigotry. I'll continue to make it my store of choice when I need home improvement.

C'mon, how many of the progressives that are outraged over this do you think can even swing a hammer? Or have the ambition too?
