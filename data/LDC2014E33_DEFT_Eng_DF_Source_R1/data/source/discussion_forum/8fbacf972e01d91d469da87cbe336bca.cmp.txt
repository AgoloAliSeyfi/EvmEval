All I have to say about the illegal immigration laws is: don't bitch when food prices double or triple. <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/tongue.gif"/> Seriously though - I understand both viewpoints to some extent. I feel it is unfair to those who DO go through the process, but I feel for the mother/father who wants a better life for their child. I also have a hard time with all the money spent on taking care of those here illegally but also feel they do contribute and work damn hard. Here in the central valley you see illegals picking fruit in 100+ weather in long sleeves for 12 hours. You couldn't pay me enough to do that - I would probably have a heat stroke and die. I appreciate their role in society but part of me does think that once you get here, go through the process and become legal. Try to learn the language - that does not mean abandoning your culture. It's just common sense. So I agree with parts from both sides I guess. <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/confused.gif"/> Don't really know what the solution is.....

Bring on increase in food prices! Companies that hire illegals should be the very first that see the crack down. The should be fined heavily. The problem with the neighboring states is a good percentage of the illegals that come over are committing crimes. Let me give you and example, do you know what the number one place in the world to kidnappings take place? Mexico. Do you know what number two is? Phoenix. That right Phoenix, AZ.

One more thing....

(ha ha- me on my soap box)

I don't see anything wrong with wanting local sustainability. I think its what our country needs right now.
These large corporations pay pennies for migrant non-immigrant (illegal) workers to harvest our food. In turn these workers send their earnings back to their home countries to provide for their families there. Those families in the other country put our American money into their local economy.
The product is also shipped to many other countries at a lower price than it would sell for here.
The money needs to be put back into our loop. By paying American workers true wages so that they can in turn support our own local economy.
The best way this happens is on Main St., Anytown, USA. Where local farmers raise their own crops and livestock and sell it back on the streets - for fair prices. Everyone can compete freely and fairly at the farmers market. Or at locally owned supermarkets.
Money cycles through, profits are made, and the American worker/owner can spend their money back in their town, giving profits to others.

Its blissful and unrealistic. Because currently large corporations will not be stopped as they conquer the globe. They are the ones promoting the influx of illegal immigrants into our country. If we were a locally sustainable economy- the draw would not be so good for one to sneak in here and get immediate work. We wouldn't be having this problem if these corporations only hired legal residents at true wages.
Its unrealistic also- because farmers have to compete with the super low prices of places like Wal-Mart. They are forced to pay their workers lower wages and possible hire them illegally to be able to stay alive in the market.

This is also the reason we are suffering for American jobs when it is just cheaper for a corporation to pay a worker in India to do the same job. The quality of the work goes down and we are spilling our money into another country's economy.

Bah. I am going to keep at this all day.. <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/mad.gif"/>
