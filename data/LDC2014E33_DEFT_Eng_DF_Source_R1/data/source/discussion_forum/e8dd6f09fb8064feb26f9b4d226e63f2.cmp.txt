Can you link to Fluke talking about needing birth control for her sex life?

You didn't watch her testimony and you are making a fool of yourself, but keep going.

</quote>

I dont give a shit.... I dont want to pay for it!

If she can afford law school, she can afford her 'pills'.

I GUARANTEE you she probably enjoys her little cell phone.... she can pay for own damn birth control pills.

</quote>

You are a fucking idiot. She never talked about her sex life. But keep showing how utterly dumb you are.

As a general rule of thumb, it is not prudent to take anything said by a militant hack like Salt Peter at face value.

In his particular instance, however, I have to note that he has a bit of a point. There is one line in her testimony which makes it possible to assume that she was talking about women, including herself.

<quote orig_author="Ms. Fluke testifying before Nancy Pelousy and Congrssional Democratics">
Without insurance coverage, contraception, as you know, can cost a woman over $3,000 during law school. For a lot of students who, like me, are on public interest scholarships, thats practically an entire summers salary. 40% of the female students at Georgetown Law reported to us that they struggle financially as a result of this policy.

</quote>

But, read in it's entirety (I prefer the written format over the video), it does appear that she spoke almost entirely of OTHER women.

Last time I checked.... you get prego by having sex.

contraception keeps that from happening in most cases.... then there are those women who use the pill to control hormones... its still birth control, and I dont want to pay for it.

</quote>

Don't worry. You'll be gone soon.

No. I don't think it's a stretch at all. She left herself open to some misinterpretation. But since she was pontificating as a representative of an advocacy group, I think it's fair to read her a bit more literally. And in that vein, with the exception of the portion I highlighted, she was clearly talking about other women.

The import of what she was advocating (whether she is sexually hyper active or totally celibate) is still facially absurd. But that's a different kettle of fish.
