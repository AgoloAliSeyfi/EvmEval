Why didn't we hear about the deficit during the Bush administration?

</quote>

Because democrats don't even pretend to give a shit about the deficit.

And republicans only do when a democrat is in the white house.

That's bullshit.

Democrats are for pay as you go. Clinton did it. Obama called for it last night.

Don't tell lies.

And Bush let PAYGO expire because it was cramping his budget-busting style.

Tomorrow is the State of the Union and Obama will be talking about the huge deficit we have. Why didn't we ever hear about it during the Bush admin when during his admin the national debt was more than doubled? The deficits were huge!

But Bush hid them. He didn't put the two wars in the budget like Obama is doing. Remember all those emergency supplementals that congress voted on every few months? 250 billion here, 500 billion there, to fund the wars. We don't have those anymore, because the wars are funded, out in the open, by the budget.

But now, we see the deficit spending that these wars are causing, and suddenly everyone's all outraged.

This money has been draining our treasury for 8 years already.

The 2009 debt number is from the Bush administration's fiscal year. When they post the 2010 numbers, that will be Obama's.

So I was just wondering why the media is so stupid? They keep talking about the huge deficit in the Obama admin. But they never mentioned the doubling of the national debt under the Bush admin. Are they really so stupid that they didn't realize all those war supplementals weren't in the budget and therefore hidden away each year?

Get over yourself huh? We DID hear about the deficit. Every time Bush spent a dime.

Here's some late-breaking news: Bush isn't President. Get over it. It doesn't matter what Bush did. It is irrelevant to your boy outspending Bush's 8 years in one year.

Thanks for proving your dishonesty, since you're not an admin, you cannot see our IP addresses.

Now I'll be sure to remember never to believe anything you say, going forward.

I love it when people make this perfectly clear early on. Less wasted time.

He's a mod... he can check you IP whenever he wants....

Oh. Thanks.

Isn't it supposed to say mod next to the names of all the mods, so everyone will know who the mods are?

</quote>

No. They can change their tagline just as quick as you can change yours. Their names are in orange, tho, with Admins being in red.

Might want to brush up on rudimentary reading/comprehension skills prior to blowing your gasket, tho. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_whistle.gif"/>

The Democrats may be saying they are for pay as you go but they don't seem to be doing anything about it.

The White House's own projections have budget deficits of $500+ billion for the next 10 years.

They play lip-service to pay as you go....but since the deficit is already over 1.4 trillion and they're trying to raise the debt ceiling to 14.5 trillion.....I don't think they can possibly be taken seriously.
