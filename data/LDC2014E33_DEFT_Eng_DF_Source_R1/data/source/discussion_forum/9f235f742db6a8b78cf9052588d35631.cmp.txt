There is a difference between disallowing a behavior and forcing someone into a behavior.

</quote>

So the church is disabllowing its members from using birth control, the punishment for doing so will be the loss of entry into heaven. How is that different than forcing a behavior?

</quote>

If that were true, you'd have a point. But it is not, so you don't.

Another fail. You're on a roll! Good luck with that! Rick will be proud.

It was a question, not a statement of fact. The church does prohibit birth control, does it not? Is the use of BC something one must confess to return to a state of grace? If this is true, one must conclude (if they are honest) that such is a form of power and control over the freedom of the individual, for without grace entry to heaven is problematic.

As said by many, if you can't afford a dollar for a condom, you have two choices. 1) keep it in your pants or 2) keep your legs closed... Depending on you sex.

To force a church to go against its beliefs just so some poor fool can have sex without danger of getting a girl pregnant makes so little sense I can't believe people here are even defending it. The redirect to world poverty... Water shortages... The church.... Not a single word said about the idiocy of someone that poor thinking about mating.

If you want to take away religious freedoms, you better come up with a better plan then 'but I can't afford a $1 condom'

maybe churchs shouldnt operate hospitals then. if they have a problem with performing or providing certain services that are part of that business model, then maybe they shouldnt be in that business to begin with.

why would an intelligent person get involved in a business in which parts of it could violate their beliefs? that would be like a devout muslim opening a liquor store but refusing to sell booze.

I guess I should have editted in 'business discussion or hospital running to the redirect comment in my original post

Wry's point is.... that not suggesting or providing contraceptives in countries like this, only exacerbates the problem that they are trying to fix. Why would you support giving birth to more babies into such desperate squalor.

Good grief, stop it. Now I must give you a positive rep.

You have already passed me out..please don't try an kill me off.

The church is not the one who decides who goes to heaven or hell.

The church's doctrine does not permit birth control but it does not use any force to get the congregation to comply. They leave that up to the individuals own conscience and consequence.

The Catholic Church is opposed to contraception for moral reasons.

Where is the morality in creating a life when food and clean water are rare commodities? Where poverty exists and educational opportunities are non existent?

Where is the morality when disease is spread?

Where is the morality when a women is the victim of domestic violence? When a women is forced to conceive and then trapped as the child become a lever to gain more power and more control?

Why is it literally 100% impossible for the liberal mind to understand that just because you don't want government involved in something doesn't mean you're against it?

I'm in favor of feeding, clothing, and giving shelter to the poor. I'm against all the gov't institutions that tax our brains out and who inefficiently attempt to provide some of these things.

Now am I just a genius who doesn't know it, or is it really not THAT hard to understand such a simple concept?

</quote>

No you're not a genius, though the ability to hold two contradictory beliefs suggests something, something other than genius. Parse you second paragraph and maybe you'll understand my point.

</quote>

Alright, by all means please use your liberal mind to help my simple brain understand this concept.

I willingly give money to charities to help the poor+speak out against gov't institutions that take away the aspect of choice and aren't as efficient as charities=I'm against giving money to help the poor, even though that's exactly what I did.

Please please help me understand that equation.
