I have only ready the first two pages, but had to write right away because OMG.... I could have written almost exactly the same than you. Like you and husband, my partner and I earn just over £90K. Like you, we live in the SE and like you we deal with a VERY expensive housing market. I think most people here are completely clueless at the differences in the cost of living. A three bedroom semi in nice but not best area in our town start at about £260 and that's not even as expensive as some of the nearest towns.

Like you, i work full-time, except in my case, I can't say I enjoy it. It used to be challenging is a nice way, but now it is only pressure, stress and slavery. They have relacated our office three times in 6 years now, and I have to travel 1 hour 15 minutes morning and evening. I too have two children, and do all the drop off/pick ups, as organising the holidays and everything else relating to them. My partner is not their dad and their dad is useless, so can't help that much. Like you, I am absolutely shattered and feel I have no life, and I too feel bitter that I don't get to enjoy our money because once everything is paid, we don't have that much disposable income. I know it might sound incredible to many, but it is the reality. Once we have paid the mortage, the bills, childcare (no help), there isn't that much left. The main reason is that we are repaying our mortgage so that we have paid everything in 7 years. That's my partner's decision, not mine, it does cause issues in our relationship, but it is one thing my partner won't buldge on. I see his point, I just wish we could enjoy our money more. Like you, holidays are at family homes abroad, and like you, although I am grateful for it, it is more a resting holiday than an exciting one. I look at the cost of everything when I do my weekly shopping at Tesco, I now shop exclusively in charity shops, my children only get clothes from supermarkets and only when they are on sale! I go to get my hair done two or three times a year, have never had a manicure, padicure, self tan or whatever else you can spend your money on! Like you, my friends either don't work or only work part-time and seem to enjoy a lot more things that I do, and I to wonder some time how they do it, although I know for a couple of them, they received quite a decent inheritance, others are quite into debts, and others have remortgage their house many time. So ok, we are more responsible, but I am not sure it is so worth it.

I can't give up my job. So for anyone who reads how wonderful life would be earning over £45K, believe me, if you live in the SE, once you've paid for your taxes and receiving nothing back, you are not as rich as you might think. Of course you have the luxury of not having to worry how you going to put food on the table or pay the next electricity bill, but you usually don't get where you are without having worked very hard for it, and the exhaustion that can come with what such a salary entails is not always worth it.

As I said above, as you haven't read the whole thread you might be unaware that the OP's salary from her full time job sits untouched in the bank each month - so your circumstances on the surface seem similar but if you were in her situation I think you might think 'stuff the job' would you not?

Resenting part time &amp; SAHM is ridiculous.
You &amp; your husband have made your choices &amp; now you have to live with them.
Obviously paying off the mortgage quickly is far more important than quality of life.
Most Part time &amp; SAHMs make lots of sacrifices to be with their children.

Unfortunately resentment, along with jealousy, bitterness and anger, is one of those emotions we can't help feeling! Telling people not to feel the way they do is pretty much one of the most unhelpful things you can do!

Also, as this poster didn't read the whole thread they will be unaware that the OPs monthly wage sits untouched in the bank, so their situations are not so similar after all!

Actually, our situations are VERY similar. I couldn't believe how similar they are, in fact.

My main salary sits in the bank because I haven't got mortgage yet to pay off so I am not spending it. But if we are to take out the mortgage we are aiming for repaying it in full would amaizingly too take us 7 years (honestly, I did calculations).

That's what I was thinking of doing too.
