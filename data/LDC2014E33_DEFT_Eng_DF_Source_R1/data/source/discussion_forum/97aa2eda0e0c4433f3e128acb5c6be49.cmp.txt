These are just musings..but lately there's been alot of frenzied activity from recruiters. And I just went to the office party of my old job and while talking to some of the guys there, many people who were looking for a year or more are getting snapped up.

What's going on?

Well aside from the economy getting better, the Bush tax cuts are set to expire. And there's not much evidence they did anything to help. Employers are sitting on tons and tons of liquidity and playing "shell games" to keep making money..without adding to the overall economy. Given the present anger in the public at large, I have a feeling that to quell some of this..there will be a hiring boom.

and why would an employer hire new employees that he may have to lay off later and then know he's going to have to pay unemployment benefits for a lifetime? who in the hell would knowingly do that?

Has the amount of millionaires and billionaires in this country gone up or down in the past 30 years?

Seriously..come into the real world.

The country producing more millionaires should be celebrated, but that's jmo.

A company that hires through a temp service.

A temp service always has 2 customers, at least.

One to bring people in for the pay.
And one that just sucks that almost no one will take.

When the big payer ends, the temp co can offer the worker the shitty job, hoping they won't take it, so it's a voluntary quit and thus no UE&gt;

In other words - Sallow is hoping for another mass bailout and enormous government spending. But no worries...Obama wants to cut 3 $trillion out of the deficit in 10 years (which will of course increase the deficit not decrease it)

Actually..some states are doing what the Fed won't..and adding Stimulus. New York State just wrapped up a huge deal with Cornell..

And Cuomo kiboshed the idea of killing the millionaire's tax in favor of putting together a package of infrastructure projects. And walking around the city you can see construction is booming.

I assume you have noticed that colleges have been in a massive growth boom for the past 7-8 years. School construction has never been better.
And who could be surprised?
We are just now beyond the height of the education bubble created by the government. And it will burst. And it will be ugly when it does.
I would think you would not be in favor of this. I would assume you don't like how tuition has ballooned in the past decade?

It's no "bubble". The world comes to the United States to educate it's people.

The United States Colleges and Universities are top flight..bar none.

Personally, I am seeing some fairly significant movements in the Real Estate market. It appears the stockpile of the foreclosures is finally beginning to disappear. Plus, commercial investors are coming back to the table. 2012 may be a year of unexpected recovery.

Great time to add another fee to those taking out mortgages then.
