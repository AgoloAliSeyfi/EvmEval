Definately not. It's a degrading "occupation" to do. Who would practise it safely? Prostitutes just get beaten and abused. What about all the men who have 1 arguement with their wives and end up "having an affair" with prostitutes out of anger. The majority of prostitutes themselves admit they only do it out of necessity to either buy drugs etc. To actually call it a career is a joke.

Absolute rubbish, you clearly know nothing about the industry.

Why only for women?? Why not for men as well? Is it weird that this is what annoyed me most about this thread? If you see this as such a beneficial path then both sexes should be included. I am also interested to know how exactly you propose we go ahead and promote it...make degrees out of it? Talk to children about its benefits???

You can't "educate" people to change what they are sexually attracted to.

women are attracted to men...but there is a weird social convention that it is not as terrible for a man to go to a prostitute, whereas the other way around is unthinkable. The same way that there are men out there desperate enough to sleep with prostitutes, I am sure that there are women who feel the same.

In any case, your argument is ridiculous, you still haven't answered how you propose to promote prostitution. Flyers maybe? Advertising?

Mods: do not delete this. Prostitution is LEGAL in the UK.

Thankfully, prostitution is just about legal in the UK (though the safety of women remains horribly endangered by the continued illegality of brothels, which also stifles the freedom of entreprenuerial agency/brothel owners).

However, prostitution receives very little promotion in our society, and is in fact actively discouraged. Thankfully, a large number of talented women still pursue this lucrative career.

But in order to maximise the talent pool available to punters, as well as to allow women to maximise their earning potential, I believe prostitution, along with associated professions such as domination services, should be actively promoted through careers services in schools, as well as in the media. Furthermore, men may also be encouraged to experience the joys of punting, thus increasing the income of prostitutes and ensuring that supply does not outstrip demand.

Of course, health and safety is paramount at all times, and we must also therefore encourage women to always use condoms when providing such services, receive regular STI tests and take necessary precautions to minimise contact with potentially dangerous clients.

A positive by-product of all this would be to reduce unemployment among males. The avenue of prostitution is sadly not a lucrative one for heterosexual males due to a dearth of female clients. Therefore, an increased number of prostitutes would increase job opportunities for males during these tough economic times.

In conclusion, we should promote prostitution as a career choice because:
1) it will reduce unemployment
2) it will encourage entrepreneurship
3) women can earn upwards of Â£120 per hour, thus allowing them to work less and increasing their opportunities to do other things, which will in turn lead to economic benefits to other sectors.
4) by legalising and regulating brothels alongside this we can increase the safety of sex workers and reduce sex trafficking.
5) we can improve the sexual capabilities of both males and females, thus leading to increased enjoyment among the population
6) we can encourage safe sex thus reducing the spread of STIs
7) we can lead the way among Western societies in normalising prostitution thus reducing prejudice against sex workers.

OP, Should we promote prostitution as a career choice for men?

Right, and have you ever spoken to any prostitutes?
Women are not robots, they do not all feel the same way about things.

How is being anti-prostitution "defending women"? Women should be allowed to do whatever they damn well like with their bodies.

</quote>

yes it is actually women being exploited by perverted men like yourself is sex slavery so believing in anti-prostitution is defending women.

Women can do as they wish with their bodies but their are certain boundaries so you don't treat a women like a rental property and sexually exploit her.

How can you sit their think this way about women imagine it was your mother being treated like a sex toy how would you feel?

Women should be able to do whatever they like with their bodies.
