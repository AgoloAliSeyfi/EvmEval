in this case, Wa Bluska, the government is genuinely fucking things up with their subsidies. It's not the concept of subsidies per se, but the nature of the subsidies themselves.

Not all government is bad, not all government is good. It's a human endeavor. Go fucking figure. Anyone telling you regulation is always bad or always good is full of it. It's like being against hammers. They are just a tool that can harm or help depending on how they are wielded.

Notice how retarded Fyrenza sounds? it's not because he is stupid, it's because there is so much faith and so little critical thinking in his rantings. And yet, he can be right sometimes. Neat, eh?

my original post was only concerned with the paradox of governmental ag research and water projects in the service of anti-government local farmers

anything else is beyond my ken

the farming here is sugar beets, potatoes, hay, mostly, some wheat and barley too? [i think, i might be missing something] plus of course cattle

none of the high-profit fruits and nuts that some other states have

the sugar beet profits in particular are so hairline-thin that ag research is the only reason any sugar beets can be grown in this cold desert

there is plenty more that could be grown there, in a market not so hopelessly skewed by current subsidies.

I think your local farmers are onto something. They have wisdom in their own way.

In the future farming will become an endeavor of the highly educated (not necessarily degrees, but real education). Either that, or our food system will collapse and our population levels will have to adjust. There is a place for government in all that, but subsidies for monoculture are not the answer.

actually i think the thing that gets most farmers through another year of misery is the oil leases

the two famers i talk to the most also work for the post office in order to keep the damn things going

my cat litter farm is the prizewinner!

Most all large farmers are controlled by the gov..
They claim to be self sufficient in a way they are they make a living off of their own land but their products and what they can sell them for is so controlled.

Most of the farms on the northern plains are HUGE..
I think it is just hard in a northern climate you can only grow so many things and it has to be on a massive scale and sold to a huge market which is manipulated by big brother.

Big farmer kind of annoy me, they always claim to be broke and hardly surviving because of the government sucks, but they are always collecting government money.

Then they are always winning they are to poor to pay more then $2.25 an hour for illegal labor if they do they will go bankrupt. But they have new truck every year, a huge custom and all their kids dive nice cars and go to state collages. <img src="images/smilies/cool.gif"/>
