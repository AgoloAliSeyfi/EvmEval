First, UScitizen, there are smart cuts, and there are not so smart cuts, so quit acting stupidly.

What does concern me about this is China's involvement in their space program. This is the unknown factor, that could come back to bite us in a big way. What I'm talking about is a miltary weapon they could develop, and we would be decades behind in nuetralizing the threat. just a thought.....

why would China want to kill the people that are making them prosporous?

Did I say in the decade? I'm looking 25-45 years out. Why do you just look at tomorrow?
I bet you were never good at chess, were you?

Why don't you start acting like it then? Instead of thinking about your next move, think 4-5 moves ahead. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_whistle.gif"/>

Can anyone explain to me how the Russians have "caught up" ?

- We have the most powerful Air Force (and Naval Air) on earth
- We have the most advanced avionics
- We have the best missiles
- We have the best intelligence
- We have air superiority in any theater on earth

The Russians tried for 50 years to keep up with us and they couldn't. What makes you think they are our equal now or anytime in the forseeable future?
