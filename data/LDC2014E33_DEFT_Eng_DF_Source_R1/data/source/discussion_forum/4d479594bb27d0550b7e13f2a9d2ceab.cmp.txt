What have the poor done to deserve our support?

Don't talk to me. Talk to your "Jesus".

The only problem with your point is that you have not yet learned to distinguish between Charity and Forced Compliance. Learn to give voluntarily, from your Heart RD.

Now give me your wallet, with everything in it. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/> Give me a big smile and a hug too. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

Idiot. There are some people in between jobs. That happens. FWIW local churches and other benevolent orgs are far better equipped to deal with those situations than the gov't.
But that's not what I'm talking about. I am talking about the perpetual non-working, who continue to receive benefits as a right.
As to your rant, during most of Bush's tenure the UE rate was about 5%. Meanwhile there was lots of off shoring going on. So off shoring does not cause job loss. Actually for every job exported three more are created domestically.
In the 1980s you doubtless did not have a cell phone (few people did). You ached for the time you could get 10 cents a minute for calling. Today your calls are largely free based on a flat rate and you can make them almost anywhere.

OH, so you are talking about the Welfare Queen that Reagan talked about that didn't really exist. Are we going to talk about unicorns next? Lepruchauns?

The Unemployment rate isn't that important. a 5% unemployment rate where everyone has McJobs isn't an improvement. I would much rather have the Clinton UE of 3.9% where you could throw out a resume and get a better paying job in a month that you barely qualified for than the 6.3% UE of Bush where you couldn't get a job you totally qualified for because you were competing against 40 other guys who were just as qualifed.

Offshoring replaced good paying manufacturing jobs with service McJobs. That was NOT an improvement, guy. Bloodletting is not a valid medical treatment, either. We send out 500 billion in wealth every year to other countries, that's not a good thing.

I am talking about generations of unemployed and unemployable people. Don't tell me they dont exist. You ought to know better.
Your comparison of the Bush years with the Clinton years is a joke. But I have effectively refuted your point: off shoring was going like crazy during hte Bush years and there was more manufacturing going on here and less unemployment.
I am sorry you cannot compete against guys more qualified than you. Night school maybe?

Clearly we need the poor to have money in their pockets so they can buy our goods and services.

And the rich use them to build their empires.

When did a poor person ever create a job? Last time he had money in his pockets. Before Bush took office. That's when.

</quote>

Now that's circular thinking. You answered your own question in your first sentence. The 'poor' create jobs through their spending habits.

</quote>

Um, no they dont.

In frequent threads here the brain-dead leftists moan about how the "idle rich" (like there is such a thing) don't deserve their money. But look at the other side. The poor in this country enjoy a lifestyle envied by even middle class people in most of the world. What have they done to deserve this? The idlest of the idle rich invest money and help other hard working people get ahead. The poor simply absorb tax payer funding and have babies.

You should ask all the Christian Churches who give millions to the poor in one form or another.

If the poor do not deserve such charity, then Christianity is a religion with a very serious fundamental flaw...

...to the point, perhaps of being an enabler of sloth and irresponsibility.

There is no 'reward' criteria implicit in charity pr charitable acts:

<quote>
char·i·ty   /ˈtʃærɪti/ Show Spelled[char-i-tee] Show IPA
noun, plural -ties.
1. generous actions or donations to aid the poor, ill, or helpless: to devote one's life to charity.
2. something given to a person or persons in need; alms: She asked for work, not charity.
3. a charitable act or work.
4. a charitable fund, foundation, or institution: He left his estate to a charity.
5. benevolent feeling, especially toward those in need or in disfavor: She looked so poor that we fed her out of charity.
