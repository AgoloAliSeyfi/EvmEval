Interesting. You actually admit you don't know what Obama did or did not do and yet, despite admitting that you don't know all the facts, you have decided that BP are responsible. What a fucking moron.

It doesn't really matter what Obama did or did not do, BP is legally responsible, it their fucking oil you dumb bitch. I'm sorry you don't know the law, not my fault. I sure hope legal aide isn't your career goal.

My point is that he does bear some responsibility. No matter whether it turns out to be BP's or Transocean's fault or, as is more likely, a combination of both, the President did not regulate before he agreed the drilling.

I am fascinated that the rabid left refuse to recognize that. You can bet your last dime that, if there was a GOP POTUS, they'd be howling for his blood.

So does the President bear responsibility for every single tort that happens under his watch?

Did he, or did he not, agree to the drilling. Him. Personally. Not that he left in place an agreement from the previous administration.... but he, as an actual individual. He agreed the drilling. He could have regulated and chose not to.

Fucking idiots who cherry pick for partisan politics are scum. That's you.

Great... Then this question should be reasonable. Where is the timeline in all of this?

A rig just doesn't appear out of no where...or no when. When was the rig placed? When was the lease leased? So on and so on... Strangly a COMPLETE and coherant timeline seems difficult to google. Without one blame is impossible to lay.

Ignore the baggy cunt SpidermanTuba. She just flaps her gums anytime I post to attempt to annoy. Iggy is on this page, under Quick Links.

The seepage is not a POV...for she has none. It's all about the vagina envy with California Girl.

How about we prohibit off-shore drilling TOTALLY? Make the oil companies dismantle the freaking rigs? Given that the Alaska Pipeline is now like 30 years old and has a decent track record, "DRILL IN ALASKA" together with a REAL push towards reducing energy waste?

I happen to think if Tom Hayward got the needle, fewer oil spills would occur. Even making him do a 20 year stretch would have the desired detterent effect. I bet that would chill a helluva lot of reckless conduct. Merely because a regulation hammered out by Big Oil's lobbyists says something is adequate does NOT alter the laws of physics...a thing which explodes and belches millions of gallons of oil on the oceans is NOT SAFE.

I would have a freaking solar power thingie on my roof if one were available at a cost that made sense. How is it we can seriously be discussing putting a Man on Mars and yet wind and solar technology have made so few strides? Oil and coal continue to be consumed because Big Oil and Big Coal profit from it, not because us little people don't wish for better.

Nope. Obama should have regulated the industry. He chose not to. Un-fucking-lucky. He could have forced more stringent safety measures. He chose not to. Un-fucking-lucky.

Your boy king is partially responsible. Ha ha ha.

You don't help the Democratic cause by jumping to conclusions before the investigation has even started.

and I asked you how will piling on more regulation have prevented this spill....or are you too intellectually challenged to make a coherent argument in your own favor....I used your source to PROVE MY CONSENSUS that existing regulations are satisfactory according to the Dept. of the Interior....

Now debate your side or SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!!!
