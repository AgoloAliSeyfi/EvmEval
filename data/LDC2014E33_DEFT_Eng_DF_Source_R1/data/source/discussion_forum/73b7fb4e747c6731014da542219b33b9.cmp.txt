Since I don't pay any attention to Beck, I have no idea who he supports or why. Nor do I care. What I can tell you, hand on heart.... Hell will freeze over before I'd vote for Gingrich. Romney, I could grit my teeth, hold my nose, and vote for - purely for his economic experience. We need smart businessmen, not career politicians.

I'll vote for almost anyone over Obama. All of the Repugs would be an improvement over Barrack Obama.....including Ron Paul.

Btw, Newt hasn't been a politician for almost a couple of decades......so he's not a career politician anymore. However, when he was he's the only one I can remember that actually got things done. After all, he is responsible for balancing the budget and actually giving us a surplus.

When it comes to Romney, he's a businessman but he would have been a Senator if he could have beat Kennedy. Newt pointed that fact out the other day.

What we need is new ideas and someone who can't be bought. I don't give a shit whether they used to be a politician or not.

and there you have idiots pretending Im not right because they can not face the real truth.

You think your all clever because you can insult.

You were the ones who picked the worst president in history.

Your opinions are pretty meaningless to anyone who cares about real facts.

In what way did I insult you?

Yesterday Glenn Beck spent the entire program talking about how progressive Newt Gingrich was. The way he was talking about him it was like he was actually Barrack Obama. Beck almost sounded like he has lost his mind.

Glenn Beck supports Christian fundamentalists like Michelle Bachmann and Rick Santorum. He feels that Bachmann is his choice for President. Beck doesn't think that now is the time to compromise on our principles. Well, from what I can see, religion is the number one principle that Glenn Beck needs from his candidate.

If any of you don't know, Glenn Beck is a Mormon, or more accurately a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or LDS. I am currently an inactive member of this same church. I have some disagreements with the church. Some would say it is a cult. Harry Reid and Mitt Romney are two prominent members btw. From what I've seen it is a cult, a cult that Beck is a member of. He is a prime example of why Barrack Obama is currently our President. Folks that refused to accept anything other than their idea of a perfect candidate. Someone who has all of the right beliefs and says all of the right things.

I've talked to these types. The type of Christian that doesn't like anyone of other faiths. Christians that have forgotten the teachings of Christ or never learned them. Love thy brother as you would love yourself...regardless of his beliefs or his race.

Glenn Beck doesn't support Newt because he thinks his immigration policies are too progressive. He accuses Newt of being too progressive when it comes to health care. He's also another one of these nut cases that mistook what Newt said about Paul Ryan's plan claiming he actually wants GOP social-engineering, which is far from the truth. Newt merely said he would not exchange Democrat social-engineering for Republican social-engineering.

Glenn Beck has already made up his mind. He supports Bachmann, and he supports Santorum, but now he even says he'd rather vote for Ron Paul over Newt Gingrich. This is insane. Glenn Beck would rather lose another Presidential election then compromise on his crazy principles. After listening to him yesterday I got the impression that Beck is slowly losing his fricken mind. The way he was talking about Gingrich it sounded like he was describing one of the most evil politicians ever to walk the face of the Earth.

I believe Beck doesn't understand the way Newt thinks. He's totally misinterpreting his beliefs and thus doing a disservice to his candidacy and doing his best to usher in another 4 years of Barrack Obama. I don't think Beck really cares right now if this happens and that he may be one of the primary reasons it does. I'm not gonna voice my thoughts on what exactly is causing Glenn Beck to be so vocal about Newt or George W. Bush in the past. However I can say that it seems like he's doing more damage to his own professed cause than good.

We should care what Glenn Beck and Dick Cheney think at this point? The GOP seems to be grasping at straws these days not to mention the value they place on irrelevant commentary from both of them.

Your party has been found out.

Your bullshit of hating on half of the American people is getting your failed party no where.

That is why no decent republican candidate ( the very few there are) would run this go arround.
