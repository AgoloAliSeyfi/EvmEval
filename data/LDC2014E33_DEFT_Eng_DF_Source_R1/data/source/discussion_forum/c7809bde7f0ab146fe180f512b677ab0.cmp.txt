I hope you are right as my daughter hates her job and I would like to see her find another.

Companies have been holding cash for a while now and without demand, there is no need to hire. They are making a profit without new employees. Other bad signs for the economy are:

-the downward adjusted housing numbers
-paltry GDP numbers
-real unemployment rate

Good news though include:

-consumer confidence is up
-durable goods numbers up

What this great country needs now is the two sides to stop pushing agenda items and start making decisions that make economical sense.

Your daughter should start looking now. Tell her to get a good resume together and start submitting them online. Having a job is easier then not having one when looking. Employers like hiring people away from other firms. First..it's almost a seamless transition and second, if it's a rival then all the better.

And the "profits" they are making are accounting tricks. It doesn't last forever. And really, it's them that started the loss of demand. For two reasons. They wanted to cut high labor costs by hiring overseas and creating a glut of people looking for work. Initially layoffs had nothing to do with loss of demand. It was "synergy". Eventually..that's what started to happen, because UE got so high. But now..even the Chinese factories are in trouble because people are not buying their cheap crap.

Thus, people are starting to look for government solutions to the problem. And quite frankly, alot of things need to be done. Infrastructure, implementing new tech like cloud and IPv6, and high speed rail. However..that could tighten the high tech/engineer market again. Which would be bad for alot of these companies. Which is one reason I think a hiring boom will happen. What better time to snap up well trained peeps who've been out of work for awhile. And they get them on the cheap, while looking like "heroes".

In other words - Sallow is hoping for another mass bailout and enormous government spending. But no worries...Obama wants to cut 3 $trillion out of the deficit in 10 years (which will of course increase the deficit not decrease it)

These are just musings..but lately there's been alot of frenzied activity from recruiters. And I just went to the office party of my old job and while talking to some of the guys there, many people who were looking for a year or more are getting snapped up.

What's going on?

Well aside from the economy getting better, the Bush tax cuts are set to expire. And there's not much evidence they did anything to help. Employers are sitting on tons and tons of liquidity and playing "shell games" to keep making money..without adding to the overall economy. Given the present anger in the public at large, I have a feeling that to quell some of this..there will be a hiring boom.

Who knows... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

I don't think you'll see a "Hiring boom" till after the 2012 elections and that would depend greatly on the outcome.
