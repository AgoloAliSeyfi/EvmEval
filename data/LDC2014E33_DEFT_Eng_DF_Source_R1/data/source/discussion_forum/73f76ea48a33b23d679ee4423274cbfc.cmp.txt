The big problem with liberals is they are a bunch of upper-class/middle class tits pretending to be working class and pretending to have working class problems from the comfort of their countryside village who then, automatically dismiss any working class man who criticises immigration as a "fascist" and a "Nazi" and refuses to see a different between a true Nazi (like the nutters who support C18) and people merely opposed to mass-immigration.

It doesn't only extend to immigration. See the Dale Farm evictions, the travellers had a lot of support from middle-class twits who came down to support "the oppressed minority" and boost their own sense of self-worth without considering at all the thoughts and feelings of the locals who have had to put up with an illegal travellers site for over ten years and the crime and problems that it would bring. They only see one side of the argument because of their sheep mentality and lack the mental apptitude to see the bigger picture.

There's also a problem with liberals flat out refusing to report on anti-white racism. They're quick to cry out if any minority is on the recieving end of an attack, prejudice or violence yet make every excuse under the sun when a white Englishman/woman is the victim. Take the recent Leicester attack where Liberal groups were defending the four Somali women by saying it wasn't racist and that the lady who was attacked husband used 'unneccesary force' in protecting her.

If, they were less biased and actually opposed all types of racism rather than just racism by whites then honestly, groups like the EDL would not have grown as large as they did.

Personally, I am not opposed to immigration but it should be skilled workers only. No problem at all with having Indian lawyers, doctors, accountants etc coming to the country and improving it. What I do have a problem is giving a passport to any unqualified person with very few skills or qualifications when we have plenty of people who can do the grunt work anyway. Do we really need to allow a bunch of warehouse labourers and factory workers into the country when there's plenty of unemployed already who can do the job?

Yet, anybody who has an argument against mass-immigration is immediately shouted down by the left and the liberals as a "racist" and a "Nazi" who flat out refuse to listen to opposing arguments.

Another thing, the liberals and supposed "Anti-fascist" groups seem to verge onto fascist territory themselves at times. We live in a democracy, a place where freedom of speech exists and where people should not be targetted because of their race, cultural or political beliefs and yet, those on the left are constantly involved in attacks on supporters of right-wing groups.

Nick Griffin has been attacked and had a dart thrown at him. BNP members have been forced out of their jobs by "liberals" and anti-racist groups. Now, regardless of whether you agree with their policies and ideas, is it right that men should be attacked and forced out of work because of their beliefs?

Isn't attacks on political opponents and denying them the right to freedom of speech a traditionally fascist method? I don't support the BNP at all (I vote Conservative) but I do believe that Nick Griffin should be allowed to be a politician and give speeches without fear of reprisal. Likewise, I believe Anjem Choudary and his group should also be allowed to say what they want without fear of reprisal.

completely agree. until these issues are addressed in a grown up manner, rather than shouting "lol fascist", real racism and prejudice can only rise.

Britain is no soft touch and even if it were that would be no excuse for the bigotry of the EDL and other far right groups.

when an asylum seekers application is rejected they stay in the country anyway. it would be against their human rights to send them home.

Quite the contrary, we send people back to other countries all the time. Even to really dodgy regimes: <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/failed-asylumseekers-face-deportation-back-to-zimbabwe-2241862.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk...e-2241862.html</a>

Right, so all of those false asylum claimants riding the system on benefits and many of whom try again after losing their papers make Britain not a soft touch? The unaccountably huge number of millions perhaps of illegals who are just released onto the streets make Britain no soft touch?

Millions? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/>

I'd like some stats and figures please. It's all well and good shouting that the government lets in millions of illegals but without any proof, it's irrelevant. Fact is, if you want to immigrate here it is very tough.
