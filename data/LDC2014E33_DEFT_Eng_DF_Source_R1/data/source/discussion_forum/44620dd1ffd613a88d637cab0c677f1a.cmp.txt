i can see than hundreds of thousands of people having to breathe oil fumes is just a joke to you. You probably think most all human suffering is just some big joke - all of it, that is, except when it happens to you.

guess what dipshit - oil fumes are no laughing matter.

can someone point me to the finding that bp was found to be negligent in the drilling and opperating of the well and it was soley their actions that lead to this spill......

seems they have been found guilty without any credible proof of negligence....

I believe it is referred to as 'trial by television'. There is no actual, CREDIBLE report that confirms any one company is responsible.

But, we can't let that get in the way of moronic whining and hysterical ranting.

Sure, if you like to call something caused out of negligence an "accident" - whatever. I know I'm just a mere human, I have no right to question a corporation.

HOW DOES THAT CHANGE THE FACT I'M BREATHING OIL FUMES RIGHT NOW?

Nevermind the fact they are putting people out of business for years to come, I guess they shouldn't have to pay for that - those people can just go fuck themselves, right? "Hey Forest Gump, FUCK YOU!" is what BP should tell them?

Always the victim.

Oh, the drama.

Defiant1, if the deaths and destruction BP has caused dos not move you, you are less than human, or ill-informed.

So which is it? Are you sociopathic or just stupid?

What complete fuckwhitery. There is OIL in the GULF. Case closed, you knucklebrains.

ZERO tolerance for spillage means NONE AT ALL. The Strict Liability standard applies. There is OIL, ergo, BP is guilty.

Put down your twitter-vibes and stop obessing about Linsay Lohan's vagina shots. Try reading a fucking newspaper, you 'net parrots.

*Note to self: Call Mom and thank her for teaching me the ability to think for myself.*

BP's Oil, Transoceans platform, US Governments consent, the states bent over backwards to help BP, each and every American uses the products of the oil industry and refuse to cut their consumption.

Fuck you. We are all responsible, including those who are probably going to lose their livelihoods. Idiot.
