Gonna quote a user from another forum because he knows a lot more about it than I do.

How the Fed works and the nature of its structure is available on Wiki or the Fed's website. Have fun.

For legal purposes some of the aspects of the regional Fed banks are considered private and some government. Some day to day operations are considered private. Generally things that the Board of Governors do not dictate. The regional banks have some autonomy in local economic studies, how much to pay the janitor and so on. They are legally considered private. In national matters, especially in regards to monetary policy, they are considered government.

I didn't say you were stupid. I said just because you don't understand the Wiki or the Fed site it doesn't mean there's deliberate skullduggery afoot. I wasn't attempting to defend my point because I hadn't felt the need to do so, I merely suggested you do the hard yards for your own lazy self.

Sheesh.

The Fed is an independent quasi government agency. The Board of Directors and the Chairman are appointed by the President &amp; the houses. Member banks of the Federal Reserve system are mandated to purchase stock in the Fed, which they cannot trade and earn 6% on regardless of economic conditions. The bank is audited by the GAO, which is an arm of Congress. All Fed profits are remitted to Treasury each year (minus expenses). Last time I made a simple calculation the Fed's expenses made up 3% of its profit. The Fed has both public and private aspects but for the purpose of our discussion re monetary policy the Fed is an agency independent inside government. The role it plays is essentially the same as any other central bank.

The dividend is to compensate banks for meeting the reserve requirement, otherwise it would be tantamount to forcing banks to bury 10% of their money in their backyards.

So, with this awesome gold standard around...........how would any future depressions be dealt with?

Pretending they don't exist since Austrians can never be bothered to explain the existence of business cycles, recessions and depressions in the absence of central banking and fiat currencies.

Actually the FED bankers could have kept the country in the depression as long as they pleased simply by the power Congress gives them but they were not profiting from it. They just would not infuse any currency into the economy and hike up interest rates. It would stay in a depression virtually forever. The FED wanted the gold backing released so they could endlessly print money loaning it at 0% interest to themselves. This was what enabled the FED bankers to buy up all the farms in the US and billions in stocks during the 1930's. The small farmer virtually disappeared and they got all the farms for ten cents on the dollar using bogus unbacked fiat printed money. They also facilitated a massive transfer of wealth from the small businesses' to the large corporations by buying all the failing small business's.

As we sit here now the Federal Reserve is sitting in yet another depression they caused. They are content printing as much money as they please, loaning it to the banks they own for 0% interest and buying up all our homes, business's and stocks at 25 cents on the dollar. They could never do this with a backed dollar that actually had value. This can only be done when there is an absolute endless supply of money that is created out of thin air.

Unbacked money can also be endlessly lost with little actual debt value. If the central bankers lose a trillion they simply print another trillion and everyone holding a Federal Reserve Note loses instead of the actual investors or bankers. The FED bankers take every "dollar" or "FRN" they earn and immediately turn it into something else. They buy gold, silver, stocks, real estate, derivatives... anything but cash because they know it is essentially worthless.

Unbacked currency also allows the central bankers to endlessly print currency and shove it out the backdoor to whomever they please like they did the $16 trillion between 2009 and 2010. It allows for legalized counterfeiting. This "backdoor" unbacked currency printing allows for global government and stockmarket manipulation. Unbacked fiat currency in a central banking structure allows an unlimited supply of money that continuously erodes the value of the dollar itself. Every mortgage created devalues the US dollar and puts someone in debt. Every dollar is created out of debt in the first place which is insane with nothing backing it. Backing the currency controls most of this and stops the inevitable "controlled crash for profit" of unbacked currency.

After 30 years of saving an unbacked dollar in a centralized banking system your savings are worthless. Your savings are worth nothing to a bank or any financial institution for that matter. What they want is your "debt". The bottom line is unbacked currency stimulates spending and debt creation. A backed currency stimulates saving and investing.

The US dollar is backed by nothing but the printing press of the Federal Reserve. The US should have at least 3 legal currencies managed by different central banks going at the same time letting the market decide the value. This forces the central banks to stimulate the values in a competitive action rather than degrade them like the current currency monopoly. Have one backed and one not and let the market determine values.

I guarantee the people of the US would dump the Federal Reserve Note like chetahs at a salad bar.
