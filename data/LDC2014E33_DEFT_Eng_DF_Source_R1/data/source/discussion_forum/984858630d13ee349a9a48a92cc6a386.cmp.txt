I've been wondering this for a long time.
I, and I think most people, really don't know what the POINT is.
What is it Occupy expects the achieve?
What policies are they trying to institute?
What is the PLAN for change?

I've seen the generic rants and posters.
I know what the problem is. EVERYBODY knows what the problem is.
But what exactly are we going to do about it?

I've spent hours waiting at the station for my train, the leaders of Occupy Boston at the table across from me, hearing what they were talking about. There was never anything about a plan, just brainstorming ways to be more flamboyant.

Everybody sees what's going on in the country.
I'm just asking what Occupy's idea of how to FIX it is.

Unrest has been at a boiling point in this country for years. You showed up at an occupy movement waiting for someone to tell you what you're there for?

It's such an Amalgam of disenfranchised individuals that may not know what the end result to this may be, but know they're getting attention and voices are starting to be heard. I've been following this kinda stuff since protests for the Iraq war started and were right away ignored and ridiculed. You're suffering from the same apprehension and curiosity that much of America is experiencing right now about this.

I will say I'd rather reach other people through flamboyance than violence any day.

Well considering an organized protest and a political party are not the same thing, I don't really expect the occupy movement to come up with a perfect plan to fix everything. I am glad they are doing what they are doing as its spreading awareness and showing the government and corporate america that a lot of the citizens are fed up and would like to see some positive changes. I would be more active in the movement, but it seems nearly impossible to get involved with it in colorado.

I would like to see people who criticize the occupy protestors for not having a plan to fix the already falling system come up with an idea to improve things...but things are so screwed up its much easier said than done.

I could be wrong, it's been know to happen before, but I don't see the Occupy movement as the ones that come up with the fix for everything. It's more like they are the ones that point out everything that it broken, so everybody can see it.

That last bit is the important part, there are so many clueless bumps out there that think everything is fine as long as their GPS can get them to the theater to see the latest movie and then to Micky Dees afterwards for a dose of cholesterol. If EVERYBODY starts looking at the system for what it really is, and starts questioning things, then it can't continue the way it is without change, hopefully change for the better.
