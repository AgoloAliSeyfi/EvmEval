No they don't, but shouldn't they?

The father did all he could to prevent pregnancy. The condom splitting during sex isn't his fault. You said it was, which is absolutely laughable. Are you to suggest that he's to pull out after each thrust to check for a split? They noticed afterwards, and it was then out of the man's hands. He asked her to take a morning after pill, which again, is the most he could have done in the circumstances to prevent pregnancy.

Let's say the man wanted to keep the baby, but the woman took the morning after pill. The man's opinion was irrelevant, and the woman absolved all responsibility. Despite the fact that according to you this is &amp;quot;both of their fault's&amp;quot;, sole decision lies with the woman and she does not have to accept the consequences of something which according to you was partially her fault.

Now let's consider the opposite, the man wants rid of the baby, but the woman wants the baby (as is the case here, given that he told OP to take morning after pill). Surely, if we have equal rights, the man should be allowed to completely absolve responsibility, regardless of the wishes of the female. The man quite clearly cannot get an abortion as it's the woman's body, but why should he have to support a child financially against his wishes? Forcing the man to financially support the child is analogous to banning the woman from taking the morning after pill or having an abortion.

Chief Wiggum's post x 1000.

This thread should be a real wakeup call to guys. Even if it is a troll thread. This happens. You can be as careful as possible, but if the condom breaks and she's not taking the pill, she can decide to keep that baby, and you have absolutely zero say in the matter. That is completely BS. Yes both parties were responsibe, but ultimately, the power lies with the woman. Men have one form of birth control - condoms. Women have plenty more. And then the final say.

Unfortunately every day Children are born into the world by irresponsible, poor parents who can barely take care of themselves. Nobody thinks ahead. Who's going to pay for the baby? Who's going to buy food? Clothes? Before you know it the 'baby' will need school books, school costs, trips, he or she may want to take up a sport or play an instrument. I see far too many kids miss out on even some of the most basic things because of their moron unprepared parents. Parents greatly underestimate the costs. It adds up fast. Yes people find 'ways' to deal with it, but is that healthy for a child? Just scraping by? Living on the bare minumum wages, and or government support, family support and child support?

You can wave your moral flags all you like in regards to abortion, but the way I see it, willingly bringing a child into the world when you really know you're not prepared or financially secure is, in my mind completely wrong. Disgusting.

+1 to both of these posts, remind me to rep you both tomorrow as I've already run out of rep for today!

From a woman's point of view, I'd just like to add that it's sad that some women keep/abort babies regardless of the father's views. I know that my boyfriend and I have an agreement in place that I would seek an abortion if I ever fell pregnant, but I would still consult him first, as it's his decision as much as mine in my opinion.

Just wanted to add some female support to your posts <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

Just because a majority think it's ok to use, that doesn't make it less wrong

</quote>

Erm, yeah, it kinda does...

It used to be considered wrong for women to work, to have a role other than that of a housewife and mother. Then the majority changed their minds, and now it's not wrong.

I don't know whether it used to be considered wrong to use "retarded" in the way we use it now. But the majority now think it's fine. So I'll continue to object to your objection!
