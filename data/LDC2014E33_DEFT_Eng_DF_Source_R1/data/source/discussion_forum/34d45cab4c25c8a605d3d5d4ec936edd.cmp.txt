85 percent White British yes, but the outright majority are all of old age who will soon die. The sheer amount of mass immigration in recent years, coupled with a rapidly expanding decended immigrant population (very high birthrate, white British on the other hand extremely low birthrate)(quarter of all babies have a foreign parent, excluding 2nd/3rd generation immigrants) and white flight will, as many survey's and predictions have said, the white british will be a minority in 50 years..

Not forgetting! the 85 percent takes into account NI/Scotland and Wales. Taking the most populated area of the Kingdom,England, you will see the white british are far fewer in numbers, take into account urban populations, as the immigrant population is urban centred. As you know many parts of London are virtually all of foreign decent..

So what if it the 21st century? So called diversity preachers like you are only harming diversity. Mixing everything into one big melting pot isnt preserving the previous races/ethnicities is it?

Britain should be white, just as Japan should be Japanese and so on.. that is real diversity. Want to experience another culture? by all means visit it I certainly do.. doesnt mean we need every single one on our doorstep.

apart from limiting/halting immigration and preventing non-white, non-europeans coming to the UK, how can you protect the "white race" from being "ethnically cleansed" ?
People of different races will **** and produce babies and so that "purity of whiteness" is lost...

I don't see what people lke you want?

While people are suffering in the world, this country does give aid to countries that are suffering..what happens to it there is uncertain, soetimes the government take it to themselves.
Self sustainability is the key and the way i see it, Britain is not obligated to give millions to other countries when there are problems here that need sorting.
Yes while this is a safe haven at the moment it will not be in a few years time..rival countrymen coming here will fight and kil eachother creating miniature civil wars and destabilising the area.

Yes it's sad that some countries are in trouble but it is not our problem, in 50 years time this country will be white minority and the problems seen in those countries will be seen here, will turn from 1st world to 3rd world...a sorry end to a great nation.

Think 'Escape from New York' and you get the picture.

White people had virtually no genetic influence on the places they colonized. Now that they are gone you see no trace of them aside from the vast improvements in technology, infrastructure, health care etc. afforded to ex-colonies.

Prior to the colonial period or expansion into the Americas gene flow tended to be extremely slow, spread over thousands of years.

Nothing like transplanting the population from another continent half way across the world by the millions within the space of 10 years.

The point is, they had no right to colonise anyone. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/>

Okay, what about the the fact that Britain colonised a lot of countries in the past?

</quote>

This seems to come up a lot as well, as a matter fo fact countries were better off under British rule..bring British ideas and industry to places of no hope.

Zimbabwe used to be stable until the Brits left and Mugabe went mental and started killing and exiling the minority white people as some sort of 'get back' plan.

Zimbabwe since then is a right dump going no where.

Also i dont see thre being white majority groups in those countries, if anything they are getting smaller.
There was no mass immigration to India for example.
