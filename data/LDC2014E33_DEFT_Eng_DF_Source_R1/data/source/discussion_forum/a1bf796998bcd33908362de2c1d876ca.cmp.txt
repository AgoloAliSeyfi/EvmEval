High intelligence, ridiculous hours= rich?

This is not correct. Plain and simple. Being poor does not mean you are stupid. Many people take jobs that do not pay as well as other jobs they are qualified for for personal reasons.
Many poor people work ridiculous hours and are still poor.

High intelligence, ridiculous hours - rich? Yes! The majority of 'the rich' are what I would describe as upper-middle class (most rich people are not the super-rich, just like most poor people are not benefit scroungers). They usually make their money in jobs of responsibility - headmasters, business leaders, doctors, bankers etc. I don't care what those on the left say, these people are highly-skilled and work damn hard for their money.

The idea that people would emigrate to America to avoid taxation is one that I welcome, really, any money one earns is due to their residing in the UK (assuming they do so.)
If they wish to take their skills elsewhere, I have no problem with that, let them go to a country where essentially, poor people do not have the right to survive if they are injured.

Who do yuo think paid for all the "Labour investment" over the past 13 years? That's right, it's those evil rich people paying 40% of their massive salaries and 27% of bank profits into governmetn coffers. Just don't complain when there is no more money for schools, hospitals and roads when they do leave.

People like you who think that the state is "greedy" or is out to "take YOUR money" make me sick.
Had you been born in fricking Ethiopia, would you still have made that money?
Hell no.
Hence, you OWE the country you were born into for the simple fact that it provided you with the opportunity to succeed.
To think otherwise is quite silly really.

The UK government provides the same services to every one of its citizens. After all, isn't that one of the core values of the NHS? Treatment for anyone? In fact, if the Left is correct, rich people are less likely to use government services such as state education, healthcare etc. If you believe that rich people have got the most out of UK conditions in order to succeed in life and should pay more tax for it then surely you believe in a 'pay-as-you-use' system for healthcare, education etc. paying only for what you use. A very right-wing ideology.

Oh, and I assume you'll retort with something along the lines of "blah blah blah, communist, blah blah blah."
To which my retort will be: "I need to go to the hospital, my pancreas needs to be removed."

Sorry, I've just never bought into this 'the rich should pay a higher percentage of tax' ideology.

Awful idea. Should they tax expensive cars more? How about nicer houses too? Making 50-100k doesn't mean you're a billionaire as well, it just means that you need to sacrifice more to send your children to a better school.

I send my kid to private school because the local state school stinks. I'm not wealthy. I've been wearing the same ****ing clothes for the last 3 years, drive a company pickup truck, and I work 72 hours a week to make ends meet.

If anything I deserve a tax break, not a tax bill.
