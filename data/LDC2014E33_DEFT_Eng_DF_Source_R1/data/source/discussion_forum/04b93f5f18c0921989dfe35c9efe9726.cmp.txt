He worked with and enabled some of the greatest authoritarian economic witch doctors of all time, including FDR....In fact one of Friedman's greatest regrets is that he foisted income tax withholding upon the nation.

Unlike some, I don't consider Friedman to be an economic demi-god.

</quote>

Friedman was a lead in the Chicago boys economics. Think south America...Pinochet, anyone. In other words, yes, Friedman was for central planning in monetary policy. Keynes was too. He himself said his theories would work best under authoritarian style governments. Shocker, he was right.

What most all modern day economists have in common is they believe in the control/plan model of economics. There is a concensus that economics is a hard science, when it is not. In order to prove their a priori values correct in mathematics, they must eventually succumb to controlling it all.

Economics is a human action and can not be quantified in natural science. Monetarists have some things right, but fall right into the planning trap.

Friedman wasn't for central planning at all. He ideally wanted Free Banking. The point of monetarism was that given that central banks exist, which isn't to say that they should, they should be constrained by binding rules and have any discretion taken away from them. Strange to call that being "for central planning". But that's part and parcel of the whole libertarian/anarchist internet culture. Anybody that holds opinions based on contingencies that occur in reality rather than constantly pounding the same extreme views is a "statist".

Problem with Friedman is that he failed to recognize what Basiat did in "The Law"...That given the choice between work and plunder, most people would choose the latter...Which exposes the fatal conceit of monetarists: They actually believe that you can put imperfect humans in charge of the money supply without them rigging the game to benefit themselves and their friends.

You've taken Econ 101. I'm sure you're well versed in how shocks to monetary velocity that aren't offset, combined with nominal rigidities, can cause unnecessary recessions. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_eh.gif"/>

I sure you're well versed in the fact that you still can't push a rope.

False analogy.

It's the entire underlying premise of economic central control in general and Keynesian economics in particular.

Fluffing that flawed premise with a flurry of incomprehensible semantics can't change the fact.

And now we have a strawman. Is there any fallacy you won't invoke?

he advised Pinochet only about how to manage monetary policy. In fact, he gave him the same advice he gave our Presidents.

he said that? Then why be so afraid to prove it?

So I take it you're not at all familiar with Friedman or monetarism then. He wanted a k-percent rule so that a computer could control the money supply. The entire point was removing human discretion from monetary policy.

No strawman at all....I know bullshit semantics when I hear them...I'm well trained and versed in the practice.

Amongst the biggest bullshitters on the planet are neo-Keynesian economists and their kissing cousin Chicago monetarists.
