hey..

They intervvciewed Newts X right before a primary.

Did they interview any of Obamas former class mates?
Did they interview any of Obamas parishoners at Wrights church?
Did they interview anyne part of the Resko company?

Heck...I got a question....who did they interview to dig up any dirt that may be out there about Obama?

Who from his past did they intertview?

Hey,

They asked Obama about Bill Aires but never asked Bush about his relationship with the Bin Ladens...You know what that means...Yep, Media Bias.

We can do this all day but at the end of it all, it's just you laying out bullshit to claim you are the victim of the liberal media, liberal education, liberal historians, liberal scientists, liberal brainwashers, liberal washing machines that wont get that stain out etc.

It must be tough always being under attack...Thats when you let your conservadaddy hold you tight and tell you what a big bad world is out there and he'll protect you

you did not answer my question....

They interviewed Newts ex wife right before a primary.

They interviewed people that worked for companies once owned by Bain.

Who from Obamas past did they interview?

</quote>

Reverend Wright...any other assumptions?

Oh SHIT! Well, shit, why didnt you present that evidence earlier.

"Why didnt they say..." isnt proof of anything other than you thought up a question they didnt answer. Why didnt they ask Bush what happened to the millions that was lost in Iraq? Bias or they didnt ask?

Because I can think of questions they asked Obama and not Bush but what the fuck does that mean? Nothing.

Exactlyu...he admittted to using drugs. Do we know he did not have a bigger iussue? Who did they interview to find out?

He admitted to having some marxists semtiments while in college...who did they interview to discuss his "enthusiasm" or "lack of it" from back then?

But they interviewed an x wife who had already told her story to the press several years earlier...and then made that the first question of a debate.

Exactly GWB admitted to being a coke user...I'm sure youre all broken up about them not interviewing GWB drug dealer. Or does you curiosity lose steam when you see the (R)?

Yo...

he reacted to the question....and then he answered the question.

Yet the media that deemed it appropriate for the question to be asked did not feel the public warranted knowing his answer.

I willnot provide you a clip. I dont need to. You want to assume you are correct....go for it....live in your ignorance.

I love it.

Ah cute spin.....And lovely punt.....

You claimed he answered it, so it falls on you to provide proof. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

You won't, i win.

</quote>

ahh...

Perhaps....from debate standpoint...sure...I wont produce the evinidence...so you win.

Congratulations. You won a debate with an anonymous poster on the internet.

Yet you are please as punch that you have no idea that he answered the question.

An example of someone who prefers to be labelled a winner over knowing the truth.

See how that works?

Exactly...Reverend Wright.

Obama claimed to know nothing about his sentiments.

Then he claimed he did but paid no mind.

So one answer was a lie...so we know he, like all politicians, will lie for political expediency.....

So exactly who did they interview to find out the truth?

You seem content with the truth....you know...."I didnt know of them....oh yeah...he was my mentor...so yes...I knew of them....but I never really paid attention..."

And you were just fine with that.

And to you? The media did a great job.
