isn't it a little counter productive to "afflict bp" and "boycott bp"? Seems to me you would want them to make money in order to have money in order to clean up this mess.. Sheesh people..

I must say this is the most inane thread ever.

Boycott as you deem fit, but calling for the death of the CEO is over the top.

If it can be shown that the decison not to have the equipment that would have prevented this accident was inappropriate, then we really ought to forever ban that company from drilling in our territorial waters AND forever ban them from selling products into our market.

We cannot simply commit corporacide since that corporation is BRITISH petroleum, but we ought to punish it in whatever way is possible.

But ehn too, we ought to hang CONGRESS for allowing ANY company from putting our shores at risk like this.

So everybody will get off scot free EXCEPT the good people whose livlihoods will be effected by this spill.

They may or may not be compensated for their losses.

Sure, if you like to call something caused out of negligence an "accident" - whatever. I know I'm just a mere human, I have no right to question a corporation.

BP also from what I have seen pays their employees very well, and provides them with good benefits.

HOW DOES THAT CHANGE THE FACT I'M BREATHING OIL FUMES RIGHT NOW?

<quote>
I do think they should pay to clean up the oil spill, and fix whatever went wrong.

</quote>

Nevermind the fact they are putting people out of business for years to come, I guess they shouldn't have to pay for that - those people can just go fuck themselves, right? "Hey Forest Gump, FUCK YOU!" is what BP should tell them?

Always the victim.

i'm somewhat more interested in boycotting bp and forcing fund managers to divest all bp stock than i am in prosecuting the bp ceo, tony hayward, for murder and seeking the death penalty.

But 11 rig workers have already died.

<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/04/gulf-oil-rig-workers-fami_n_562239.html">gulf oil rig workers' families: Remembering the 11 who died</a>

as the oil pollutes the inland waterways, children will be poisoned and eventually they'll develop cancers, etc. And they too will have been killed by bp. The endangered species which will die off, such as manatees and sea turtles, might not be adequate to support a murder charge. But the befouling of the everglades and the final collapse of that system -- unique on plant earth -- will have a very abrupt and harmful effect on the earth and those effects will cause even more people to die.

Murder is not always face to face, yanno. I fail to see any distinction between killing with a bomb and killing with oil. A murder charge will lie if the actions of bp's ceo resulted in deaths and those results were foreseeable, and proximately caused by bp, -- and i say "yes", they were.

Hayward's as guilty of murder as the son of sam.

Here's a link to an interview he gave about the spill.

You are BP's mouthpiece? Air quality is a legitimate concern sparky. If one of your relatives had breathing issues or severe allergic reaction to the chemicals in the air..they have evry right to make a claim as do this poster.. If your response is "just move"... Relocation would be BPs responsibility.

I can see than hundreds of thousands of people having to breathe oil fumes is just a joke to you. You probably think most all human suffering is just some big joke - all of it, that is, except when it happens to you.

GUESS WHAT DIPSHIT - OIL FUMES ARE NO LAUGHING MATTER.
