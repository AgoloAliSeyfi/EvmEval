You know why SteffyWeffie...because Bush CHOSE to squander it.

He had the ENTIRE country behind him right after 9/11, the Right, the Left, and the Center. Howevr, Bush CHOSE to dismantle The Constitution and institute his OWN demented far RW and totalitarian policies.

There were no weapons of mass destruction. Iraq had NOTHING to do with 9/11. Neither did Saddam. He CHOSE to KEEP the country in a CONSTANT state of fear to blunt their thinking. He BULLIED the Press, for which I blame mostly the Press for for not pushing back. He ERODED our freedoms. All the things you guys CLAIM to be so pissed at Obama for...were INSTITUTED under Bush.

I didn't even mention tortured people.

Bush was and is an unmitigated. royal. disaster.

History WILL bare that out.

I've criticized him many times, for not wielding his veto pen nearly enough, for not fighting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan aggressively enough, and for spending money like a drunken Democrat.

Where's your criticism of SCOAMF?

If Bush started it how do you explain Clinton bombing Kosovo if Bush was the first president to ignore the constitution?

I was pretty pissed he didn't put up Public Option, he didn't fight hard enough for Health Care Reform. I think he gave and gives the Republicans too much leeway, in other words he doesn't fight then nearly enough. He agrees with them too much. He didn't shut down gitmo. However, I temper that with the realization that said Republicans are fighting him tooth and nail on everything.
