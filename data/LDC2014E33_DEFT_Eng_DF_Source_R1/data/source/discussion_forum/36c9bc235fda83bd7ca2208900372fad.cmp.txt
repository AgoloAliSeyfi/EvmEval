He got FOX to scrub any references to Saudi cash backing Al Qaeda. Heck..even Bush scrubbed the Saudis from the 9/11 commission report.

Saudis are the puppet masters of American conservatives.

No he didn't.

Making more shit up.

You should just give up expecting honesty or rational thought from swallow. He's lost the last remaining thread linking him to reality long ago.

Again Sandy..no swallow.

But here's a consolation prize. I hear soap might be good for cleaning the crabs out of a sandy vage.

Try it some time.

That Brit thing of going "au natural" really stinks. Maybe shave those pits too.

And, the influence that it shows happened is that the Saudi's request to change the description of a protest as a Muslim one to a civil one was only done after it was confirmed that it was not just Muslim.

Oh, the horror of such influence.

Which is pretty much the same as any other influential group trying to influence media... say, like the Color of Change organizing email campaigns to sponsors of right wing talk show hosts.

Influence... people have it, people use it. I see nothing of import in that. Of course, I'm not an hysterical lying race baiter.

Right. Rarely are retractions made without someone telling the organization that they are wrong.

Such influence! The horror! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

They must be state run, too.

NBC is owned by GE. GE is American. Thus NBC is state run. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

It's hard to follow such 'logic' as is being used by some in this thread. Mindless race baiting is beneath our intellectual levels, I suspect. That is our mutual cross to bear. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_angel.gif"/>

Lame.

Regardless of what you think about her person, your claim that FNC is state run is stupid. Seriously stupid, and not based in any reality.

It's the biggest, hottest news story in media.

Are they not a media company interesting in keeping the populate updated on the latest and greatest and hottest news?

Any of you wager to guess why such little coverage for the biggest, most powerful media organization on the world?

Much of its whining is stupid... it apparently can't tell the difference between 'media' and the 'flame zone'. One wonders how it manages to survive in the real world... but it does go some way to explaining it's lack of employment.

Only, I don't watch Fox.

And, I agree that Iran's nuclear program is a danger. I've thought so for many, many years now.

And, I would bet good money that if the US did strike Iran, you would blame Fox and so would Obama - he has yet to accept responsibility for anything.
