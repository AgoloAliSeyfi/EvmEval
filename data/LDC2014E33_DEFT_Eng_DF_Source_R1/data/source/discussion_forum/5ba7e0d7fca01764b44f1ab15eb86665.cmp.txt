his only message today was love of america, love of our veterans, and the sacrifice necessary to be charitable. nothing political was ever mentioned. you sir, are a piece of scum and should apologize if you have any dignity.

No sir I will not apologise for my statements. I did not see the whole rally. I did not see anything about the troops. What I saw was crap.

</quote>

i suppose you have to be a pile of crap to see crap. if you dont have any substance to your statements, why bother? You just look like a dumbass. If you are good at one thing, it's definitely looking like a dumbass. you obviously didn't watch it though as 90% of the content was honoring veterans for a charity that puts the children of killed military personnel through college. Of course, you have a problem with that message, right?

Dr. Glenn Beck? Oh PUUUUULLLEEEEZZZZ!!!!!!!!

Beck needs a doctor!(shrink)

His "faith" recipient just addressed Beck as "Dr." Beck. What a crock of steaming liquid shit!

Gotta change the chanel...these people are just too painfully ignorant.

You know how I know this event will succeed? Every left wing psycho on this board is attacking Beck, and not his message. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

So far, his "messages" have been replete with innuendoes at best and blatant accusations at worst that Liberals=ALL BAD; Conservatives=ALL SAVIORS. It's pure rot.

What?
Clearly you haven't watched any of it.

I've been watching the rallies and all the anti-beck rally people were WAY off base with their assumptions.

Its not even politicial. It actually is about some principles and celebrating those such as Faith, Honor, and Charity.

Some of you truly are just lost individuals who have nothing but hate and are so blinded by that hate that you can't see something when its right in front of you. All you see is "Evil Beck" and make yourselves out to be very petty individuals for attacking him when he is actually sending out a good message at this particular rally.

I pray that you can all get over your hate and celebrate the principles of equality, faith in each other and something greater than ourselves, hope that we can all come together across political lines in the name of charity, and love for our fellow citizens that this rally has been honoring for the last 45 min that i've watched it on facebook.

One can only imagine the screaming protests if Keith Olbermann had rallied the country in the name of honor.

Hilarious. I don't think Glennie would appreciate your comment. He seems to think she's One of You. Are you admitting she's just a token speaker? Do you think Glennie paid her?
