@Fido,

My point is that fear is a huge contributing factor to being overcome by viruses and other microorganisms and that is not spelt out by the medical establishment. To the contrary they are allowing the public to believe that fear is not something to be considered by not correcting the historical incidents and indeed adding to this picture themselves. People can live in filth and survive and be in better health than many people in their pristine environment. It is not simply a matter of what is in your physical environment. We have an immune system that protects us IF IT IS UP AND RUNNING! Fear that arises out of external conditions declines the immune system. And as you rightly pointed out there were problems in war time but they pale compared to the horrendous acts of cruelty that the Christian missionaries and colonizers did and that was why I raised the examples in Africa and Sth America. We don't need a great deal of time to develop immunity. It can happen almost over night but we need to be experiencing rest conditions and not fear conditions in the body.
As far as your arguments on costs and the capitalist system's failure I agree with you completely. People do not properly understand that there is no balance sheet. Companies have been allowed to pollute and otherwise exploit the environment and society without consideration at all. It can't go on like that and I think this is part of the global uprising. It is triggered by the debt problem because it touches people's lives in a very personal way but I think they will wake up to the big picture soon.

@Fido,

I agree here with you criticisms of the people who are driven by pure greed and who are mindless of the damage that they do. Your definition (Webster's) has a couple of magic little words in it.. "free market". If you put in the regulations that you say then you no longer have a free market. What is a free market? It means different things to different people. The greedy see it as meaning do whatever you like, which for them means take all you can and not only give nothing back but shit on the environment and the people all you like. We don't need capitalism. Democracy includes the ability to invest and carry on private businesses etc., BUT democracy means that everyone and everything is properly considered, that what we do must take into account a balance sheet. If we take from the environment to profit then we must put something back and leave it in as close to a pristine condition as we found it in the first place. To have a symbiotic relationship between employee and employers and so on. For democracy to work it must be founded on ethics whereas capitalism knows no ethic. I was in a bank some years ago to get a loan and the bank officer struck up a conversation with me and somehow the question of ethics arose. He kind of looked at me as if I was a simpleton and said something that expressed the notion that business and ethics were not bed partners. I asked him "you want me to pay off the loan without you having to take me to court to get your money out of me". "You're going to pay off the loan aren't you?" he said nervously. So I said to him see you do expect me to behave ethically towards you so why can't you see that ethics and business are partners and only when they are no longer partners does the system fail! He had nothing to say. Capitalism wants a double standard and that can't last.
