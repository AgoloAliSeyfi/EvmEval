Random men approaching you in the street asking you personal questions and stalking you?

Sometimes I could be walking in the street, minding my own ****ing business when a random bloke, usually foreign and black will ask me questions such as " Hello, whats your name? Where do you live? Do you have a boyfriend?" and sometimes just "Hi, how are you?" as if we know each other or something. Yesterday I was walking in the rain with my umbrella, wearing modest clothing (jeans, baseball jacket, Converses) when some random guy just starts talking to me like we know each other. <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/> The day before some chavvy looking bloke comes out of a store as I was walking past and nods his head at me like we know each other, and as I walked he kept turning around and then stopping in the middle of the street at some point. But the worst experience I've ever encountered was when I was 11, on my way to school one day when some guy asks me where a tube station is. So I say I dont know because I dont and walk away and he keeps following me and asks again. I say I dont know and then he proceeds to ask me personal questions. He asks me if I'm off to school and I say yes, then he asks me where I live, what my name is, etc. I tell him I dont speak to strangers but then I tell him I'm 11 in the hope that he'd back off but he didnt. He countined to follow me as I walked to the bus stop then said that he'd just like to know where x station is and that I "dont need to be afraid". I tell him that I told him repeatedly that I dont know where the bloody station is and he just kept following me. What made things worse was that it was difficult to get help from anyone in the street because they thought that he knew me. <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/>

I know some girls have experienced worser situations before, so I'd like to hear your experiences with this type of behaviour.

god that sounds horrible! some people are such weirdos. a foreign guy once came up to me and a friend in starbucks and started asking me if i was single/married etc and that he liked me, he was like 40/50 and i was about 16 so i was properly freaked out :| i decided to have a laugh with the situation though since i knew i was in the safe public cafe, so i put my arm round my female friend and told him we were an item. He looked repulsed and ran off, leaving me and my friend in tears with laughter.

the blokes that tend to do it normally are either drunks/druggies/likely pedophiles, sex deprived old men or foreign blokes that maybe aren't familiar with how english people tend to get socialise with strangers.

Walking to college once, I had on a pair of knee high socks and I wasn't wearing them in a slutty fashion at all - Then a wine-o said as I walked past him and his homeless buddies "Do you wear those socks to bed? heh heh" I felt like replying "Yeah I do because I actually have one"... Like hell I'd actually have the guts to say that though..

Once walking back from college a guy stopped me and asked for directions. I didn't think much because he looked around 25-27. Then he started saying "Do you want to do some promoting for me?"... Erm.. "No I have a job sorry" then he kept asking me questions about what my name was etc. I gave him a fake name, and he said he'd try adding me on Facebook after I kept on protesting that I'd add him on Facebook (yeah right)... Eventually he ended it with "Where do you work?" Me: "New Look", Him: "That's why you look so good" *pervy smile*... Power walk home..

When I was in New York last summer as I was walking past someone they said "Hey baby, I bet you taste good" I can't even say anything on it.

Me and my friend were walking back to her house once and a car pulled up beside us. There were two young chavvy guys and one asked to my friend "Do you go to 'random school'" and we just ignored them. They kept on revving up and pulling up beside us until my friend just said "No" to try and shut them up. Then they tried asking for her name etc, I was completely ****ting myself. One of the guys went to open their door, my heart stopped at this point and then they went "**** it, skets" and drove away.

I also really hate going buy building/construction sites or by white vans as (sorry to generalise) they tend to always have pervy men and the like there.

Has anyone ever thought of taking up self defense??

This is so true! What is it about builders and men in white vans. It's horrible when you realise you have to walk past one and even if you ignore them you can see them staring out of the corner of your eye.

This sort of happened to me once recently. It was quite late and I was walking home when this man came right up to me and started walking really close to me. I think he asked me if I wanted to go somewhere, and then I'm pretty sure he said something about my breasts, so I indicated that I'd like to be left alone. And then he responded with the immortal words:

"F*ck you then. Lesbian."

What a catch.
