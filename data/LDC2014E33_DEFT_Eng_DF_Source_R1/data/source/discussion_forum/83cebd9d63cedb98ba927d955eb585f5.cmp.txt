Here's a nutshell version of who qualifies.
For principle reduction:
1. Hold a mortgage from one of the big five banks involved (Ally/GMAC; BOA; Citigroup; JP Morgan; Wells Fargo);
2. Must be behind in your payments or in danger of "imminant default;"
3. In most cases your loan must be owned by the bank, rather than having been packaged into a security and resold ( IIOY note: I'm reading conflicting reports on this particular aspect );
4. Your loan cannot be covered by Fannie or Freddie.

To refinance:
1. Applies only to loans owned by the banks;
2. Borrowers must be current on payments and owe more than the home is worth;
3. Interest rates can be reduced to as low as 5.25%

If your house was already foreclosed upon:
1. Foreclosure must have taken place between 2008 and 2011;
2. You will receive cash in the amount of $1500 - $2000;
3. The settlement administrator will mail you notice if you qualify; borrowers who fear they may not be located should contact their state attorney general.

More basic info:
Settlement negotiators will pick an administrator within the next 30-60 days to handle the logistics.
If you qualify, you should get a letter from your mortgage company; the banks will also have a website and toll-free number that homeowners can contact. The government is urging homeowners to be proactive and contact the banks directly.

this sucks... I'm current and my rate is only slightly above 5.25. I really want one of those 4% rates.

They were saying on the news last night that it would probably take 2-3 years to hash out all the details. So don't worry homeowners in distress, token help to make a slight dent on your underwater balance is coming in a few years!

Given current interest rates, I was a bit surprised by the 5.25%. My guess is that this is a sop to the banks as well as security-holders, to the extent mortgages sold as securities are eligible, as well as a way to address the moral hazard issue.

I could very easily be in danger of "imminent default", like a mofo.....
