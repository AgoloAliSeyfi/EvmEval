Glad to hear that you do not fall into the media and obama hype of fear. If the crazy preac hers burns a few Muslim books so what If they get piss so what? If they kill so what? That was their plan all along. They do not need a reason to kill.

To put things into perspective, the Muslims flew some airplanes into a couple buildings and we got angry.

We, on the other hand, in the forms of the British up to 1945 and the US following that have redrawn the map of their region, knocked down and set up govenments, ruled, tried and condemned their citizens, imposed our culture and held up their beliefs as quaint, backward and provincial.

All things considered, if they did to us what we have done to them, there'd be more mushroom clouds than oil derecks in the Middle East.

Isreal is the right homeland of the Jew. The arabs were the killing mechine after hitler was removed. We have done nothing but put things back in its rightful place.

Richard the Lion Hearted would appreciate your world view. That view might benefit from a consideration of the Golden Rule. I've heard that the Tora (sp?) can be condensed to this one thought: Do not do to others what you would find hateful to yourself.

May or may not be right on this, but it seems pretty wise.

Would you find it hateful for a foreign power to roll into the USA, re-name all of the states, re-draw the borders according to nothing important to you, select and support a ruler not of your choosing and impose a culture dictating the dress codes, social conduct and education?

If your answer is "Yes", you may be on the verge of understanding the past hostility of the Middle East to the West.

The current situation is not the past, but the past is prologue.

That land is Israel's land but even if they were not there someone would be trying to exterminate them.
