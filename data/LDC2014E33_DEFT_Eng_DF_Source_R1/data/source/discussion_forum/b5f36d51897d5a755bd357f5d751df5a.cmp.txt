Excuse me, you pompous bitch? I was born here, just like you. you are no better than me, so don't act like it, it makes you look ridiculous.

Who do you think you are, that you can tell me to move? I'll fight you for it, if you weren't a girl. Just because you are a republican, doesn't make you god's gift to politics, although I know you and your fascist friends would like to think you are.

You don't deserve to live on this Earth, because you don't respect it, whatsoever. You exhibit no desire for balance, only the usual American excess, granted to you by your fake harbingers of 'freedom' such as Reagan, Cheney, and Bush. How deluded you lot are. So self-righteous, and so misplaced. It is a sad sight to see you quiver before an environmentally motivated action, and one I get great joy in seeing.

The earth comes first. Not us. We belong to the Earth, not the other way around. Was it your precious bible that taught you otherwise? I hope not. That is nothing but a fairy tale.

Listen you pompous ass...the earth has been around longer than you or I. and will still be here when you blowhards leave it. so go jump on your bicycle and come and get me to fight...I'll have to warn you though...I'd probably kick your ass <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

good argument!! I'm speechless. Let me get this straight: the earth has been around longer than us, so... we should destroy it as fast as we can while we are here, so that nobody else gets to enjoy it, and all for short-term economic gain? Maybe you repubs were all dropped on your head when you were babies, and you can't think more than two economics quarters into the future. You care for no one but yourselves, and the current generation, and of the current generation, only those with the same skin color and those in the same socio-economic class as you. Wow, talk about broadening your horizons! You really go the extra mile to be a decent person! Oh, but that's right... you believe in Jesus. So, your saved! What a crock of shit. You are very ignorant, and your ideology is ruining not only this country, but this world, and everyone and everything in it. You do not have a monopoly on truth, only it is apparent that this is your belief.

BTW... if you can kick my ass, that's hot.
