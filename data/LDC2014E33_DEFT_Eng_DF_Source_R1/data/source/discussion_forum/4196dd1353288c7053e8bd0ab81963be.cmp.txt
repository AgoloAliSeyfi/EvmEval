If the Republicans were to win the Presidency and both Houses this November, what could we expect?

1. War with Iran: Republican candidates are already beating the drums that we must use force to end the threat of a nuclear Iran. Diplomacy is for pussies

2. Further isolation of North Korea: Republicans did not respond well to Obamas food for demilitarization program. Expect it to end

3 Repeal of Obamacare: No replacement, just repeal. 30 million Americans without access to affordable care, people with preexisting conditions thrown out

4 Gutting of Medicare: Elderly Americans will be given a yearly allowance for health coverage. If it doesn't keep up with rising costs....too bad

5 Extension of Bush tax cuts, additional tax cuts for the one percent while the lowest fifty percent would see an increase

6 Reductions in Federal Student loans: Making it harder for working Americans to send their kids to school

7 Increased harassment of Mexican Americans: Show me your papers

8 Increased subsidies for oil production while killing green energy provisions

9 Creationism taught in schools. Evolution downgraded to an unproven theory

10. Global warming officially declared a hoax

11. Gay marriage repealed and DADT reinstated

1) I don't think anyone on whatever side WANTS war with Iran... but I don't think appeasing or using words will keep them from obtaining nukes and I could see bombing or supporting Israel bombing, if they keep on the path they are.. regardless of what party is in control...

2) Fuck NK and any country like them... isolate them more and more, no skin off my nose

3) Damn straight repeal Obamacare.... and work on true reform and further opening and deregulation of the healthcare/insurance system... more competition, more group access, brings down prices and increases choices

4) Gut Medicare?? No... streamline, cut costs, and keep those on it taken care of... look at ways of finding a differing solution for those in the workforce now so that Medicare is not their only option when they retire

5) $0.01 over NOTHING is OF COURSE an increase.... no citizen should have been paying a zero amount or even getting more out while paying nothing, in the first place... flat tax, no exemptions, no loopholes...

6) The fed has no business being a lender for student loans... you want a loan, seek it out, it is YOUR responsibility... The fed is not your bank nor your guarantee for funds for you as an adult going to college

7) Absolute RUBBISH... put proving you are a citizen (regardless of race) should be required for all voting, jobs, etc

8) Fuck subsidies... that is not a charge of the federal government... and while we're at it, cut out all government handouts

9) Where the fuck do you see this? Stating that evolution is but one theory and teaching the theory while not stomping on other theories that may or may not be based on intelligent design or whatever is not having creationism taught in schools and evolution thrown out... yet another typical scare tactic by you

10) Man-made global warming is a hoax

11) Get government out of marriage except in areas where government belongs, such as taxation, power of attorney, inheritance, etc... and I have already made my personal beliefs on open homosexuals in the military... but I do not see DADT re-instated

It might look like the America of old that had a backbone instead of the spineless libtard socialist view we have today.

That's what I thought too. I kept looking for something to disagree with and didn't find it.

This is where rightwinger posts his usual "none of you people can refute my claims" and announces his interweb victory.... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>
