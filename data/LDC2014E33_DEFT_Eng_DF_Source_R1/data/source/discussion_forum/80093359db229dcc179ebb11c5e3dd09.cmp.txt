@Cycloptichorn,

Love that graph.

As an aside, I can't believe two Minnesotans are on it. That Michelle Bachmann is just so UN-Minnesotan to me.

@Cycloptichorn,

It may well be that the response of Republican and independent voters was different in the 2008 Presidential election from what it was in the recent Congressional elections. Frankly, I don't know the statistics or any differences that might have been established. Whatever they may be, we will have to do significant analysis analyze them to separate the contributions of multiple factors; the presidential candidates themselves and issues most prominent in 2008 and the issues at the fore in 2010, being probably the most prominent. Then we would have to project them onto the still evolving contitions surrounding the next presidential elections - all things considered a fairly tall order.

With respect to your specific suggestion that (as I understand it) evangelical voters most aroused by the social issues of abortion and homosexual marriage may be less committed in an election focused more on economic and public spending issue - much depends on the degree to which they are aroused by the economic and public spending issues themselves and the degree to which they may find themselves reconciled to Democrats who take opposite views on both social and public spending issues. I am skeptical on both points. The dilemmas you posited with respect to homosexual Republican groups may be real, but I just don't think they will be of great import. I can't prove this any more than you can prove that they will be significant - we'll just have to wait and see. I do think you may tend to excessively characterize and prejudge evangelical voters a bit.

In a similar way I believe far left wing progressive Democrat voters will be sufficiently mobilized by the prospect of whomever the Republicans choose as their candidate to get over whatever concerns they may have about Obama's supposed "centrist sell-outs".

This is a fascinating thread, and as i said before, i don't consider myself well enough informed to comment. However, i do have a question for participants, and that is about conservative Democrats. Conservative Democrats changed the political landscape dramatically in 1980 by voting for Reagan, and in the Old South, many became Republicans. Even those who remained Democrats voted for him again in 1984, and although fewer than those who voted for Reagan, many voted for Pappy Bush in 1988. I consider Clinton to be a conservative Democrat, and that wing of the party was happy with him. The biggest differences between conservative Democrats and Republicans are on defense spending, social welfare programs and tax breaks for the upper income brackets. I don't think they're all that happy with Mr. Obama, but to get them to cross the line as they did for Reagan, i don't think a tea bagger candidate will answer.

What do you folks think about the prospects for the Republicans securing the vote of the conservative Democrats?

@Setanta,

I think Mike Huckabee would have a chance at it.

@Setanta,

Very interesting point, Setanta. It suggests the proposition that observable shifts in the political landscape here (large and small) may be associated with shifts in the choices of voters roughly in the middle of the political spectrum modivated by various subsets of the collection of issues that usually define political allegiances and the parties themselves. These shifts can as easily be associated with drift in the competing party platforms as with drift in public attitudes or concerns - both occur.

This isn't to negate point Soz raised earlier about the disruptive potential of disputes among Republicans over social issues, but rather raises the question, 'are they likely in current circumstances, to cause such drift ?'. I suspect the answer among conservative Republicans will be no, however the smaller number of homosexual rights advocates among them may be so affected. Just an opinion, I can't prove the point - we'll have to wait and see.

I believe Setanta's question about the potential of Republicans to capture votes among conservative Democrats can be answered in part by noting the much touted shifts in the allegiances of "independents" in the last election. The term "independents" is mostly the useage of pollsters involving their questions &amp; categorizations of voters in their repeated surveys - certainly more so than a fixed political alignment. I'm suggesting that, for the most part, these "independents" are in fact folks who have generally associated themselves with one party or the other, but who have identified themselves as centrist or susceptible to such drift in the polls themselves.

Using this interpretation, I think we can conclude that we have already seen a shift in the voting of conservative Democrats towards Republican candidates in the recent Congressional elections. Voter turnout issues in off year elections are likely a companion factor in the results of the last election, but the presence of a significant shift in voter attitudes appears undeniable to me.

Whether this will continue or be amplified in the 2012 election is something we will have to wait to observe. The prospect of continuing crises in the budgets and debt of state and local governments will certainly feed some of the growing concerns that (I believe) were behind the shifts in the last election (and the much touted "tea party" phenominon). The forthcoming debate about Federal budgets and the tradeoffs &amp; consequences of needed spending cuts in the Congress certainly has the potential to add to - or alter the direction of - this process.

For myself, I don't yet see any strong Republican Presidential contenders. I believe it is very likely the Republicans will at least capture a strong majority in the Senate in the next election and retain their strong majority in the House. Frankly, that's good enough for me.
