Yeah. You pretty much stunk up the place with that one, Dave.

You really take criticism of Dear Reader personally, don't you?

Another one that's been around the internet several times. C'mon Dave, if you've gotta be combative on message boards, at least be funny about it.

I must have missed the part in the TOS where I'm supposed to entertain people whose idea of humor is a Hitler mustache on a picture of Bush.

No, no, hell no. Democrats and other progressively oriented voters are CORRECT without question. That is an observable, measurable and well documented fact. Live with it or go find you a rightwing country where you might proliferate yourself a bit better. This country was founded on tolerance, diversity, charity, education, the betterment of a desperate but faithful and patriotic society and all other considerations now referred to as liberal-isms. We are certainly a far better country and society than what I see mostly posting around here condemning everything from the President to the smell of their own farts. You turnip green eating sonofabitches need to get some lessons on American history and foundational principles.

Interesting version of "tolerance": "Immediately and unquestioningly agree with everything I say or get out!!"

Please tell me you don't vote -- or breed.

Just reading about obama bringing dignity back to the office of president was enough to discredit the whole thing.

Bush let 'em go

You mad?

</quote>

You wrong.

The Bush DoJ had already won their civil case against the NBP. The Obama DoJ dropped the suit.

So you agree that if only 10% of what hacks like you say were true then our wonderful country would have folded in 1777? Or did I confuse you with someone with a different critical thinking skill set?

</quote>

No, moron. Unlike idiots like you, I don't subscribe to the positively retarded notion that those who disagree with chumps like you are "hacks." I read the drivel bullshit spew you posted. Ergo, it is clear that it is you who are the hack.

And no. The Country did well in terms of setting the foundation for what has lasted so far almost 240 years BECAUSE they subscribed to the things I believe and those whom morons like YOU consider "hacks" believe.

You wouldn't RECOGNIZE a critical thinking skill set, ya dickweed. You'd have to be able to think on your own. Clearly, you can't.

</quote>

My, my. This is a positive thread about the Prez as some here said never happens and bam, the idiots show up and try and make it about themselves and how they view their perceived terribleness of 'Murica. For shame, for shame. Like I said earlier, if only 10% of the horseshit you rightwing bitches said were true then our wonderful country would have folded like a cheap suit in or about 1777.

</quote>

Does that mean we are supposed to swallow rotten tripe just because someone is using it to say something nice about the President/ If I posted a thread talking about how wonderful it is that Bush got bin Laden would you let it go simply because it is positive, or would you call me for distorting facts?

Do you actually have a brain?

Not to mention, History is going to be VERY kind to Obama...unlike the last guy.

</quote>

lets see, Bush had 9/11 to deal with but yet it's the Obama who history is going to bestow sainthood on..

that what I'm talking about Obamabots and Jonestown..

</quote>

You know why SteffyWeffie...because Bush CHOSE to squander it.

He had the ENTIRE country behind him right after 9/11, the Right, the Left, and the Center. Howevr, Bush CHOSE to dismantle The Constitution and institute his OWN demented far RW and totalitarian policies.

There were no weapons of mass destruction. Iraq had NOTHING to do with 9/11. Neither did Saddam. He CHOSE to KEEP the country in a CONSTANT state of fear to blunt their thinking. He BULLIED the Press, for which I blame mostly the Press for for not pushing back. He ERODED our freedoms. All the things you guys CLAIM to be so pissed at Obama for...were INSTITUTED under Bush.

I didn't even mention tortured people.

Bush was and is an unmitigated. royal. disaster.

History WILL bare that out.

</quote>

holy smoke, you should sit here and preach about Bush dismantling the Constitution...DO you say that about the Dear Leader today? Everyone else thinks so but you 40% who still approve of him...so lets get real dear..
