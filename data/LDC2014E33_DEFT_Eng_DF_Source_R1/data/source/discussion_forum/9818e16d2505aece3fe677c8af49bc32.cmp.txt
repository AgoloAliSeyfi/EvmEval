The comments are hysterical. In response to the article, showing yet another 'skeptic' to be intellectually bankrupt, some idiot posts 'climate change is a hoax'.

And you base this on what exactly?

Who knows. Maybe someday one of these skeptics will get a real paper past peer-review.

Meanwhile, the GOP continues on its jihad against science:

Since 2010 Emanuel has written op-eds in the Boston Globe, The Wall Street Journal and The Miami Herald on the need for leaders to tackle climate change and on the link between hurricanes and climate change. Last year he defended the science of climate change in front of the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. He has vowed to continue his efforts despite being bombarded with hate mail after appearing in a video for the Climate Desk, a collaboration of media organizations. In it, he disclosed that he was a conservative scientist, and he questioned why GOP leaders are hesitant to deal with the climate issue when moral responsibility is such a big theme for the party....

Other scientists who once frequently contacted politicians, or were contacted by them, have decided it's a lost cause and have kept silent in recent years after being ignored by Washington or discouraged by policymakers' lack of interest.

The same goes for Calvin DeWitt, an environmental scientist who researches climate change at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. DeWitt is a vocal evangelical Christian and although he won't affiliate himself with a single party, he does admit his religious and cultural beliefs fall in line with the majority of Republicans. He has played a significant role in nearly every intersection of climate scientists with evangelicals and politicians, including the creation of the Evangelical Climate Initiative in 2006, a group of over 300 senior evangelical leaders who believe the nation needs to address global warming.

In recent years, however, DeWitt's efforts have been thwarted, he told InsideClimate News. "The times I've tried to reach out to politicians, I have not been welcome.

This statistic just dropped my jaw:

<quote>
April 2011 was the most active tornado month on record, with 753, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), compared to the previous record of 267 in April 1974. [...] On average, about 800 tornadoes are reported annually in the United States.
</quote>

Man-- nearly three times the number of tornadoes in a single month than had ever been previously recorded, and which came close to the annual average. Of course, it's only a single year's data, but check out the rest of the article for more support.

We've already seen one massive outbreak this year. Good luck with that lack of sirens, Brookfield.

Well hopefully all those people have insurance, so its all good, right?

<quote>
American Family Insurance Group in 2011 saw a nearly 40 percent loss in net income compared with the previous year, after customers pummeled by Midwestern wind and hail storms filed a record of nearly $1.2 billion in claims.

...
The damage started with storms that fueled $650 million in claims in April and May, including the tornado in Joplin, Mo., that killed more than 160 people and produced more than $100 million in claims.

AmFam is one of (if not the) biggest private employers in our area.

<quote>
Fearing that climate change could wipe out their entire Pacific archipelago, the leaders of Kiribati are considering an unusual backup plan: moving the populace to Fiji.
...
Kiribati, which straddles the equator near the international date line, has found itself at the leading edge of the debate on climate change because many of its atolls rise just a few feet above sea level.

[Kiribati President] Tong said some villages have already moved and there have been increasing instances of sea water contaminating the island's underground fresh water...

F. Sherwood Rowland, the Nobel prize-winning chemist who sounded the alarm on the thinning of the Earth's ozone layer and crusaded against the use of man-made chemicals that were harming earth's atmospheric blanket, has died. He was 84.
...

"Isn't it a responsibility of scientists, if you believe that you have found something that can affect the environment, isn't it your responsibility to do something about it, enough so that action actually takes place?" Rowland said at a White House climate change roundtable in 1997.

Rowland and his colleagues spoke out. A global agreement was reached, and the harsh regulations wiped the entire chemical industry. Or not:
