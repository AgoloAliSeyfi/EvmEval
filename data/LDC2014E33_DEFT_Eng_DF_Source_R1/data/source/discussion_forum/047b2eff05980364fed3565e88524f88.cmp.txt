2. All for naught...

Their deaths, and every other death, ISAF or Afghani, will be judged to be a waste. Ther is nothing, absolutely nothing, that anyone can do to change Afghanistan from what it is and what it will always be. A brutal, medieval, religio-crazy land of tribal/ethnic regions ruled by ruthless avaricious warlords that care only for power and their immediate families and minions. We can not leave soon enough.

6. It wasn't always like that. In late 60s - early 70s it was among the most progressive

countries in Islamic world with a broadly popular Communist party which led a socialist revolution there
in 1978. It wasn't until 1980s, when CIA and ISI unleashed the jihadist plague on the country and flooded
it with Saudi and Libyan terrorists to fight the Soviets, that it turned into the nightmarish hellhole that it
is now. Say thank you to vahhabite Saudi "benefactors" - those "friends of Afghanistan" who put three
generations of Afghani boys through militant jihadist indoctrination. Now the same "friends of Syria"
want to repeat the procedure there - with the same enthusiastic support from their American backers.
Don't people ever learn?

8. Guess who started the CIA activities?

Jimmy Carter, 'Operation Cyclone'. Carter signed an executive order on July 3, 1979 authorizing funding for CIA covert activities. He later said in December '79, "The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan is the greatest threat to peace since the Second World War". In a roundabout way he was prophetic as we have the mess we have 32+ years later.
