I've brought this up in other forums (Skeptic Magazine), and I'll bring it up here.

Anyone interested in the Jersey Devil, Bigfoot, Skunk Ape, Yeti, and so on should check out the books by Tom Brown Jr. ('The Tracker', 'Tom Brown's Field Guide to Wilderness Survival', 'Grandfather', 'The Quest', and so on).

This guy was, apparantly, trained in the arcane arts of psychological and guerilla warfare by an Apache scout named Stalking Wolf.

Many of the sightings of the Jersey Devil in the sixties can be blamed on him and his friend Rick--some Native Americans have a tradition of counting coup, which sometimes involves the theft of an intimate item and, basically, terrifying the living **** out of your enemy without killing him.

There are many secret societies that have existed in history. The Skull and Crossbones of Yale University has members like George Bush (Jr. and Sr.), the Black Dragon Tong of China, and the various ninja organizations of Fuedal Japan qualify.

I find it interesting that many sightings of strange creatures occur near tribal lands.

It wouldn't surprise me if there were some Native American traditions have survived.

All the best,

Good observation Kevin...

I wouldn't be surprised if an important part of those " Native American traditions... if they exist of course.. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>... didn't include keeping quiet ( at least beyond the inner circle ) about any such ' coup counting ' that took place...

Me? No. But a man I work with grew up in the Pacific Northwest, and says that, when he was young, he saw something which he couldn't identify, but which he can't think of anything else it could be but a bigfoot/sasquatch/whatever. He was climbing a tree when he smelled something "like a wet dog on fire." He looked around and there was something tall and furry facing him. He fell out of the tree and ran home. He says he knows it wasn't a bear, even though he couldn't see it clearly through the branches.

Just another anecdote.

It's also possible that a huge bear (with rear footprints larger than I've ever seen in Alaska, including Kodiak Island, and without any sign of clawmarks) was walking bipedally (there was no evidence whatsoever of a front pawprint).

It's also possible that a human walked those 20 miles up that particular, lonely trail, carrying bigfoot "sandals" in order to fool any hikers that might possibly happen by, and that we never saw that person before, during, or after the trackway find.

I suppose it's also possible that the trackway was left by a biological being other than a sasquatch (though I can't imagine what that might be), or an extraterrestrial being.

Or, the prints might have been left by a (no! no! don't write it! it cannont be!) sasquatch.

After considering the possiblilties, I've concluded that it was likely a sasquatch.

Its also possible that your statement does not report reality. Since we were not there, we cannot validate that...

From your perspective, that is true. I was writing from my perspective.

.....however, absence of corroborative evidence tends to suggest that BF does not exist / is a bloke in a suit.

In my case, yes. The absence of corroborative evidence suggests that my claim is unsubstantiated.

However, other sasquatch evidence does have corroborating evidence, and it is also rejected by some on this forum as not even being evidence.

The bottom line is that some folks are satisfied with the evidence available, some want more, and some will never be satisfied without proof.

Is this a Native American Conspiracy Theory?

Would such an accusation be racist, or would it just be stupid?
