Yes, I read that one.. very funny.

I like Jon Henley's Diary too.. all those highly curious odds and ends he gathers from the likes of the Lewisham and Catford News Shopper in 'comment' of current affairs... these nuggets just from the last three days:

<quote>
· In seeking to understand the dramatic, perhaps historic, events that have, over the past two days, so rudely shaken our great nation, it seems we have neglected the immense - perhaps crucial - role played by Farmers Weekly. "Autumn is just around the corner, and the peak season for TB will soon be upon us," warns the publication darkly on page 35 of its current issue, beneath a frankly insurrectionist headline, Time To Unite Against TB. "If we are to get on top of TB, as we must do, then the disease must be tackled. That means action on every front... We will never win the battle if we fight with one hand tied behind our backs." Innocent agricultural magazine or seditious propaganda sheet? Unhappy coincidence or treasonous call to arms? We report. You decide.

· Back in the dark and desperate days of 2003, when the Tories were at their lowest ebb and the tide was showing no signs of turning, this paper thoughtfully commissioned a hot young ad agency to come up with a campaign that might actually win votes. Their radical new post-political concept was to take any good experience and link it to the Conservatives, and any bad one and associate it with Labour. Thus, a sad-faced woman might appear with the words "My cat died under Labour", or a happy chap with "We won the Cup under the Conservatives". Simple but brilliant, the winning slogan was: "It rained less under a Conservative government". Yesterday Dave Fotherington-Cameron's newly resurgent Conservative party said it had retained the hot young agency in question, Karmarama, to help it design a series of "innovative campaign projects", including, quite possibly, its local election strategy. This, it appears to us, is beyond irony.

· Three cheers for Mr Tony and his fine government for choosing Trevor Phillips to lead our exciting new Commission for Equalities and Human Rights. It was, of course, a tough post to fill, since only three candidates - the heads of the Commission for Racial Equality, the Disability Rights Commission and the Equal Opportunities Commission - were ever really in with a shout, and the other two wouldn't touch it with a bargepole. So we fully understand Ruth Kelly's need to hire a leading firm of headhunters to find just the right person. And we are most grateful to her staff for getting this firm's fee down from an exorbitant 25-33% of annual salary to 20%, which even on Trev's humble existing per annum of £150k amounts to a mere £30,000 of all our money. Such astute stewardship of the public finances can, we feel, only bode well for the dear girl's next big job, the revaluation of our beloved council tax.

And on unrelated affairs, chiefly concerning squirrels:

<quote>
· It seems [..] that we may have been a trifle hasty in awarding our Local Newspaper Headline of the Week Award to the Orlando Sentinel for its admittedly outstanding Man Arrested After Pants Crotch Explodes. We have, it seems, a strong contender in the shape of Teenage Girl Buries Aunt Alive for Selling Dog to Barbecue Shop, from the Kurier newspaper in the north Russian region of Pskov. Regrettably, we disqualified Suicide Squirrel in Opera-Hating Kamikaze Bike Spoke Mangle - the worrying tale of Esa Ruuttunen, Finnish opera singer, who broke his nose just days before the world premiere in Helsinki of a major opera when a squirrel got tangled in his bike wheel - on the grounds that it came from theregister, which is a website. [..]

· Now is not, frankly, the time for a new terrorist threat, but we fear we may have uncovered one. Following our sensational series earlier this summer about squirrel sabotage in Beaver County and, indeed, this week's report about an unwarranted attack by a small bushy-tailed rodent on a Finnish opera singer, we are alerted by the indefatigable Gretchen Lippett to the fact that Google News is currently carrying no fewer than 1,670 squirrel-related stories. Sample headlines include Suicide Squirrels Strike Again; Killer Squirrel Takes On the World; Squirrel Threat Grows; Chased By An Angry Squirrel; Squirrel Defies Police Officer; and Vicious Squirrel Terrorises Town. Metro, the only paper to be taking all this remotely seriously, is already asking its readers What Should Be Done About the Squirrel Menace (a. Wipe out all squirrels, this is war; b. Try to understand their culture better; c. Bribe them with nuts), but the question, quite frankly, touches us all. Especially since, as the Chippewa Herald reports, squirrels at a cemetery in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, are even now "stealing American flags" from soldiers' graves to "rip them up and line their nests". And if that doesn't put the wind up you, we don't know what will.

For Osso and any others from elsewhere who might only just be getting their bearings on the whole Blair/Brown feud, there's as summary a description of the background as any here:

Thanks, Nimh. I'm now caught up in reading up to this post. Excellent thread here; it's filling in a lot of info/gaps for me.
