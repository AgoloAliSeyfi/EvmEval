Your puerile and always ineffective effort at ad hominem has never bolstered even one of your ridiculous arguments and in this case it constitutes just another massive fail by you in your long line of massive fails.

We called for unconditional surrender and we got it the day AFTER we dropped the SECOND of the two atomic bombs.

That we chose to be even moderately magnanimous doesn't change the equation at all. Not even a tiny little bit.

The Japanese were permitted to keep their titular head, the Emperor. We granted them that much. But the unconditional surrender we had demanded came only when they saw clearly that we could completely destroy them. (Ironically, the second atomic bomb was the last in our then very tiny "stockpile." But thankfully, the enemy was in no position to realize this.)

I have not embarrassed me, you stupid PussyPuddle. I embarrassed you, even if you remain too stupid and dishonest to recognize it or admit it.

Of course, as always, you embarrassed yourself, too. You always do.

Snitch Bitch. I just posted the fact Japan offered a conditional surrender and we accepted their conditional surrender which means it was not an unconditional surrender. Keep embarrassing yourself Snitch Bitch.

PussyPuddle:

You are not permitted to re-write history, pussy drippings.

We demanded AND GOT an unconditional surrender.

We elected (for reasons of our own) to allow Japan to keep it's titular head.

That's the fact, jackass. It doesn't convert the unconditional surrender into anything else. Sorry. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

End of story.

All your pathetic attempts to contort it or twist it and lie your absurd ass off about it will never change it.

I realize you are far too much of a gutless pussy to ever admit that you are wrong (well, in fairness, you did have to concede one time that you were wrong) but that doesn't change rality here: you remain wrong, MenstrualMess.

Now, of course, you being the abjectly and always dishonest lying cowardly pussy that you are will deny the plain words of the text, but the Instrument of Surrender signed by Japan ending WWII is really quite clear:

<quote>
We, acting by command of and on behalf of the Emperor of Japan, the Japanese Government and the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, hereby accept the provisions in the declaration issued by the heads of the Governments of the United States, China, and Great Britain 26 July 1945 at Potsdam, and subsequently to by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which four powers are hereafter referred to as the Allied Powers.

We hereby proclaim the unconditional surrender to the Allied Powers of the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters and of all Japanese Armed Forces and all Armed Forces under Japanese control wherever situated.

It was difficult for the Japanese to grant UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER to the Allies. It appears to be even harder for you to admit an historical fact. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

I've already posted the fact Japan offered a conditional surrender we accepted Snitch Bitch. When I said "keep embarrassing yourself" I didn't mean for you to make it your only mission in life.

Of course I can't "keep" doing that since I haven't ever started. That's just you lying again. Ho hum.

I have, however, completely exposed and humiliated you; but you are such a lying PussyPuddle that you are not even aware of how humiliated you should feel at this point.

Japan did not "offer" the surrender, either, you retarded asshole-licker. We offered it and they were obliged to accept it. You cannot get anything straight. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>
