1) Not in the Constitution. (It's the Declaration of Independence)

2) Has nothing to do with whether or not the states (the only entity that can regulate marriage) should be able to define who can and can't get married.

Which is why the marriage laws are different in all 50 states.

If you were to argue to me, that the laws should be changed because it's not unreasonable to let two consenting adults marry, even if they are of the same Gender, then, yes, that's not an imposition on anyone.

If you argue to me, marriage is whatever I want it to be because there's an imaginary "I want to" Clause in the 14th Amendment, I don't buy that shit at all.

the 14th Amendment has been in the constitution since 1870 or so. We are just noticing this now?

Well, Gov Christie says we get to vote to decide who gets to be equal

And unfortunately, unless the NJ Legistlature grows a pair of balls, that's probably what it's going to come down to. Or they can wait until he's tossed out on his can in 2013 and get a Governor who will sign the law.

No

Gov Christie made the call....he gets to live with it

He is now the George Wallace of Gay Rights......the only governor ever to veto gay marriage

Caving to your political base to make points sure did wonders for Wallaces hopes for the presidency

As I recall, Wallace was doing quite well for the nomination in 1972, until someone shot him.

Then the Democrats had a collective brain fart and nominated McGovern....

And yet another reason to get government out of marriage except for governmental matters of taxes, inheritance, and power of attorney for emergencies and medical decisions....

Again.. all a ploy for forced acceptance and government interference on one side.. and on the other side, not wanting to reduce government's scope

</quote>

so only religious people should be married, DD?

you want two tiers of relationships? one for religious folk and one for secular?

if you don't want government interference, i'm sure you'll agree that government should stay out of my uterus.

</quote>

Never said that Jill... since when did I ever state anything like only religious people should get married?

I think govt should stay out of your uterus... and also away from the life someone is trying to carve out of someone's uterus

Christie Vetoes Gay Marriage

Actually I think government belongs out of marriage. I agree that marriage is between a man and a woman but that can only be sanctified by God.

Render unto Ceasar what is Ceasar's. In this case I think that is beyond Ceasar's bounds.

I think you are correct, FactFinder.

I disagree. States must be involve in marriage if we are to have marriage licenses. Although marriages licenses have been used to prevent child marriages, bigamy, interracial marriages, same sex marriage, and transmission of disease, the primary purpose today is to legally document the marriage for tax purpose and many other legal actions. The lack of legal documentation of marriage, would cause a multitude of problems.

The founders were governed by social mores and never intended to insert religious mores into formal laws. All things governing religion were so important to the founders, they included freedom of religion in the first amendment.

I'm not buying the legal world prying at society's girders to foist an anything-goes society on American's heads. It's absolutely unwise because we came over here on boats from a corrupt European system based on all the assets in the government's hands crushing Christian believers. Our ancestors came here to escape that.

Why would we bring all that back, along with the big government it takes to crush dissent?

It's less wise to do such a thing than you think, imho.

Dick Cheney, the former U.S. vice president known for his hard right stance on almost all matters political, is taking a stand in Maryland for gay marriage. Cheney, whose daughter is openly gay, has been lobbying Maryland lawmakers as they debate whether or not to legalize same-sex marriage in the state. Cheney believes states should legalize gay marriage individually.

Cheney is for gay marriage?

Holy shit! Maybe the world IS going to end in 2012!!! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eek.gif"/>

Isn't it funny how Cheney does the right thing when it affects him personally?

<quote orig_author="Robert_Stephens">
Same sex marriage is illogical overall. Government should stay out of any discourse on same. It should be a state level issue and right, in whatever outcome may come.

There are three mitigating issues that brought down all the great civilizations of the past, without exception: They are:

untendable debt
expansionism through endless warring
tolerance of all things sexual.
