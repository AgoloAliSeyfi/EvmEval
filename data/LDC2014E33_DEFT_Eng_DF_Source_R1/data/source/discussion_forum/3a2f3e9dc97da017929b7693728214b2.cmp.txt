Facts?

"more people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in American history." - Newt Gingrich

More were added to food stamps under Bush than under Obama, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2012-01-18/fact-check-gingrich-obama-food-stamps/52645882/1">reports</a> Brooks Jackson: "Newt Gingrich claims that 'more people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in American history.' He's wrong. More were added under Bush than under Obama, according to the most recent figures...Gingrich would have been correct to say the number now on food aid is historically high. The number stood at 46,224,722 persons as of October, the most recent month on record. And it's also true that the number has risen sharply since Obama took office. But Gingrich goes too far to say Obama has put more on the rolls than other presidents. We asked the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition service for month-by-month figures going back to January 2001. And they show that under President George W. Bush the number of recipients rose by nearly 14.7 million. Nothing before comes close to that."

Of course, you wouldn't know a fact if it pushed your customer out of the way and bit you on the ass. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

Did you even read this?... what a spin.. it's Bush's fault for the recipients added during his admin, but somehow not so for Obama because he inherited a mess? Not to mention in a mere 3 years, Obama has added only a few hundred thousand less than under Bush's 8?

Priceless. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

By what criteria does anyone justify blaming a President for how many people were added to the food stamp rolls?

Specifically.

Reporting facts that Republicans may not like is liberal. Doing things that Republicans may not like is Presidential.

How dare the news report facts and...stuff! Liberals!

Diversion...and not accurately addressing the real issue we have.

Here is the issue..

Obama was reported this way...

Obama, showing America how he, too, is human, referred to the 57 satates today offering his overworked campaign staff reason to enjoy a much needed laugh.

Perry was reported this way...

Perry, again showed reason to question his knowledge of the three branches of government when he seemed to believe there are only 8 supreme court justices. His campaign staff is running around trying to put out the fires this has created for Perry's campaign.

Enough said.

</quote>

So you want the news to do an in depth fact finding mission to determine if Obama has been to 57 states and that would be fair since Newt said he never lobbied?

</quote>

Immature diversion from the point I was making.

Guess you just didnt have anything better to respond with.

You mean how to counter Newt hurt Feelings right? Everytime hes asked something he clutches his pearls and says "well, I never"

</quote>

um...newt played this up because SC is a very right leaning state who already thinks the media is far left. Newt basically jerked over all their faces and the people wanted more of it. You can see it in this thread as well.

In the end the story is this. Newt played it up to the base, they loved it, but he still dodged the question. You can't take one debate in a primary and use it for the rest of the race. If he were to win it would be a different ballgame, so his answer would have to be different.

Or

He could answer it the same and risk loosing the middle more moderate Indies and GOP...

Another one who decided to deabte something he knows nothing about.

Obviously, you didnt watch the debate.

He gets a standing O from an extreme wingnut crowd.

Why shouldn't they let it be general admission, where Democrats and Independents could sit in the audience?

</quote>

curious...

Do you see the audiences at a democratic debate as an audience of extreme wingnuts?

</quote>

Those would be 'moonbats'.

And no, I don't see an exclusively Liberal audience at Democratic debates. Definitely Lefties, though!

The media is biased in favor of a prolonged battle for the nomination because it's better for ratings. They will inevitably slant towards propping up the underdog and leaning on the favorite week by week day by day.
