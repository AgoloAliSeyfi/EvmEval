Bill Maher Saturday said America loves its military members the way disgraced football player Michael Vick loves dogs.

In his HBO special "Bill Maher...But I'm Not Wrong," the outspoken comedian went on a vulgarity-laden two-minute rant against Republicans and the troops.

BILL MAHER: For the longest time, every Republican election has been based on some sentimental bulls**t: the flag, or the flagpin, or the Pledge, or the, "It's morning in America." Bill Clinton got a blowjob in the Oval Office. And the Dixie Chicks insulted President Bush on foreign soil. And when that happens, it hurts the feelings of our troops. And then Tinkerbell's light goes out and she dies. Yes, yes, the love of our troops, the ultimate in fake patriotism. Are you kidding? The troops, we pay them like s**t, we f**k them and trick them on deployment, we nickel and dime them on medical care when they get home, not to mention the stupid wars that we send them to. Yeah, we love the troops the way Michael Vick loves dogs. You know how I would feel supported if I was a troop overseas? If the people back home were clamoring to get me out of this pointless errands. That's how I would feel supported. But, you know, don't hold your breath on that one fellas because, you know, when America invades a country, we love you long time. Seriously, we never, we leave like Irish relatives: not at all.

Honestly, is this REALLY what HBO wants broadcast on its network?

Bill Maher may be feeling inadequate these days so he's cutting loose with another lefty rant to get his name in print. It's how he makes his living.

Having no acting skills and very little talent Maher is becoming passe' and he doesn't like it.

Saying he stuck his foot in his mouth, implies that he feels sorry or embarrassed about what he said. I highly doubt he is either.

And you obviously don't watch HBO very much!
