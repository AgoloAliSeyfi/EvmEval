KABUL, Afghanistan - Two American military officers were killed inside the heavily-barricaded Interior Ministry in the center of Afghanistan's capital Saturday, CBS News reports.

Mandy Clark, reporting from Kabul, reports the government offices are under lockdown after a U.S. colonel and major were shot dead in the ministry.

The shooting occurred as protesters threw rocks at police, government buildings and a U.N. office in eastern Afghanistan, kicking off a fifth day of riots sparked by the burning of Korans at a U.S. base, officials said.
