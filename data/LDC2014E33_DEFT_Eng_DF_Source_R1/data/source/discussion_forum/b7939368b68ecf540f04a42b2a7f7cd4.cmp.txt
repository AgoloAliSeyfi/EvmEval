the GOP has an agenda. They wholeheartedly disagree with the idea that Goveernment can dictate via law what an enterpsie can and can not sell. If the product or service is legal, they should be allowed to sell it. If they choose NOT to sell it, that should be THEIR choice.

That is the crux oif the debate. It happens to be contraception right now...but all along the agenda is the same.....government has no right to tell ANYONE that they HAVE to SELL anything.

i think the crux of the debate is people understanding that contraception (as provided by health care providers) will not "free." it will be included in the cost of your original premium. thus they can not charge an extra co pay or fee for. there are other services this applies to as well, such as mammograms. now... should all men who pay premiums demand that women pay for their own mammograms since 99% of men do not get them?

the way health (and really all) insurance works is that you pay a premium for access to services. when you pay your premium and do not receive any services, you area subsidizing someone else's services. so every month i pay premiums, i help to pay for some guys viagra, or some womans pap smear, or some kids physical. should i be raising hell that they should be paying for those services themselves? but your insurance contract will not allow for that. call your insurance company and demand that none of your premium dollars be used for any services or treatment you disagree with and see what happens.

Take a pill so you can fuck your brains out is not the same thing as getting a mammogram to see if you have cancer.

Don't be fucking retarded.

The crux of the debate is that the State went into a Church and directed them to do something against their faith.

You get all hot and bothered when that same State invades your bedroom. It is very revealing of your two-facedness you don't mind it invading a Church.

although you can take that same pill to control acne and hormone levels as well. not all women use the pill as a pregnancy prevention device.

It's real simple: Get the hell out of everybody's bedroom and start worrying about the economy. This contraception thing is nothing but a new shiny object to distract the easily distracted and unfocused Republicans.

All you say is true....but you need to remember...it is insurance...so whereas someone else uses viagara, and you dont, you have the policy just in case ytou DO need viagara.

It is like flood insurance. I have it, but never used it. My premium is paying for the poor guy that had to make a claim. I am OK with that.

If I werent, I have the right to call another insurance company and try to get a better rate.

But again...the real topic is the mandate..."ALL INSURANCE COMPANIES MUST OFFER THE SERVICE"...

It is government intrusion into an iundustry. I understand why government says you cant sell somethiong for it has been found to be dangerous...

But to FORCE SOMEONE TO SELL SOMETHING?

It is not OK in my book.

And by the way...my wife and I enjoy sex....but we are done with having kids...so yes, we use contracption...in many varieties......I am not against contraception...I am against government mandating one must offer it....even if it goes against their personal morals.
