Dems: when you find that you've dug yourself into a hole, stop digging.

Bush &amp; Co.: ditch the shovels, let's start blasting.

I think the war effort is digging a foxhole to secure America while the dems are just abjectly digging in the gutter.

Go hide in your bunker, then, and let those of us who are still free face the world.
</quote>

I ain't hidin' anywhere. If you think I am going to just sit back an let the dems screw up our country you have another thing comin'...

'Cause when the military comes home if they come home in victory I will be with them cheering them on and if they come home in shame I will be behind them while they pin the blame on the democraps.

You will just imagine the rage when the military are sent back into a much worse environment in six mos to a year after being yanked from their duty prematurely by none other than the dems. Oh yea, and a few repugs will have their comeuppance for being on the losing side.

We know who you are...

Anyone putting politics before protecting the homeland will have a price to pay.

that's an awful lot of tough talk there sweetie so tell me if you will exactly what it is you're going to do action wise against these democraps and non war supporters and people like me for example who think people like you for example are full of shit.

Are you going to kill me?
are you going to send me to an internment camp?
Are you going to come around and beat the shit out of me?
are you going to take away all my resources, savings and property and leave me and my family to starve?

Oh wait, because you're a christian are you going to pray for me and change my heart through good works and agape love?

Or maybe, and I suspect this is most likely, you'll just yap away like a little terrier behind the screen door on various web forums.

My you are the initimidating one. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"/>

I guess with the cowardly dems calling the shots we have not much choice but to watch Islamo-fascism sweep through our free country by the sword and behead all you sorry liberals. I along with other Christians will bow to Allah (who is the same God I worship anyway) and watch the fireworks. You will get what you deserve for not standing up for the freedoms that people of faith have ALREADY sacrificed their lives for.

There will be no tree hugging on that day I assure you. Us repugs were just trying to save your stupid idiotic liberal asses. We on the conservative right already love God/Allah... We just have not thought it right (as Christians) to force people into faith. But since you have no spine WHATSOEVER to stand up for your right to hate God you deserve what you have coming.
</quote>

So answer my question... what are YOU.... the brave slogan chanting, tough talking God fearing superior republican christian going to do to rid your country of the threat of repugnant godless tree hugging liberal democrat spineless scum like me and those like me.

Not a goddam thing that's what. So shut up why not? <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"/>

I'm sorry to say dearie, that you are just not that threatening or scary.....

You don't get it. You have no concept of the enemy You think this war is a big game of jacks.

I will not have to lift a finger. The time for that will have long passed. There are plenty of Al Qaeda types who will take it upon themselves to do the dirty deeds even against the will of Allah.

I wouldn't even say anything if i did not care...

so you are courageous enough only to stand behind some sort of ideal, or worse yet, merely stand behind the ideas and actions of others yelling like Scott Farkus' toady.

You are an inspiration to us all.

Too bad you don't know how to stand up for freedom against Islamo-fascism... You pretend to know everything else.

When our Republic lies in tatters, the made up word "Islamo-fascism" will mean nothing.
