BANGKOK, June 27 (Reuters) - Thousands of "red shirt" supporters of ousted Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra rallied in Bangkok on Saturday in their biggest protest since sparking violent clashes two months ago.

The United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), better known as the "red shirts", gathered in the capital to demand that Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva dissolves parliament and calls an election.

Six hundred police were on duty and hundreds more on standby at Sanam Luang, a public square near Bangkok's Grand Palace.

The exiled Thaksin, who was blamed for instigating riots by "red shirt" demonstrators in April, addressed the crowd by telephone and accused Abhisit's government of mismanaging the economy, raising taxes and plunging the poor into debt.

He pledged his loyalty to his supporters and called for all Thais to put aside their differences.

About 20,000 protesters braved the pouring rain to listen to the hour-long address by the former telecoms tycoon, who was ousted in a 2006 coup and fled Thailand last year to avoid a two-year jail sentence for graft....

Thailand is going to hold another high level meeting. With the nasty experience not too long ago when another summit has to be cancelled due to protests, the Thai authority this time is taking full precautions, and the US is bringing security guards to protect Clinton.

BANGKOK, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming 42th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM), Post Ministerial Conferences (PMC) and 16th ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in Phuket will not be disrupted by any street rally, Thailand's Supreme Commander Songkitti Jaggabatara said on Tuesday.

From July 17 to 23, Thailand will host the three meetings in the southern province of Phuket.....

The Thai government has implemented the Internal Security Act (ISA) from July 10 to 24 covering the whole Phuket Island and up to five kilometers offshore surroundings.

The ISA law enforcement will direct people that any public gathering is not allowed at Phuket's international airport, traffic areas between the airport and hotels, and areas surrounding the hotels.

In a related development, about 10,000 soldiers will be involved in providing security at the ASEAN meetings in Phuket, the website quoted a military source as saying......

However, the United States will bring its own security guards to protect U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who will attend the ARF.

26 July [BangkokPost] Deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra's big surprise on his 60th birthday on Sunday was a video clip of him singing "Chan Ja Klab Ma" (I Will Return).

The red-shirt supporters of the fugitive politician, including his brother-in-law and former premier Somchai Wongsawat, took part in a merit-making ceremony at Kaew Fah temple in Nonthaburi.

Thaksin made a brief phone-in address from Dubai to his supporters. He thanked them for making merit for him on his birthday, and hoped he would return to work for his supporters in the country again.

27 July [BangkokPost] Insurgents add to their arsenal of weapons

Militants in the South are believed to be receiving training in bomb-making from the notorious Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist group active in Indonesia, a security source says.

The source said a key member of JI believed to be linked to the July 17 bombings of the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta was providing the southern militants with the bomb-making training.

He also said radios, rather than mobile phones, were being used to detonate bombs - a method devised to avoid detection by authorities' efforts to track phone signals.

Southern insurgents have embraced transceiver technology in their bomb attacks, a technique found to be common in the Iraq war.

Radio transceivers are known to have triggered recent bombings in the far South. They make for a more efficient trigger device than mobile phones because authorities cannot interfere with the signals....
