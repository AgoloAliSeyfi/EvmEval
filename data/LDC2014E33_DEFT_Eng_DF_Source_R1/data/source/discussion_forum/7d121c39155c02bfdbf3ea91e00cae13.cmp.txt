What does a liberal do when anyone brings up Bill Clinton.

BRING BACK THE "NUTS AND SLUTS" DEFENSE!

Thank you for making my argument.

The old male chauvenist double standard.

Bill Hordog Clinton was a hero for getting booty.

Anyone woman who caused him a problem was a slut!

Exactly what I said.

Thanks for backing me up!

EXCUSE ME AGAIN!

But while everyone is donning sackclothe and ashes over some supposed slurs thrown toward Amy and Chelsea (for which I have yet to see a scintilla of evidence.)

Does anyone remember how Juanita Broaderick was treated? Lewinsky? Paula Jones?

It was like I was back in high school.

The SAME SEXIST DOUBLE STANDARD that feminists supposedly were fighting against WAS ENSHRINED IN PUBLIC POLICY AND THEY TOOK IT DOWN IT EVEN ATTACKING FIVE YEAR OLDS!

Bill Clinton was some "victim" of his hormones. "I mean he couldn't help himself. After all he's a guy!" Poor wittle Bill Clinton.

And the women were "nuts and sluts!"

The guy is a hero and a victim, the girl is a gutter slut!

And the same feminists who were going after sexual harrassment after the Anita Hill debacle failed to take down Clarence Thomas, took their rage on the road and started attacking five years olds with "sexual harrassment."

But the same people who went after five year olds for "kissing a girls buttons," suddenly turned a blind eye when it came to Old Billy Boy!

Bubba was a victim and feminists went so far as to write they would get on their hands and knees and give Bubba a Lewinsky as long as he kept abortion legal.

ANYONE REMEMBER THAT? I SURE AS HELL DO!

And anyone want to remember how the BUSH TWINS WERE TREATED.

Comedy Central was even doing "That's my Bush" with the Bush Twins as incestuous lesbians.

And you libs claim oppression over Chelsea and Amy?

HAR DE HAR HAR!

What selective memories you all have!

Notice how liberals won't address the different treatment the women against Clinton got?

Thank goodness for the internet then, since the news is there for you.

<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/11/23/us-israel-nazis-idUSTRE4AM1Q420081123">(Reuters) - An Israeli court jailed eight Jewish teenagers on Sunday for carrying out neo-Nazi attacks in a case that sparked revulsion in a state that was a haven for Jews after the Holocaust.
Tel Aviv District Court Judge Zvi Gurfinkel sentenced the teenagers, aged 16 to 19, to between one and seven years in prison for a "shocking and horrifying" year-long spree of attacks that targeted foreign workers, ultra-Orthodox Jews and homeless men.</a>

Who's an idiot?

Oh yeah, women that make themselves completely dependent on men.

Yeah, you!

This is what you get for trusting A new organization that is known to have Islamofascists infiltraters in it. You don't remember the Reuters fauxtography scandal?

Your "Jewish" Neo-nazis weren't Jewish! Surprise!

Congratulations! You just got your ass kicked by this "stay at home" woman.

None of those sites refute my original story. The original story describes specific crimes committed against foreign workers, ultra-Orthodox Jews and homeless men.

Further reading. Note the non-correlation with your links.

So far, I'm not really feeling that ass kicking. And as a liberal and a feminist, I support your decision to be a stay at home woman. And if your husband should die or empty out your accounts and take off with a floozy, I would still support your decision by supporting programs that would allow you to stay at home with your children instead of placing them in daycare and working to support them financially.

Yet I don't think you support those same programs, which is what makes conservatism anti-woman.

Dumbass, these "Jews" were people who immigrated to Israel and caused problems for them. They were not "Jews."

Try reading comprehension.

Man, this is a damn stupid thread.

The media made fun of Sarah Palin because she's stupid. Not because she's Conservative.

There are many, many conservative women that have in fact been given all kinds of undeserved praise by the right-wing specifically because they are conservative.

Many people hate these women, but not any more or less than many people hate women on the liberal side of the fence.

Women like Nancy Pelosi, or Hillary Clinton, or Rachel Maddow.

In fact, I have seen extremely hateful comments about all these women on these very pages. In fact, I'd be willing to wager that with a little searching, I could find comments such as these made by the OP.

As I suspected, you have no proof otherwise, because there is no proof, only accusations.

Bill Clinton Cheated on his wife.

You dont cheat on your wife if you respect women, yourself, or your marriage.

</quote>

That depends on whether they agree to outside affairs, so once again, you have no proof and loving dozens of women does not mean you don't respect every one of them.

Ever get anything of substance, do tell.
