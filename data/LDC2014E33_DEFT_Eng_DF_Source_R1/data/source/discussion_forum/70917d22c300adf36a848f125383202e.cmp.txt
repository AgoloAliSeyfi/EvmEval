And how many is that and show me your proof that people just won't move to another area.

BTW if they don't move, whose fault is that?

Damned peanuts in the US last year, damned wheat in Australia last year, and damned grains in Russia in 2010 should have all walked to somewhere they could have grown properly.

Really dumb statements, Skull.

So if the earth warms areas that are too cold to grow crops will not become more fertile?

The entire earth will become a scorched wasteland huh?

OK Chicken Little.

When will it be too late to do anything about global warming?

Have we already guaranteed our doom?

So you are a warmist too ehh? Sorry to hear.

The facts....

from about 1980 to 1998 we had a 1/3 of a degree warming period. This started the Man made global warming claim.

Another inconvenient fact for the man made global warming crowd. Since 1998 until today there has been no significant warming.

A further fact. In the early 1900's scientists predicted that over the next 100 years the temperature would go up globally about 1 degree. And that is what it did.

So we had an 18 year trend that saw a rise of 1/3 of a degree world wide. Followed to date by a 14 year period with no appreciable warming. Remind me again how we are all doomed?

According to the dataset of the UK Met Office Hadley Centre (see figure), 1998 was the warmest year by far since records began, but since 2003 there has been slight cooling.

But according to the dataset of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (see figure), 2005 was the warmest since records began, with 1998 and 2007 tied in second place.

Tracking the heat
Why the difference? The main reason is that there are no permanent weather stations in the Arctic Ocean, the place on Earth that has been warming fastest. The Hadley record simply excludes this area, whereas the NASA version assumes its surface temperature is the same as that of the nearest land-based stations.

Where the monitoring station positions are cuts both ways..........there are significant temperature differences just 40-50 miles either way. The k00ks never want people to know about that. Anybody who cant recognize that temperature station data readings are the definitive example of cherry picking = hopelessly duped.

I just realised I never actually answered the OP. Amelia, it will be too late when the asteroid impacts somewhere on the planet and wipes out civilization. Too late because we COULD have done something about that.

On the other hand, other than cooling the planet (relatively easy to do) warming it up is far, far, far beyond our ability.

The point is, regardless of when it was, the ecosystem was completely different. What caused the 'global warming' then? If the Earth is warming, which it currently is not, there is nothing we have done to cause it, nor is there anything we can do to stop it. You think trading carbon credits and enriching a small subset of people in the process is going to 'save' the planet? Give me a break. And I'm thought a fool for believing in God. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

What caused warming in the past is irrelevant and the blanket statement that we can't be causing it is false. We know the properties of CO2 and know that it's about 100 ppm above historical averages, since the advent of the Industrial Revolution with no other explanation for its rise. Given those facts, who's kidding who? It's time for the skeptics to prove something, not just sit back and deny or ignore facts that pile up on a daily basis. You're quick to jump on the factoid that "the earth isn't warming up right now", but even saying that shows the shallowness of the skeptic argument. Any other time we'd be hearing about "natural cycles", but when given evidence of just such a cycle blunting a warming trend, we hear crickets chirp! Top that off with "carbon credits" and that just shows that the argument from the skeptic side is political in nature and they've given up on the science, preferring mere lip service about what happened in the past and natural cycles, but nothing about what's been happening for the last ~200 years! You can't take the past as a template for the future, if underlying conditions have changed. That's basic science AND logic.

Not to mention placing them in urban heat sinks. Gathering temperature data from an airport tarmac yields a vastly different result than from a park or a forest. In Corona CA, they moved the recording device from the airport to the city hall - less than a half mile away, and average temperatures dropped 7Â° - a huge amount. Former Mayor, Jeff Miller was elected to congress, and was able to effect the change.

Anthony Watts did an in-depth study on this particular bit of fraud. It is startling.
