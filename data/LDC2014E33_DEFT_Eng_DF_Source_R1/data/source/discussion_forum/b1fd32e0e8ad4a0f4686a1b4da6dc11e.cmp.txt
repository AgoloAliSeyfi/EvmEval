Why was Trayvons body laying 12 hours in the Morgue? Why didn't his father report him missing before he did? Where was Trayvons Father when Trayvon needed him the most less than 1000 feet away.

These are all questions that the Sanford PD will have to answer and account for. There's no excuse why they bungled this up so horribly. I know of only one reason how this could have happened.

how is this relevant? Don't blame the father.

Fuck you and fuck marc race baiting son of a bitch. Where the fuck was the father who sons less than 1000 feet away was dying? Why did it take the father so long to report his son was missing?
After all his son had been suspended for 10 days from school. Marc seems to this there should be more news reporting about Trayvon don't bitch about it when someone ask these questions because the longer this goes with media attention the more Trayvon will not look like an angel but a child who did not have any parental guidance

Not only are you coming apart at the seams and falling off the deep end, but you're showing how openly racist you are.

Again, good luck with that blaming-the-father-of-the-murdered-victim path that you're on. Carry on.

His father may have called friends, etc. I have not read his father waited 12 hours to call the police in any case.

Trayvon's father doesn't deserve any blame at all. Why didn't Trayvon call his father and say "get out here and take this yahoo off my ass" instead of calling his girlfriend.

Who knows? thats a good question but the boy is dead now.

W know, because for those who have followed the story, the father was out to dinner with his fiance.

When they arrived, they used the front entrance, and wouldn't have even seen any aftermath hours later (if there were any) in the common backyard.

He very likely just assumed his child was in bed, sleeping.

The very next morning was when he called in a missing persons report.

Thank you, Paper

For those who need to see how the layout was, and where Trayvon's fiance's house was in relation to the shooting, here:

Trayvon being in the morgue for 12 hours is not the fault of Sanford PD. Trayvon did not have an ID. So why didn't the father call the PD and report his son was missing? Did he allow Trayvon to stay out as long as Trayvon wanted too?

Why is CNN grinding away at Zimmerman? They are clearly pushing an agenda.

Why is the Zimmerman defense team grinding away at the deceased victim, Trayvon Martin, unleashing a smear campaign the likes that have never before been seen this century?

</quote>

More media attention, and more media, period. More TV channels, internet, mobile phones, etc. etc.
