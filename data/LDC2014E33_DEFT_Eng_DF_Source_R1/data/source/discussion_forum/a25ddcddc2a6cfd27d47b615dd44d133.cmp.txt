We live on the minimum, and at the moment with car payments and shizz, there is barely and money left over for much else other then the basics. Up until a few months ago, my plan was to leave school at 16, get a full time job, and get some more cash in for the family, even though i actually like school.

Anyways, long story short, I then found out about EMA, which will make my life a whole lot easier. I can get a part time job and still study and then go onto university, so yes i agree with gettng cold hard cash, because not all of us will be spending it on booze, I know i will be spending it wisely, and book tokens and bus passes would not help me at all, I would need petrol money instead of bus fair etc, which youneed money for rather then tokens.

I think EMA is mis-managed in some cases though. Il give you a for instance. I know someone who is a "bad lad" as in has commited numerous crimes and is under the age of 18. He recieves £60 per week, ontop of weekly bonusses for actually just BEING there. Its ridiculous. Ooh also, i know someone who gets £30 because she lives with her mum who doesnt work, but her dad earns 90K a year, even though she gets £500 a month from her father. Now that is ridicuous, especially when i have a friend in the opposite situation, she lives with her mother and father, who have good paying jobs, but she has a huge huge family, and they dont even get pocket money, yet she gets no EMA. So the system is a bit hayward, and needs some management.
Oh and then theres the girl who does 2 hours per week, and gets £30! thats insane!

If i was PM, id make a bank/debit type account for each person who in my eyes was entitled to EMA, however you wouldnt be allowed to take any money from it, you would only be able to buy things from the card if you get what i mean, have it a certain bright colour, and make it synonomous with EMA too so that people in off licenses will see that its an EMA card, and deny them the right to buy alcohol. Simple solution in my eyes, and would make life so much easier. Oh, and if the school suspect they are using their EMA for the wrong things, the school/college should be able to check online or something to see what has been bought. Its just an idea though. <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.png"/> Wow this turned out to be quite the rant.

Wow, seems like you're really proactive and focused on your family, honestly lots of respect for that.

But don't you think that it would be better putting into place a finance and help system for young carers (there might be help in your area, I'm not sure) rather than a blanket EMA?

As for getting a job, i've been looking for part-time work for a long time now, it's not that easy.
It's easy for anyone who's financially secure to criticise EMA, but i'm not financially secure and EMA makes my life significantly better.

Here here!

Theres nothing worse then "better off" folk saying things similar to: "it will be easy for you, youl get £30 a week" When most of the time, they get regular pocket money, and have been since child hood, along with a contract phone, money to go out with friends, piano lessons, private maths tutors, wheras people such as myself have not had any of these priveleges.

I too know your pain where part time work is concerned, i printed off 94 cv's in school and handed all of them out EVERYWHERE. I havent heard anything from anyone, (well i had a phone call asking me if i could do monday-friday from 3-6:30, and i dont finish school will 3:30 so that wouldnt work). I have no experience though where working is concerned though so that may be why, but I have to start somewhere!

I do not currently recieve EMA, but will do next school year, and i cannot wait. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/eek3.gif" alt=":eek3:"/>
