What Titanic herself couldn't traverse, bleedin' David Beckham manages to do. Won't he please go away?

P.S. Not meant personally against any forum member... unless Beckham is secretly one

The MLS is quote: "pretty much equivalent to the top half leauge one". Now, as I watch Tranmere too, I would say that's a little harsh considering some of the rubbish I've seen served up down there over the last couple of years! <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/> However, from what I've seen and heard, the problem isn't so much that the better sides can't play, but that there isn't enough quality across the MLS to give it any sort of 'blanket' 'standard'. I've spoken to fans of many of the sides there (who also follow English sides) and they groan in frustration at the lack of ability, in particular in the middle of the park. There are some good, local defenders, and a spattering of good forwards, but the creative players are missing. Mind you some would say that there are too few creative players in the game period these days............... <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

I cannot see the MLS expanding it's current support base. Why? Because there is simply no room for it amongst the better established national games, because the game in it's current form isn't suitable for mass US consumption, and because while the US produces superb young 'soccer' players, the wages, and the glory (important in the US psyche) are in the NFL and the MLB and they all go in that direction at high school.

On the European leauges, I agree the standard is higher than anywhere else, but that is a very new situation. Traditionally, the leauges you mentioned in South America were very strong and the Copa Libertadores was pretty much on a par with the European cup. Now, football on that continent is in a bad way, with corruption, leeching of it's stars across the Atlantic at ludicrous levels, and gates at an all time low. Sadly, the European leauges seemingly bottomless money pit has damaged everyone else enjoyment. Unless of course they want to watch our leauges............... <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

On that standard itself though, I find myself wondering where football is going? The money drag is towards the biggest only now, and the standard in Europe itself has become a gulf between top and even the next tier. Where once everyone was on a pretty much level playing field, with even quite modest clubs able to win the European cup, now it's the same tired old faces, and the 'smaller' sides get beaten out of sight. Yes, that's always happened, but it tended to be at the expense of Luxemburg, the Maltese champions etc, not major footballing sides like Roma, Sparta, etc.

As JohnG agrees, it's also highly debatable as to how good the national leauges are. The PL, outside (and possibly including one of the big four) is pretty much full of average teams, to downright poor at the bottom end. Poor, as in I would expect to see them in the mid Div.2 (old) in days of yore, not the top flight.

The irony is, is that there is more money in the European game than ever, and that should mean better football? But, because it's not evenly distributed, the same faces get all the 'top' players, and, as that trend is increasing not decreasing, the leauges, and not just ours, are seeing a worryingly small number of teams benefiting, and as result dominating their respective national leauges. The football itself is also, quite frankly, terrible. I ditched (in disgust) Sky a few years back as the ratio of good to poor games I was watching was about 1:4, now (thanks to my being able to endure the PL's rank and file again through Setanta) it's about 1:8. Those are statistics that should worry those in charge of the game.

But it doesn't.

Why would it, when after a quite shockingly poor season, the pundits were all telling us how 'fantastic' it was. <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/>

You know Overkill we are coming together on views here. I agree with your comments on MLS, perhaps League One is a better comparison to MLS, save the few 'Designated players' they have, which are a higher level. Common view tho is that MLS does now have a stable and growing future. Clubs are now building their own stadia, which is something the NASL never managed to do, and huge ( and I do mean huge) soccer facilities, such as playing fields are built along with these new stadia. It may never be the NFL over there but after a few dodgy years in the early 00's it does have a stable and positive future. On the boards there is now a lot of talk about how MLS may eventually take over as the 4th sport from the troubled NHL, (U.S TV ratings for soccer have dwarfed even the ratings for the Stanley cup this year) however time of course will telll, good luck to them I say, there are a lot of genuine football fans in America, they deserve a stable pro league which they can follow locally.
