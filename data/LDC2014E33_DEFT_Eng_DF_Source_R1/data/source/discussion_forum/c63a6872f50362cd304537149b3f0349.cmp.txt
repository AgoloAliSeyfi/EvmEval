You don't go after banks corporations too much in a bad recession. I haven't seen any plausible ways suggested to get them to stop hoarding.
Any public option would have lost us blue dogs and the whole ACA. COULDN'T get anymore.

I believe he could have seized the major banks and nationalized them. Then forced them to lend the money given them by Bush, and also force them to rewrite loans. That certainly would have helped get the country going again and was being called for by some of the more far left liberals.

I didn't mean to suggest a Public Option would have made it all the way through, but Obama dropped it quicker than he dropped smoking. That never made sense to me.

What makes you think that a US President has the right to seize banks and nationalize them? The reason that the US has always attracted foreign investment is that we are a nation of laws in which the owners of private companies are protected from arbitrary "seizures" of their assets by the government. Do you not grasp that this is what makes us different than so many other places in the world?

As for "forcing" banks to make loans? Have you so quickly forgotten that doing THAT was what got us into trouble with the housing bubble that just burst? It used to be that banks looked for 20% down on a house and one had to PROVE credit worthiness. That all changed when government intervened in the process and forced banks to make loans to people that didn't qualify under previous standards. "Forcing" banks into making bad loans was bad policy before and it remains so now.

That's the really frightening part! That they think that way. They are nothing but a bunch of communists trying to "fundamentally change America"

My biggest disappointment is that he seems to think he is above politics. He thinks he can stay out of the infighting and come in at the last minute and resolve everything. He has an idealistic view that if he is reasonable, the other side will be reasonable too. The result is that he is the only person in the room compromising

The result was an unfocused Stimulus bill trying to please everyone. He gave up the Government Option on healthcare. He extended the Bush tax cuts and offered spending cuts without corresponding revenue increases

On the bright side, it seems he has learned his lesson and realizes the other side is not playing by the same rules

You mean like Obamacare? Give some examples of this. It just shows how looney left you are. Obama is the most divisive bitterly partisan President in my lifetime, and that's up against some pretty stiff competition.

Really? How old are you? I'd have to say Nixon was the most divisive one I've ever lived through. Do you have some examples of how bitterly divisive Obama has been?

</quote>

I agree. Either Kaz thinks George W. Bush is a centrist, or Kaz is a child.

I wonder which it is.

Yeah, that's how we got Obamacare rammed down our throats. That's not what's rammed down your throat though, is it rw?
