The INC forced it's creation because they would not negotiate any sort of settlement to appease the fears of the Muslims.

Both sides had equal parts, but this absurd claim that because the INC did not want the partition meant they had no hand in it is absurd.

No such thing, as settlements were there, and again the quote clearly shows who started the ethnic cleansing, check the detail in the attached link,
Pure facism the 2 nation theory, nothing democratic about.
INC did not want the partition-basic fact, they surrendered to the violence going on:

Why had the fearful Great Migration come to pass? Why were millions of people wrenched from their ancestral homes and driven toward an unknown, often unwanted "Promised Land"? For years Hindus and Muslims had struggled side by side for independence from British rule. With freedom finally on the horizon why should India begin to tear herself in two along religious lines?

The overt act that split India began in the streets of Calcutta. But the decision was made in Bombay. It was a one-man decision, and the man who made it was cool, calculating, unreligious. This determination to establish a separate Islamic state came not -- one might have expected -- from some Muslim divine in archaic robes and flowing beard, but from a thoroughly Westernized, English-educated attorney-at-law with a clean-shaven face and razor-sharp mind. Mahomed Ali Jinnah, leader of the Muslim League and the architect of Pakistan, had for many years worked at the side of Nehru and Gandhi for a free, united India, until in the evening of his life he broke with his past to achieve a separate Pakistan.

The British Government did little in Calcutta to stop the Muslim violence against Hindus that began on August 16. After a week of communal conflict some 5,000 people were dead with more than 15,000 injured, and about 100,000 were homeless. Chief Minister Suhrawardy and the Muslim League cabinet were blamed for declaring Direction Action Day a public holiday and not stopping the violence. Viceroy Wavell visited Calcutta and then met with Gandhi and Nehru. Wavell wanted to postpone the Constituent Assembly, but the Home Government insisted the Interim Government be inaugurated on September 2. The Muslim League urged people to protest by calling that day a Black Day, and hundreds died in the communal violence that broke out in Bombay and Ahmadabad. Gandhi learned in October that 5,000 people had been killed and 50,000 injured in Noakhali. The 77-year-old peacemaker went on a “village-a-day pilgrimage,” walking 116 miles in seven weeks.

Jinnah suggested a compromise that was accepted, and on October 13 the Muslim League agreed to join the Interim Government. League members took office on October 26, but Jinnah still held back. Pethick-Lawrence invited the leaders to meet in London in December. Jinnah gained some assurances and stayed on to give speeches warning the English that if they did not grant Pakistan, there would be civil war in India. Muslims refused to attend the Constituent Assembly on December 9.

democratic or not, when one party has more votes than the other:

Meanwhile, Lord Wavell's efforts to set up a short-term coalition/interim government at the centre had also broken down. mohammed ali jinnah wanted a ratio of five Congress Hindus, five League Muslims, one Sikh, and one scheduled caste representation in the proposed government. The Congress rejected it.

Proportional representation could easily have happened

end of the day what done is done, no going back really, Pakistan and India have to come to better and friendly relationship, and even after some time a sort of European Union type area, wheere the common people of that area can have better welfare.
Good luck to people of Pakistan
