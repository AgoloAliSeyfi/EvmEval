My phrase "gang of the resentful" generally refers to a middle class which feels its former abundance of influence and power slipping away. It's understandable that the offspring of generations of people who got a better deal would feel bitterness that they are now "more equal" and indeed may have to watch as advantages they once had are given to others -- to redress injustices. But we have no right to pat ourselves on the back because we offer so much "equality of opportunity" when that is still blatant bullshit.

I was a volunteer in an extracurricular program at an inner-city school not so long ago for kids K-6. Much of it depended on family participation and, since many low-income AF-Am and Mexican-American kids had parents whose jobs were not M-F 9-5, and who could not come to the special activities on evenings and weekends because of their often multiple jobs, their participation was minimal or nil. Those kids lost out.

There is an inherent belief that it's not a big problem if some schools are much better (quality and funding) than others. Our school system is based on 19th century white middle-class values. It tries (and fails) to cram newer Americans and descendents of slaves and other cultures into that mold. Mould. Both. Forget about color. We are now a country which has on the one hand increasing and embarrassing distance between rich and poor and on the other is a country in which a minority culture (older and indeed whiter) prevails. Doesn't make sense to me. Does it make sense to you? Either we make insufficient, late, apologetic gestures (like affirmative action) or we get our butts in gear and make this country into the place we keep saying it is.
