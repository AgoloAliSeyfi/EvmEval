People demanding the harshest possible sentences answer me this: would you rather spend 10 years in prison, or suffer the pain and humiliation of being raped? I know what my answer would be; you can't put a price on your freedom - look at the Syrians. Can't believe some people are trying to pass off lengthy prison sentences as a slap on the wrist.

Make the criminals do manual labour building the prisons - start in Summer, if they don't want to die of hypothermia come Winter then best get building.

I'm far from an advocate of the rights of prisoners, far as I'm concerned they SHOULD be working, sitting around and eating free food is far from repaying your debt to society.

That being said, wasn't what you just described part of Schindler's List?

First the (incomplete?) Definition of rape can be found here <a href="http://cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sexual_offences_rape/">cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sexual_offences_rape/</a>. Yes both men &amp; women can commit rape.
1 every 10 minutes = 6/hr= 144/day =~ 52,560/yr. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/jul/14/crime-statistics-england-wales#data">Guardian link</a> (sourced <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/crime-research/hosb1011/hosb1011-pfatabs?view=Binary">from Home Office</a> ) shows breakdown of "Total sexual offences" 54,982 for 2010/11. Could they be using the 53K numbers for their OWN cause? Data shows rape of a female as 14,624 (9509+2880+2235), rape of a male is 1,310 (392+247+671) worth 8.2% of all rapes. "Rape of a male child under 16" =247, if Justin Bieber was British &amp; reported Mariah Yeater, he could have been in this stat! Why is she admitting to rape?$ <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":wink:"/> $

Notice the BBC article "11,766 allegations of rape made in 2002", its London Metropolitan University suggesting "47,000 rapes were actually committed every year," have to analyse their methodlolgy on that one.

A woman can accuse a man (or woman) of rape &amp; have her id hidden, whilst the other has his id shown without even coming to trial. False rape accusations are high as there is no serious punishment for accusation, that is different in countries where the punishment received would be the same given to the accuser, i.e. a false accusation about a robbery/raper is 3/7 year jailtime, well that's what the false accuser would get. Its the high number of false accusers that make it harder for women to come forward. Stressfull for a raped men to come forward with the stigma associated (especially different cultures), so that 1,310 figure is more likely to be under-reported.

The rape/domestic violence industry has to demonise men to show it is a problem, to get funding &amp; stay employed. As already mentioned by another poster, its looking at Violence against women and children (VAWC) only, ignoring funding for abused men. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/mad.gif" alt=":mad:"/>
It is all about money, even if you pick a career with the sole purpose of caring for others; ask any boss/manager.

Why no proposal for a woman to be able to go to the police &amp; be rape tested, with no pressure to accuse; so if she does change her mind then the accused more likely to be convicted?
There is an excellent video &amp; comments here <a href="http://ManWomanMyth.com/women/the-false-allegation-epidemic/">http://ManWomanMyth.com/women/the-fa...tion-epidemic/</a>. This is why rape conviction rates are low, too many false accusations. Wouldn't you want to know <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2074339/Cry-rape-slap-wrist-Teenage-girl-lies-left-man-prison-savagely-beaten-gets-80-fixed-penalty-notice.html">about Jess Cooper</a> if she was at your Uni? Police time &amp; taxpayer money (also boyfriend jailed) wasted rather than for a genuine victim.
Here is a list <a href="http://register-her.com/index.php?title=False_Rape_Accusers">http://register-her.com/index.php?ti..._Rape_Accusers</a> &amp; <a href="http://falserapesociety.blogspot.com/">http://falserapesociety.blogspot.com/</a> (not all UK), notice their "penalties"!

Excuse the detail, worked in MI for years &amp; analysing stats (debunking) is fun.

Completely agree. False accusations are a massive problem. They can ruin the lives of the men who are falsely accused, even if they are later to be found innocent that stigma will remain, and I think just as importantly it stops other women coming forward to report rape, because they believe that they will not be taken seriously. The people who knowingly falsely acuse men should have a sentence equal to that of rape in my opinion.
