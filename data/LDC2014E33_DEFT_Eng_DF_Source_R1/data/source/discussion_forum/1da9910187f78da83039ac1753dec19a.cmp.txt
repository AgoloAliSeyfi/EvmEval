Ummm.. I'm still shell-shocked by this line from the article:

"Cambridge has 15 elementary and middle schools and one high school. While the city spends $17,000 a year on each public-school student, the schools' quality is considered uneven."

They spend what? The top 10 school systems in the state spend an average of just over $5,000 per student per year. The school system my daughter graduated from last May (25 miles from Cambridge) was the #7 system in the state and spends an average of right at $4,700 per student per year. I'd really be interested in knowing what Cambridge is doing with $17,000 a year per student. That HAS to be a typo... Maybe it was supposed to be $7,000...

Beyond that, I think they'll find the same situation in the end that Berkley High School found in the link I provided a few pages back. You can integrate the schools by whatever means you may like but in the end the kids segregate themselves within the school whether it's by race, gender, socio-economic status or any other factor.

On one hand we and our schools teach our kids to note differences and catagorize but then on the other we don't want them to do it. There comes a point where the schools are fighting themselves. How does a kindergarten teacher demonstrate the differences between a red block and a blue circle to their students and then society not expect those very same kids from noticing the skin color, gender, etc of the others in the room with them?

I think the Cambridge School Board's heart is in the right place but I think we need to have a few of these systems do it for several years and look at some long term results before we play "educational experiment" on another generation of kids on a wholesale basis.

Dear 'fishin:

You have implicitly identified why AA in the name of diversity is the wrong approach and actually makes things worse. When society -- leaders, politicians, school administrators, etc. -- continually talk about racial differences and then implement programs and policies based on race, then the natural response is to strive for your own race. Race is magnified.

Tell a black child that "whitey" is the cause of his status and he will either give up or hate whites or both. Why would anyone be surprised that he chooses the "black" table at lunch? Surveys over the years of HS students show "fairness" at the top of the list for teachers.

Sure, I'm over-simplfying, but neither of us are responsible for World history or American history. A baby born today should be raised to expect fairness by schools and government. S(he) should get "equal protection under the law".

I know from first-hand experience that my minority classmates could learn and excel along with my white classmates. The HS I attended was one-third black and we did not even think about race. (Well, a bit.) Standards were high, graduation rates were high. I never heard of "favoritism". Something happened over the years to change this.
BTW, this was a "low-income" school.

I taught at a major University and I asked a black student what 10 divided by 2 was. He grabbed for his calculator! I told him never to let his batteries die. He should have been counselled to go to a community college for remedial work in Math. OR he should have been taught this in HS. AND the point is that this advice is race-neutral.
Admitting students with low test-scores and then flunking them or watching them drop-out is no favor.

Enough for now.

Example of effects of affirmative action is the black reporter fired after 3 years in the NYT for gross plagiarism, misrepresentation, falsifying travel and other expenses, etc. All of you read his name in the news reports - how many reports did you see stating that he's black?

HofT - IMO, it's reaching pretty far to say that AA programs were in any way responsible for that reporters misconduct.

Fishin - certainly not stating any such thing. Simply observing that it's not likely that any employee not "protected" by affirmative action would have survived for 3 years after 30+ warnings on his behavior. That's a hypothesis, and it's based on the extraordinary multi-page explanation published by the newspaper. And no, Dys, it's not a personal remark about the person, whom I don't know &lt;G&gt;
