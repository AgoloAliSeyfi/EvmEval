I know this is completely off tangent but the title of this thread fits this bomb (no pun intended). There is a suggestion that India was AQ Khan's 4th customer

It would appear that India did buy somethings from this network but whether they knew it was of Pakistani origins is not answered.

Heh, i was wondering whether to post it or not, it seems rather light and based just on looks.

A transcript of Pollacks Carnegie Jan 23 talk is <a href="http://www.fednews.com/transcript_free.htm?id=20120123t1078">here</a>. Gives timelines of when various countires AQ Khan proliferated to and the way he screwed them over with non working designs. The implication is they were only too happy to give him up. Iran however is another matter entirely, they've protected him very well to date.

There was an huge discussion on this at BR and we have come to the conclusion it was the RAW who purchased from A.Q. Khan. How do you find out quickly about the extent of nuclear technology of A.Q. Khan and what kind of nuclear technology he has? Easy. Just buy it from him and see what he can do. It is well known that A.Q. Khan has a very huge ego. A little stroke of massaging of A.Q. Khan's ego and he will spill the beans, er.. brag, about his work.

Not really, only a few posts and then the discussion moved on to more pressing concerns like Kudankulam protests and the supposed church's involvement in it (!).

This was as a result of the playboy magazine article that came out around that time. Playboy magazine of all places !! isn't WAPO, NYTeims or the sunday edition of the Times of London the customary newspapers where such bombshells are exposed.

BR thread is <a href="http://forums.bharat-rakshak.com/viewtopic.php?p=1215424&amp;sid=e216ecd1161e76756945ebcaab131017#p1215424">here</a> of which the most pertinent comment i found was by JE Menon

While the possibility that AQ Khan (and basically this means Pakistan) sold nuclear technology to India is totally counter-intuitive, practically unthinkable really, it is not totally inconceivable. The Indians, if nothing else are generally mild and non-confrontational but also ruthlessly realistic. Consider:

1. The strategic environment in those days was extremely restrictive. India was sanctioned heavily in the nuclear sector, with certain arrangements having been arrived at amongst the NPT signatories specifically targeting India.

2. At the same time, the US due to its own strategic exigencies, was turning a blind eye to the fact that Pakistan was busy developing a nuclear capability of its own. The US did this because it wanted to keep the anti-Soviet Jihad in Afghanistan going.

3. Obviously, the Indians knew what AQ Khan was up to. The Pakistani nuclear program was certainly closely tracked by Indian intelligence. They also knew they could do next to nothing to prevent it, given the American posture on the matter.

4. In such a situation, in view of the fact that India was still developing its own capability, is it inconceivable that New Delhi decided that it would use the only proliferation network that was “protected” by the US? This would have been a subtle way of
(a) getting back at Pakistan, i.e. making them provide the rope which Indians would use to hang them (at least in Pakistani minds);
(b) use the Pakistani key to unlock the American firewall around Pakistan’s nuclear activities; and
(c) keep an inside track of what Pakistan was up to in the proliferation business.

On the Indian side, it cannot have been anything but a state operation, and almost certainly an intelligence operation. There is a certain subtle elegance in getting your enemies to provide you with the capability that they themselves firmly believe you would use to exterminate them, and more deliciously get it with the support of the Pakistani military establishment, whose raison d’etre is the destruction of India. And the approach would be typically Indian. (Suggestion: read the Arthashastra by Kautilya – from approximately 300 BC, to get an idea of what I’m talking about. It is the ancient Indian treatise on Politics).

Having said that, there is nothing that can remotely pass as evidence (at least in the public domain) that such transactions did occur. Josh Pollack's article raises the possibility, and certainly it will be examined in more critical detail in the coming weeks if the buzz lasts that long. If not, it will lie dormant, until someone from India sheds light on this. Fat chance of that.

If there is any truth to this, I would have to say that this operation ranks right up there with anything Mossad has done. The delicious irony would be if AQK was informed about the identity of "the customer" after the "sale" happened, thereby tying him and his network to secrecy for ever, never able to mention the "customer's" name, because he would be lynched by public opinion in Pakistan, and this great secret protected by the Pakistan armed forces!!

Plausible ? who knows, maybe. Anything more i kinda doubt it.

<quote orig_author="Blademaster">
RAW wanted to be able to estimate how much power would Pakistan need to run its centrifuge, how much materials would Pakistan need to make a viable kg of nuclear materials so India could estimate the prowess of Pakistan's nuclear program.

I bet there was a huge initial uproar of denial.

You would think but i cannot recall much mention in the media here, appeared in a few newspapers but nothing more. The BR discussion on it is minimal for something like this.

Did not become a topic of discussion here until today, effectively two months after the playboy article came out.
