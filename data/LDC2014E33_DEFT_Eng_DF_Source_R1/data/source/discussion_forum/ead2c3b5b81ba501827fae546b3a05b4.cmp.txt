Having spent the last few hours reading this thread in its entirety, it's very clear that a lot of people feel very passionately about the subject. I am the same- so much so that I have created an account just to put a few words out there of my own.

Firstly, let me establish a few things. I am white British from a long line of white British people- my genetic background isn't very diverse, I come from a very poor background- but I aspire to break out of my class with a good education.

I believe that people should be allowed to love, marry or just **** whoever they like. I believe in personal freedom as much as the next person. My arguments have nothing to do with that. However, what I mean to argue is this:

Multiculturalism- an appreciation, respect and integration for all cultures, that is something to be aspired to as a nation. However- simply using such a beautiful idea as an excuse for the government to flood the country with foreigners willing to work for a disgusting wage is insulting to the idea. Mass excessive immigration is not multiculturalism. In fact not being multicultural is what most of the people on this board are worried about! It is not multicultural to replace one culture with another. It is multicultural to have a balance. What people are worried about is not that there are other cultures around us, but that- in being so eager to invite new cultures into Britain- we have neglected our own. It has become racist to take pride in being British- to like the fact we drink tea, go to the pub, perform Nativities in primary school (not because we are Christian, but because it is a tradition we want to share with our children), to keep calm and carry on, to celebrate our history, our food, our language, our festivals, our sensibilities- our entire British way of thinking. Our culture. Our culture does exist.

I want to learn about your culture. I want to enjoy everything the world has to offer. But I don't want to fear being proud of my beautiful country and being proud of being part of a family that is responsible for building it. I don't want to be told I'm racist because I don't want one thousand years of history to disappear in the wake of overzealous liberalism. Immigration is okay if people want to integrate- but most of them don't. We just get self imposed segregation from micro-societies who don't care about learning our language or about our culture- but who are all too ready to impose their own on us.

I could throw around statistics about crime rates, about the looming date by which 'white' people are to become a minority. But it's been done, so I wont. The facts are out there for those who care to read them, this gradual elimination of British culture either bothers you or it doesn't. *shrug* It bothers me.

That's a load of bull****e

You're gloryifying Breivik and his points of view.

That is disgusting.

The mask in your signature represents everything that is in complete opposition to your views.

No, There's supporting his views and supporting what he did. I support his views on immigration.

There is a difference between the two, I suggest you learn it.

Ok, so:

Would some backwards English hating liberal on here (there are clearly many), care to explain to me why ONLY white countries need 'multiculturism'?

What is it about white people which means they need replacing and have other cultures replace them?

Why is 'multiculturism' not needed in Africa? In Asia? In black and brown countries? Where are the liberals proposing that millions of white christians are sent there to 'enrich' thier culture and countries?

I dont expect an answer, because afterall, we all know that liberals who promote this nonsense, dont live in areas affected by immigration, and dont care about the effects it has had on this country in recent times.

So tell me, why do only white countries need 'multiculturism' and 'enriching'?
