What's really sad is the left wing crazies around here, lead by Marcatl, who are using the tragic murder of that young kid in Florida to bash Fox News. And out and out lying about the coverage too, Sheppard Smith has been talking about it for the better part of 45 minutes, and they've covering it all day. You guys have absolutely no creditability at all.

It Marc was white and starting thread after thread defending Zimmerman, he'd be called a racist. And for good reason, in my opinion. Marc is a racist. Sad but true.

</quote>

How do you know Marc is not White?

(Oh, and for the record, I am not a roasted turkey with an eerie resemblance to Michael Richards)

</quote>

He's not, if I am to believe what he has told me in the past. In fact, I believe he is of Caribbean descent. He can correct me, of course.

All in all, Marc can be a dick at times and I certainly let him know when he is. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/wink.gif"/> But, I do respect his passion for equal rights. He's OK by me. I think a lot of folks need to reign in their emotions more and look objectively at situations, but then not everyone can be as wonderful as I am. *joke*

(And, thank goodness they aren't. Life would be very boring for me.)

Oh wowza...Sheppard Smith talked about it for a WHOPPING ten minutes.

Big whoop! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/>

I'd still need to see a link to believe that tripe.

As I said, asswipe, he covered it for quite some time, I'd say for 45 minutes at a minimum. And the other news anchors covered it earlier in the day and you'll see it later too.

The truth is you don't believe it cuz you don't wanna believe it. And that's fine, your entitled to whatever you wanna think. But don't be pretending you want a serious conversation minus any bias, cuz you can't offer the same. Why don't you tune into Fox News dipshit, and see for yourself? Might I suggest the lead story at or near the top of every fucking hour until O'Reilly shows up?

I'm going to watch all the FOXNEWS shows tonight like a hawk.

From what I've seen thus far, they've been a day late and a dollar short. Tepid and very light coverage when they did cover it...spinning it more like it's an opportunity for the Left to grab their second amendment rights away from them.

Maybe they just report the facts and don't waste time creating faux outrage without some legally sound facts to back it up?

Maybe they don't want to whip up hatred for the sake of ratings?

Maybe they don't like race baiting?

Wipe your chin, Marc, you're drooling again.

Ok, lay off the sauce. This is FOXNEWS we're talking about. They whip up Obama hatred on a daily, sometimes hourly, basis.

Even their website stokes fear and hatred of Obama:

Earlier, it had a story about Obama's trip to Oklahoma this morning to announce the pipeline construction, and their headline was "Obama's Pipe Dream".

They are just not honest actors.

Everyone knows that CalifornaGurl is the biggest, lyingest, boozing whino on the Interwebs.

You can smell the booze coming out of her pores a mile a way. She stinks to high-heaven of it.

Don't you see how she's always running off at the mouth spewing total nonsensical swill?

Remember the two years of Obama's Presidential Campaign? Well I watched FOXNEWS daily for like 14 - 16 of those months straight...I mean every show. It finally got to be too much, the hatred, the race-baiting, the racism, the outright lies...I fled and haven't turned back since. Hannity's the worst, he's like the FOXNEWS version of CalifornaGurl...he just lies so stinkin much.
