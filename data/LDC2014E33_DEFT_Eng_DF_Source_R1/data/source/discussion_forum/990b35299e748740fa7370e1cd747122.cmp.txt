Can we please stay on topic? Thanks to Oltz - we have Romney's plan.

<quote orig_author="Oltz">
Just to refresh everyone on the Romney plan. Ohh and to mention that he actually has a fairly detailed plan something that we still have never seen from the current administration unless we "pass it so we can read it".

I have just re read the PDF detailing each of these points and must honestly say I can not out right shoot down any of them which I was suprised by. Can someone like Evo or another more "liberal" person please actually read the 59 points and maybe even the entire PDF and give a real "dem" review ?

I still am not sure what I think of Romney, but these seem like sane and reasonable points. The simple existance of a coherent plan makes me feel better about him and his team.

Why is it in an "Anybody but Obama" election year, the Republicans are nominating the candidate most like Obama?

After reading the 59 point Romney list - I don't see a similarity with President Obama - other than maybe people like them both personally?

Perhaps one of our Nuclear experts would like to comment on these 2 points?

"31. Expand NRC capabilities for approval of additional nuclear reactor designs

32. Streamline NRC processes to ensure that licensing decisions for reactors on or adjacent to approved sites, using approved designs, are complete within two years"

Is this realistic?
