I usually just lurk around this site and having spent some time now reading this thread I feel the need to a least post just this one time on WGBH's behalf. Please keep in mind that this is only my opinion, based upon my own experiences with "bigfoot-like" creatures in the woods. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

John is pretty brave to be posting his experience on this site, for sure, and I am duly impressed at how well he is being treated here, for the most part.

However, I just have to say that I think it is ludicrous for John to accept any other explanation for his encounter except for what it is. He saw a bigfoot-like creature. I believe him.

I wrote a dissertation awhile back on the BFF, that I expounded on more in one of my blog writings, concerning the different personalities in the "bigfoot community". Part of it concerned the differences between "believers" and "knowers".

The difference between John and some others is that John is a "knower", not a "believer". You can "believe" all the evidence (whether it is scientific or not) that you want, but until you have your own sighting, you can never be a "knower". Whether he likes it or not, John is in the class of "Knowers".

Only those who "believe" in bigfoot will argue with a skeptic. Those that "know" these creatures exist won't waste their time. It is something like a Christian arguing with an Atheist about religion. It is a no-winner, for either side.

I am not a amateur psychiatrist, like some folks here, however I truly believe that those that claim to have had hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations must be truly weak minded to believe that malarkey and to believe that it applies to John's experience. (Don't take it personal, I am not slamming anybody in particular).

John may be weak willed, but he sure as hell is not weak minded. Anybody that has read his postings on the various forums/messages boards can attest to that.

You guys have been so busy sharpening Occam's Razor in this thread that it has become a dull blade. John has posted his encounter. He has never wavered from what he has originally stated concerning his encounter. I think he has done a pretty good job, considering he was 17 when it happened. I am sure there could be more learned from him, however, his PTSD over the incident probably has closed his mind off to some of the events and he can't recall everything.

One thing I would like to mention, that I hope John finds useful in his quest to unravel this mystery, is that based upon my own experiences with these creatures, I believe that John's encounter involved not one, but two creatures. These creatures hardly ever hunt singularly. They almost always tag-team. I am not sure what the purpose is when they are foraging for plant foodstuffs, unless one is supposed to stand watch while the other eats. When hunting live prey, one seems to always drive the prey into an ambush by the other.

I find it doubtful, that the one that John saw, put "the stink" on him. There is no indication in John's report that the creature passed by his deer stand, before he stepped out in front of him. Given that John was guesstimating that the creature was approximately 50 yds in front of him, I find it doubtful that any smell was being given off from the creature that John could have smelled. I believe that the "stink" that John smelled probably came from the other creature that was hiding in the brush closer to the deer stand.

(Oh, and speaking of the "stink" that John got a whiff of, just like a "creature sighting", there is no way a person can ever truly describe the "smell". It is like nothing you have ever smelled before and once you smell it, you will never forget it. It will make your eyes water and can very well make you "sick to your stomach".)

I don't believe these creatures are harmful to humans, however, it is not the one you see in the woods that you should be worried about, it is his partner hiding behind you in the brush that should give you cause for reflection. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/smile.gif"/> I can only imagine how much more John's reaction would be if he ascertained that another creature was closer to the deer stand during his encounter.

Of course, like I said earlier in this post, these are only my opinions, base upon my own experience with these creatures. I am not here to post about my experiences. Just to give John some "food for thought" concerning his own encounter.

The only other thing that I would tell John is that I wouldn't let a bad experience when I was 17 keep me from going out and having some fun in the woods.

I think you should buck up, go out into the woods, find the sucker and kick him in the ass! <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

So i am considered by you to be "truly weak minded" well that's a confident statement from someone that considers himself to be "not even an amateur psychiatrist"

Everyone who has been asking me to describe the smell, Pywacket just described it very well.

I am sorry, I need to take a break from answering these questions right now. No one has done anything wrong, my health is not good at the moment. I apologize and I thank you for being kind. I will be OK soon and return.
