@nicodemus,

thanks for the info, but i my overlying theme remains the same, im referring to the kid who downloads the aforementioned frank sinatra song, burns it to a cd, and then gives the cd to his girlfriend, technically piracy, as is any kind of distribution of media, take another example, schools hold a movie night fundraiser, parents pay 5 dollars to go see some disney movie with their kids on a projector from some kids dvd collection, technically warrenting a 250000 dollar fine and 3-7 years in a federal penetentiary. Hence, could the law not be revised to state that as long as it was bought from the original producer, the right to do with it what one wills is with the purchaser

@nicodemus,

Funny thing about this is that there was just a case, which I don't know was settled or not, in which the RIAA is actually losing the battle in the piracy issue (Anderson v. RIAA?). Not only is the issue problematic legally speaking, but also it is just plain unpopular, which has a very big sway on the conception of the suit.

If I understand the gist of your opinion, you state that a copyrighted material (i.e. music) is completely open to the purchaser when the cash is put in the vendors hands. I both agree and don't agree with you. I agree with you in the respect that when you pay for something, you had dang well have ownership of it. It does not make sense to buy something only to be put in sever restraints while owning it. However, suppose I am software developer and I develop an application that cost me thousands of dollars to make and lots of time. I have my company's survival on the line depending on the success of this application. Then, the first guy that buys the application copy's it, publicly utilizes it outside the terms of the license agreement, etc. I'm out a lot of money and I am not going to make anymore software again. I think it would even extend as far as a public screening of a movie my company would make. Imagine if half the theaters that screened Dark Knight personal use, but not for personal use for personal/public gain. That's profiting from another work, which is not right. Ironically, I could personally download the hell out of anything and everything in a six-million Gigabyte radius. You could name it, I could
