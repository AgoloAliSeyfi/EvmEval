Obama distanced himself from Rev Wright's rhetoric. And did he really say 'deserve' or is that a construct of your empty headed biased ignorance? But the point is, you hypocrites don't distance yourselves from the likes of Rush boy because that all is all you have: stone throwers. Do you defend Bush while you criticize Obama? Hypocrite, add elvis to your list.

Oh what have I done? blasphemed against the Messiah?

He didn't distance himself from the rhetoric. he continued to attend the church after he made the comments. Wright said 9/11 was "America's chickens coming home to roost" He also said "Goddamn America" because of the three strike law. He also said whites started aids to kill the blacks and Obama did not stop attending the church. Nice to see you defend not only Obama for being associated with the lunatic, but the lunatic himself.

I don't listen to Rush, so you fail again, dipshit.

With all the pastors that have made that claim lately, I wonder how people can still go to those specific churches.

because they believe the rhetoric.

Thank you for putting words in my mouth, but no, I was not implying that the right doesn't do it. What I was saying is that that particular tactic is thematic of left-wing respondents. That's all I meant. I have not noticed that is "thematic" in right-wing respondents. If you would care to show that I'm mistaken, I may reconsider my opinion.

My original post was:

Political Chic said:

I'm not getting where she changed the subject and attacked. She argued by example that wishing a conservative would die, was, if not a common tactic, at least one in their bag of tricks by showing they had used before.

Post by Yurt:

Again, I don't see where this is a "change the subject and attack" situation. The issue was the Golf Reporter's comments. The issue was raised about the right being as upset as with the Sykes comments and this was the response. The Golf guy did apologize. Seems like this was drawing a fair distinction between the results in two somewhat similar cases.

Post by Willow:

The issue was WA State cutting taxes on newspapers. The post says that Kerry is writing legislation that would do the same thing for the NYTimes. I don't see how that is changing the subject. Still tax cuts for the papers. The theme of the hypocrisy of the left in supporting tax cuts in this instance is carried from one post to the next.

Post by Sinatra:

Remarkable is it not? The leftists are openly admitting that tax cuts ENHANCE opportunity for business growth and sustainability, but only doing so for selective examples that suit their personal political goals.

This is blatant statism here - choose certain businesses for tax cuts, thus ensuring future support by said businesses.

Good lord what a joke - and a dangerous one at that...

Again, the subject isn't changed.

i really don't care where his kids go to school....but it is hypocritical to point to republicans or mccain and proclaim, they're out of touch with the common people and then send your kids to the elite of the elite private schools...

</quote>

The topic was Obama sending his kids to private school and not supporting the voucher program in DC so that poor kids could have the same advantage as his daughters. I don't see how this changes the subject and attacks. It seems on point to me.

So far it seems like you are 0 fer....maybe you can point out what I didn't see in those posts.

</quote>

you see them as supporting their arguement but when liberals do it they are changing the subject. I posted an article about a golfer and yurts response was where was obama's apology changing the subject back to obama.
As for the private school deal since we attacked McCain for living the high life, he had to put it back on obama for sending his kids to private school so therefore obama is hypocrit instead of discussing the real issue behind the voucher program. The whole thread on the voucher program was started to divert the subject from the real issue.
As for PC instead of discussing the one issue she had to bring up something that happened almost twenty years ago, therefore not really addressing the issue at hand.

If your kidneys don't work, you die.

As for the second comment, if anyone said that about Obama, the PC police would be out in full force and you know it.

I'm not a medical doctor, but I'm pretty sure if you don't get very prompt attention, you die.

Kinda like a heart attack. At least that's what I'm thinking it's like. Thankfully I'm not an expert in renal failure.
