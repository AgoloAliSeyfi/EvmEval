the quran no more demands a theocracy then judasim and christianity (although I suppose with the NT overriding the OT, perhaps not as much christianity). they all have numerous laws and commandments in personal, legal and spiritual matters that the followers are supposed to abide by. hell, have you even read the old testament? how on earth can you not think that is calling for a theocracy?

the fact that the vast majority of muslims don't live in theocratic states shows that, like all religions, islam is fine when practiced in moderation.

That doen't change what Islam demands though, does it? That is simply what Muslims practice, and the two are rather different.

And Islam is rather different, it allows for no seperation of Church and State, it is a total lifestyle.

the same could be said of any religion. and besides, this discussion started because I said a theocracy was a bad example of a muslim state, which is still true, even if it is what their religion demands

and again, the old testament. it makes it pretty damn clear that there is no separation.

Similarly to how not all claims are created equal, and individual claims require differing levels of evidence, neither are all religions created equal and it is rational to dislike a certain religion over another if one can be shown to be more detrimental to another. So it is irrelevant that you believe all religion plays a negative role, even though I agree with you, because our priorities should be focused on those which are the most detrimental. Would you honestly have us use the same resources in combating the negative effects of Islam and combating the negative effects of Jainism?

I would also like you to back up your assertion that Christianity, which in this country is in a weak and almost laughable form, is playing a more negative role in Britain's society than Islam is right now.

Also, reading your posts you appear to be a highly arrogant, self-righteous, and cocky person. Your last sentence is almost cringe worthy in its self-importance. You're 21. Time to get some humility and eat some humble pie, because I guarantee you're going to be wrong on countless things throughout your life.

You forgot to mention his spelling and grammar. Awful, considering how 'British' this chap is.

I keep frequently seeing threads made hating on Islam, which is somewhat hypocritical and disturbing I believe in many cases.

I am an Atheist; therefore I am not trying to defend Islam out of being 'Islamic' before I am accused of that. I am also considered by British nationalists to be 100% British (Although I reject the idea that it makes a real difference), so I am not showing sympathy for Islam out of experiencing similar hostility or racism.

However, I do believe that Islam and Christianity, along with other major religions, all play very similar and negative roles in the world. Therefore, I do not believe we should be cherry-picking Islam as some specific evil, but rather opposing all religions for the extremely negative roles they play in the world.

The usual argument held against Islam is that it is responsible for terrorism. This may be correct, but the fact of the matter is; whether somebody is using Islam to commit terrible acts, regardless of the wrongdoing, all major religion play a large role in shaping societies, and ultimately, fulfil playing a very similar negative role.

And when using the idea that Islam ‘inspires terrorism’, if we were honestly that bothered about such wrong-doing in the world, then we would surely be more concerned with ending the much more severe crisis’s and wrong-doing’s such as starvation and war. Both of these ills are far more widespread and important than the threat of terrorism, as of which we are more liking to die by our own hands rather than by the hand of an 'Islamic terrorist'.

It is almost unbelievable how the idea that a Christian should have any sympathy or support when they proclaim a dislike for Islam, when the religion they subscribe to right now in Britain, is playing a much more negative role.

We should oppose religion simply on the basis that all religion plays a negative role. But we should not bully specific religions because of certain conditions and influences of the societies we presently live in.

This is of course, an argument only for those who aspire to reason, rationality and evidence in mind. I have no expectation that I will be receive any support for my remarks by Christians or other adherents of major religions.

You don't seem to understand how religion works in this world. Different religions don't exist, they are corrupted versions of the one true religion, which was revealed through the prophets. However, if everyone actually followed their own scriptures, the problem would be solved very easily, as they all point to one outcome. At the very least, agreeing upon what is common in each holy scripture would be a good start, and it would bring each "religion" closer together. This includes Atheism, even if you think of it as "no religion", as it is still a belief system.
