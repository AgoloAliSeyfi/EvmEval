Fair enough. But in all honesty, WHO ACTUALLY CARES? We are all humans, its a piece of land at the end of the day. Im not gunna spend my time here squabbling over skin colour and arguing over which border line i was born in. If your going to come to Britain and contribute to the economy, local community or learn at a school/university then all be it! No matter what your skin colour or nationality. /thread

The majority of the country supports diversity. It's our strength. So we need to keep it up, not nullify it. A more mixed race nation is good thing and will only happen if we allow more immigrants to come in. So IMO as I said in another thread, the immigration policy over the last 10 years has been correct.

85 percent White British yes, but the outright majority are all of old age who will soon die. The sheer amount of mass immigration in recent years, coupled with a rapidly expanding decended immigrant population (very high birthrate, white British on the other hand extremely low birthrate)(quarter of all babies have a foreign parent, excluding 2nd/3rd generation immigrants) and white flight will, as many survey's and predictions have said, the white british will be a minority in 50 years..

Not forgetting! the 85 percent takes into account NI/Scotland and Wales. Taking the most populated area of the Kingdom,England, you will see the white british are far fewer in numbers, take into account urban populations, as the immigrant population is urban centred. As you know many parts of London are virtually all of foreign decent..

So what if it the 21st century? So called diversity preachers like you are only harming diversity. Mixing everything into one big melting pot isnt preserving the previous races/ethnicities is it?

Britain should be white, just as Japan should be Japanese and so on.. that is real diversity. Want to experience another culture? by all means visit it I certainly do.. doesnt mean we need every single one on our doorstep.

People like you are obviously jealous that people can have the best of both worlds. Mixed race people are often healthier, more intelligent and better looking. Science has shown this. Get over it you facist.

Wow... Simply wow. 21st century Nazi by any chance?

Should I break up with my black boyfriend then? To prevent ''mixing everything into one big melting pot''?

I don't even know where to start with you. ''Britain should be white''! What do you even mean by that?! Many black people contribute to the British society just as much as white people do.

You are a racist and people like you should be named and shamed.

Yes, I didnt expect an answer.

I simply want to know why the backwards liberals on here want to wipe out the English race from thier own country, and dont give a toss if the English become a minority....in England.

Is that too much to ask?

Yeah, it is actually.

Yes, but not necessarily for the worse, and perhaps this is so superficial that it need not create a change at all.
