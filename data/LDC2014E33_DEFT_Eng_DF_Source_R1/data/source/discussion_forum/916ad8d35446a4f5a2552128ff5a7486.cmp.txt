How can you ask me about the national debt growing 6 trillion per year when it grew 6 trillion during Bush's 8 years?

Seriously, try to focus.

It grew by that amount because the non-operating debts outside of the budgetary process rose. I explained how that occurs here.

It is for the same reason why the debt rose under Clinton, even though Slick Willie ran operating budget surpluses.

Could and should not this "debts outside the budgetary process) costs have been predicted reasonably close and budgeted for? I mean it is a real cost/debt right?

That is how I do my budget....

Why didn't we hear about the deficit during the Bush administration?

</quote>

Because democrats don't even pretend to give a shit about the deficit.

And republicans only do when a democrat is in the white house.

I thought everyone understood this. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/confused.gif"/>

Just like republicans don't bother pretending to give a shit about civil liberties (bearing arms notwithstanding).

And democrats only pretend to care when a republican is in the white house.

Government by the people, for the people and of the people is a big ruse.

Again, I thought most people understood this.

And that has what to do with answering my queston?

Many do in essence print their own money with credit.

Tomorrow is the State of the Union and Obama will be talking about the huge deficit we have. Why didn't we ever hear about it during the Bush admin when during his admin the national debt was more than doubled? The deficits were huge!

But Bush hid them. He didn't put the two wars in the budget like Obama is doing. Remember all those emergency supplementals that congress voted on every few months? 250 billion here, 500 billion there, to fund the wars. We don't have those anymore, because the wars are funded, out in the open, by the budget.

But now, we see the deficit spending that these wars are causing, and suddenly everyone's all outraged.

This money has been draining our treasury for 8 years already.

The 2009 debt number is from the Bush administration's fiscal year. When they post the 2010 numbers, that will be Obama's.

So I was just wondering why the media is so stupid? They keep talking about the huge deficit in the Obama admin. But they never mentioned the doubling of the national debt under the Bush admin. Are they really so stupid that they didn't realize all those war supplementals weren't in the budget and therefore hidden away each year?

Get over yourself huh? We DID hear about the deficit. Every time Bush spent a dime.

Here's some late-breaking news: Bush isn't President. Get over it. It doesn't matter what Bush did. It is irrelevant to your boy outspending Bush's 8 years in one year.
