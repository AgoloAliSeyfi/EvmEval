From talking to ex - scout leaders it seems I have sold my soul to BP by agreeing to help out.......... I'm actually V excited as it all seems like fun, but all ex leaders are V cynical?

Im an ex leader of a cub pack and I wish I wasnt!

I just do not have the time any more becuase of work (new job/location etc) but I was a leader for 10 years. It is very rewarding but very hard work. It is not just an hour and a half a week....its all the meetings, prep, competitions, camps etc Some things, like camps, you plan for in advance and I did not see this as 'extra' most years, our 3 yearly camps where mini holidays for me as I could not afford to go on holiday myself.
What got me was the district meetings/leader meetings/pack meetings etc. Generally the pack meeting was after the cubs had gone home...planning what we were doing for the next 6 weeks etc and that didnt really bother me because I was already there and we could get alot planned/look at resources from our cub board/ask the kids what badges if any they would like to work towards. The district meetings, (all cub leaders in the district meet) in my opinion, where a pain, always on a thursday and you always got talked into doing something else! Leader meetings (where all leaders of your group get together) where always on a Wednesday (1 a month) and these are where you disscuss any group activities (group camp)/up keep of the building/any grants for fundraising etc. Some months, meetings can be in the same week!

All in all, it is a great experience and I hope you have great fun, I really miss it. xx

I'm an ex Beaver leader. I hated it. I was sort of conned into it when i was asked if i would "help out for an hour" on a Friday night at the meetings. It turned into 3 years. I hated going out in the dark in the winter, i hated having to prepare "exciting" things to do each week, i hated Camp weekends, i hated the compulsory training courses. I hated the uniform, the meetings, the parades, and on and on and on !! At the time i just went along with it all because my son was there, when he said he didn't want to go to Cubs i could have cried with joy ! Scout leaders are a special breed of people, they're great motivators and organisers and really enjoy what they do. I can motivate and organise quite well but prefer adults to kids ! Being a leader is what you make it, i was lucky that i ran the group with a friend who was passionate about Scouting, she sort of carried me ! It was mutually agreed that i would turn up, do what i had to do and just generally be there ! There were some fun times, honest ! Just not for me i'm afraid. Good luck <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/smile.gif"/>
