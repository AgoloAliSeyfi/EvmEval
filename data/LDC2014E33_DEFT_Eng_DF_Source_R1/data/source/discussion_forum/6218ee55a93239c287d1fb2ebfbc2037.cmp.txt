An interesting article from the Mail:

<quote>
"I am impressed with Alan Pardew, even though we haven't had the results we hoped for. I have faith in him. He is an important part of this club moving forward." - Eggert Magnusson, exactly eight days ago. And so the cold blast from Scandinavia arrives just two games later. Two defeats, admittedly, two poor performances, certainly, but does the Egg-head and his mate with the money have any idea what West Ham and their manager have gone through to get here?

West Ham fans are said to be planning a mass demonstration on Sunday. Instead of coming together to join forces and support the team as Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo roll into town, they will once again unite against the board. Bright move, Eggert.

A new board, but another short-sighted, panic-riddled mess. A bright, brilliant manager has been sacked. It's chaos at Upton Park again, the bubbles have burst. The manager who, eventually, restored respect, direction and discipline has been fired.

If Magnusson says one thing and then does the other, how can he be trusted? If bad decisions get their just rewards, West Ham will be playing at Hull next season.

Pardew overcame a vicious, dissenting support who needed to blame someone for the betrayal of their loyalty and the sale of their stars. He restored faith and belief in the club.

His players cannot escape so easily. They will continue on new, fat, long contracts - and it should be noted some were given longer deals than recommended by the manager.

Second Season Syndrome, they call it: Nigel Reo Coker, the over-rated captain, Marlon Harewood, Yossi Benayoun, Anton Ferdinand and Paul Konchesky have all suffered a dose. Only Hayden Mullins, Pardew's first signing, can hold up his head.

A walk around the club and you can see the change since Pardew swept it in. Ice baths have been installed in the changing rooms. This was a club whose players once responded to a change of menu and diet under a previous manager by taking it in turns to sneak around the corner and load up with McDonald's. Pardew's modern methods have been embraced.

It's true, West Ham fans, traditionally suspicious of outsiders, took their time to warm to the new manager. But he stood up for every game, never sat down to hide from the abuse, and used a tight budget to rebuild a team.

Once I was a fierce critic too, until he summoned me to his office for a private chat during the dark days of the Championship. Tape recorder off, cards on the table. We spoke at length about the club, his ambitions, his difficulties. It changed my opinion. I had been too quick to judge - now the new owners have been guilty of a similar act of hasty foolishness.

Pardew reached two play off finals and an FA Cup Final in three seasons and signed players such as Dean Ashton and Danny Gabbidon. The club that sold it's stars were buying them once more. How the club have missed Ashton, injured on England duty before the start of the season.

Then the arrogance kicked in. One player was overheard telling his team-mates: "I should be at Manchester United or Arsenal."

A senior colleague mockingly replied: "Do you know what it takes to play for Manchester United, son? You want to take a look at yourself."

Such has been the growing friction emerging all season. Pardew tried to create more competition for places in the summer. As deadline day approached, he wanted Steed Malbranque, Pascal Chimbonda and James Milner. Instead, he was told he could sign Damien Johnson from Birmingham.

Senior members of the coaching staff were impressed with Pardew's attention to detail when signing a new player. Yet when Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano were forced on the manager by the board and their new mate Kia Joorabchian, he had 12 hours' notice.

Despite their promise and ability, it clearly unsettled a tight group, but the fragile mentality of the players meant it provided them with an excuse to down tools. They still beat Arsenal 1-0 only four games ago and Pardew was ultimately judged by Magnusson in a game when the influential Gabbidon and Ferdinand were both injured.

Pardew never hid from the decline in standards. "I won't disguise it and say we've been unlucky. Yes, there have been two or three good performances but, ultimately, defeat, defeat, defeat, defeat. No goals. No clean sheets. That's where we're at," he told me the last time we met.

Frozen out by the Icemen, he will thaw and return soon, possibly at Charlton. But how will West Ham's new owners be able to handle the good old East End heat that is coming their way?

Well results didn't go our way and to be relegated this season would be "costly", I would prefer Curbs to come back and wouldn't it be ironic if Pards went to the Valley

Good set of responses there Rio, and generally, well nearly all, backing Pardew. It's unusual to see so much backing for an ex-manager and noticeable that so many blame the players. Curbishley, as it seems old loyalty is liable to overcome common sense, should be able to turn them around, but is he the type of guy too control swollen head syndrome? Plus it's nearly December, and Charltons season was always over by then............... <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

Someone like Graham would do the job as the ego-maniacs got the sharp edge of his tongue, and on the transfer list in short order, but there aren't too many managers with his (and Fergies) temperament out there.
