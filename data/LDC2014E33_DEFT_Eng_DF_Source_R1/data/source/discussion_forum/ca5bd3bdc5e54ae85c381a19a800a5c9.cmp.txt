It's real simple: Get the hell out of everybody's bedroom and start worrying about the economy. This contraception thing is nothing but a new shiny object to distract the easily distracted and unfocused Republicans.

the GOP has an agenda. They wholeheartedly disagree with the idea that Goveernment can dictate via law what an enterpsie can and can not sell. If the product or service is legal, they should be allowed to sell it. If they choose NOT to sell it, that should be THEIR choice.

That is the crux oif the debate. It happens to be contraception right now...but all along the agenda is the same.....government has no right to tell ANYONE that they HAVE to SELL anything.

i think the crux of the debate is people understanding that contraception (as provided by health care providers) will not "free." it will be included in the cost of your original premium. thus they can not charge an extra co pay or fee for. there are other services this applies to as well, such as mammograms. now... should all men who pay premiums demand that women pay for their own mammograms since 99% of men do not get them?

the way health (and really all) insurance works is that you pay a premium for access to services. when you pay your premium and do not receive any services, you area subsidizing someone else's services. so every month i pay premiums, i help to pay for some guys viagra, or some womans pap smear, or some kids physical. should i be raising hell that they should be paying for those services themselves? but your insurance contract will not allow for that. call your insurance company and demand that none of your premium dollars be used for any services or treatment you disagree with and see what happens.

I hate to break it to you, but grade school boys tall enough to reach the rubber machine on the truck stop bathroom wall can get contraception for next to nothing. Or you can go to planned parenthood where it's passed out like candy. You don't need insurance to get contraception. It's readily available off the shelf.

Actually, the whole "contraception" drum is being pounded by the liberals in an attempt at gotcha politics. If one were being honest, they would know this is about constitutional freedoms rather than denying women "health care". But that is if one is being honest.

sometime rights come into conflict and they need to be resolved. in this case it is the freedom of choice vs. the freedom of religion. the courts will have a difficult time deciding this one. if you rule for freedom of religion, you trample someones right, but if you rule for freedom of choice, you trample someone elses rights.

its a double edged sword.
as cruel as it sound, i would argue freedom of choice wins out on this fact and this alone. the US is a secular society and not everyone believe in or follow religion. now people are still free to choose which religion to follow, but (in this case) ruling in favor or religion would in effect make those of us who do not adhere to that religion forced to follow part of its doctrine.

opinions?

But dont you get it?

The GOP is fighting for freedom of choice.

They are fighting the idea that goivernment has the right to mandate that an insuirance company MUST sell a service...even if they dont want to.

Ironically....they are fightiong for freedom of choice.

Freedom of religion started iut...yes....but Obamas "compromise" was to minimize freedom of choice for the insurance companies.

So now it is a fight for freedom of choice.

The Catholic Church is opposed to contraception for moral reasons.

Where is the morality in creating a life when food and clean water are rare commodities? Where poverty exists and educational opportunities are non existent?

Where is the morality when disease is spread?

Where is the morality when a women is the victim of domestic violence? When a women is forced to conceive and then trapped as the child become a lever to gain more power and more control?

You are aware of course of all of the charitable work the Catholic church does in each of the areas you mention aren't you?

Wry has pretty much already told me in this thread that doing things charitably is meaningless, it has to be done by gov't.

The cathlic church could cure cancer and hand out the cure for free, but if there's no gov't mandate involved, Wry wouldn't support it.

LOL, we both know you're full of shit, that said, when you grow up your opinions will change.
