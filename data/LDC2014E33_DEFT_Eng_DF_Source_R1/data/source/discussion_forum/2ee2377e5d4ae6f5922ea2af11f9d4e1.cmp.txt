In the March 2005 issue of the magazine Popular Mechanics, an article has been constructed to "debunk conspiracy theorists" of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

However, the article, not surprisingly, refrains from reporting on the real evidence and focuses solely on the obvious hoaxes and lies surrounding the attacks.

In an attempt to discredit all 9/11 researchers, the article debunks obvious hoaxes and exaggerations such as a pod on the belly of the airliners, the idea that Flight 175 had no windows, the idea that no jet hit the Pentagon, and the fact that some windows at the Pentagon remained intact.

At the same time, the article completely avoids the evidence that surrounds the true 9/11 skepticism. It fails to report on the warnings from U.S. allies about the attacks, the wargames in Virginia on 9/11, the NORAD "live fly" exercises on 9/11, the fighter planes which were sent the wrong way from Norfolk, the large shares of American and United Airlines stock traded only days before 9/11, and the fact that the Pentagon was struck in the nearly empty, recently reconstructed and strengthened sector.

The Popular Mechanics article boldly asserts that all "9/11 conspiracy theorists" believe the obvious fakes and even goes as far as to accuse those who question the government's explanation of the attacks of disgracing "the memories of the thousands who died that day."

Unfortunately, the article seems to focus on the shady 9/11 websites to make it appear as though the entire idea of 9/11 complicity is all a big joke concocted by storytellers.

Disinformation such as "pods on planes," "no plane hit the Pentagon," "cellphones can't be used in airplanes," "there was no plane at the North Tower," and "there was no plane in Pennsylvania," have stained the image of those who simply desire the truth about 9/11.

Websites such as thewebfairy.com, 911hoax.com, 911closeup.com, physics911.org, reopen911.org, 911skeptics.blogspot.com, rense.com, 911sharethetruth.com, thoughtcrimenews.com/wtc.htm, leftgatekeepers.com, warfolly.com, and 911-strike.com, among others, have unfortunately severely damaged the credibility of the true researchers.

The article also failed to mention that the respectable 9/11 websites which support the idea of complicity have all debunked the hoaxes which it claims these people believe.

If the idea of 9/11 complicity is ever to be taken seriously by the masses, people must stop buying into obvious hoaxes and disinformation and focus solely on the true facts.

I heard about this two weeks ago. Jim Hoffman ( <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/">911research.wtc7.net/</a> ) and Joel Skousen ( <a href="http://www.worldaffairsbrief.com">www.worldaffairsbrief.com</a> ) nicely debunked this fradulent hit piece, which conveniently ignored several key areas of the 9/11 attacks.
