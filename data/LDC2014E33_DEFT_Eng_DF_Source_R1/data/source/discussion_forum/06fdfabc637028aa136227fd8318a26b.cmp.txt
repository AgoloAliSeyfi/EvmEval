Yup, this is what happens when you have a "movement" with no actual leaders....anyone can speak for you and in this case it's Edward Hall III.

Here he is representing the movement in a New York Times piece.

Here he is in a photo with Susan Sarandon.

Here he is being interviewed by Democracy Now. Totally clueless.

Oh noes, no leaders!

Why do you (and others of similar ilk) want the movement to be more effective in promulgating its message? I was under the impression that you didn't agree with it.

A Note from Facebook moderator Leslie Ordeman

We recently put up an article about the Occupy Wall Street protests in the USA -- there is lots of news about it on Syrian television stations.

For sure there is a lot of unhappiness in America about the economic situation. Unemployment is relatively high - nine percent. Housing prices keep falling, hurting more families. There is much debate between the two main American political parties about how to fix the U.S. economy.

We don't know exactly what will happen next. What we do know is:

* the US will have national elections in November 2012 that are not under the control of the American intelligence establishment but rather an independent election authority not controlled by the President or Congress;

* the Occupy Wall Street organizers will be entirely free to run as election candidates or to organize to support candidates;

* Occupy Wall Street groups will not be allowed to destroy public or private property, but they can organize more protests in other cities and they can say whatever they want about the U.S. government without being arrested or shot;

* the police will not shoot thousands of protesters;

* some Occupy Wall Street organizers have been arrested for disturbing public order (blocking traffic) but they won't be tortured, and no family will receive the body of a protester bearing torture marks.

* the international media and NGOs are watching and reporting on the Occupy Wall Street protests without interference from the government;

* the Occupy Wall Street organizers will be free to talk to any American or foreigner who wants to talk to them without fear of arrest;

* the U.S. government may complain that some countries' currency policies are hurting the U.S. economy, but the US government will not tell the world that there is a vague foreign conspiracy for which it lacks any specifics or evidence but that it says is encouraging the Occupy Wall Street or other protest movements.

Something to think aboutâ€¦

If you are referring to repeating what the speaker says, that came from bullhorns being banned in the initial protests. The crowd was repeating what the speakers said so people further away could hear the message.

Politically, Italians have plenty to protest about. Austerity measures, inefficient government, highest-paid politicians in Europe... and naturally, Berlusconi.

</quote>
So maybe the message is that it is time for Berlusconi to think about retiring.

Because these fools don't even know what they are talking about. The link below shows a protestor this weekend holding a sign that says, "Chase, give us our money back". Ummm.....Chase repaid the TARP money (with interest) over two years ago! How can problems be solved if people are too ignorant to even try to figure out what they are?

it has caused many people, worldwide, to question the status quo.
it is a huge success.....and it ain't over yet.

Really? The measure of their success is their declared dissatisfaction with everything?
