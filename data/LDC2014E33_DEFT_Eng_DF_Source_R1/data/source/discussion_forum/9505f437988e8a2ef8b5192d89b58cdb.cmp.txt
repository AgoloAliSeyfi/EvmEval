Faith in Human Nature Restored:

In Bristol today for a radiographer consult.....pop into the Apple store on the way back and pick up an iPad (for a gift). Promptly fell asleep on the P&amp;R bus home. Wake up, get off bus and drive almost all the way home and realize I've left the shiney Apple bag on the bus. Drive quickly back to the P&amp;R, but the bus I arrived on has long gone - wait until it retuns from a lap of Bristol some 40 minutes later - much to my frank amazment, the iPad has been handed to the driver.

Clearly those who travel on buses have a greater level of decency. Had that been on the 5.30pm from Victoria it would have been a goner.

Nice to hear though. Makes me feel all festive. <img src="http://cdn.avforums.com/forums/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>
