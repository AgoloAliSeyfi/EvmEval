I don't believe your ridiculous proposition has ever been before a court, but if you're looking for precedent I can help you...

In 1893, when a massive drought afflicted Texas farmers, Cleveland categorically refused to grant federal aid to the victims. He issued an eloquent written justification for his decision:
Clevelandâ€™s words skillfully represent the contrast between the effects brought about by the voluntary generosity of private parties and those created through the exercise of the coercive powers of government. Private individuals, when not hindered by government intervention, have a choice in how to allocate their funds among the various purposes that they deem to be of importance.

Sorry....but your argument is a FAIL

Grover Cleveland was acting as chief executive. The fact that he told flood victims to fuck themselves has no Constitutional bearing

</quote>

It was a drought, not a flood, and if there was no constitutional authority then, there is no Constitutional authority NOW.

I am afraid there is Constitutional authority to help Americans in times of need. Again, the General Welfare clause allows Congrees to do what they determine is in the best interests of the General Welfare of the people. It has been used for a hundred years and upheld by the courts

Libertarians who only look out for themselves may not like it....but it is the law of the land

FEMA is an authorized federal agency. If you disagree with it's Constitutionality, you are welcome to challenge it in court

What is the policy on federal disaster aid for tornado damage? Insurance should cover most losses. Are we going to cover multi-car fog accidents? I had ice storm damage last year. Where's my check?

I don't see how ron paul is wrong. Americans have big hearts, and can donate on their own accord. Also, the state governments have natural disaster plans. Some of you just love the nanny government... The question is why.

Bitching about FEMA during Katrina, then getting on here and posting about how great federal aid is, doesn't make perfect sense to you?

Why not?!?!?!??!?!

</quote>

because FEMA would have done quite well with Katrina....but Bush was a racist.....and he wanted to control the balck population...

So he intentionally impeded FEMAS success.

Everyone knows that...how come you dont?

Great point, boy do I feel like a dummy <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cry.gif"/>.

All the individual changes Obama personally made to FEMA, truly heroic.

The General Welfare clause doesn't mean what you think it does, you should read what Madison wrote about it, after all, he wrote the fucking thing.

Seems to me that the great ultra advocates of states rights tried all this once before and they got their asses kicked.
It was a good thing that the president of the UNITED STATES back then was a compasionate man. Maybe it was to bad he didn't go with, to the victor goes the spoils.
For those who seem to be such strong proponents of the Consitution...you sure seem to forget quite a bit of how it reads.
Refresh your memory.
We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.
With all of the posts from the teaparty or rightwingers there is one common thread.
MY money.
Everything else is up for grabs

That's a lie.

All the gov't cuts we push for, we want you to get the same tax reduction benefits that we get. I don't want you to be forced to pay for certain gov't programs i like, which is exactly what you promote and advocate for. You want me to pay for what you want, I want you to receive the same tax deduction that I get.

What's the more selfish position there?

</quote>

It is more selfish for those who have the means and the power to take more are selfish.
That is the true selfish attitude among this country.
Really, if President Lincoln had taken everything from the south like the rightwingers and neo cons like to think today, it so would have been a different story in this land.
Imagine! Former black slaves having the ground given to them that those awful slave owners had in their possession. TO THE VICTOR GOES THE SPOILS! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/clap2.gif"/>
Generosity is giving more than you can, and pride is taking less than you need.

</quote>

What am I "taking" by getting to keep more of my own money I earned? Selfish is demanding gov't pay for your programs, even when ppl don't want to.

Generosity is voluntarily giving money on your own free will, robbery is taking money and giving to others against their will. Seems pretty common sense to me.
