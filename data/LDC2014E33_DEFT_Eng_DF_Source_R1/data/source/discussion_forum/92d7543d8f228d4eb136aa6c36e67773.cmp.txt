Shirley Sherrod, we now know that her video was edited, yet it was played on Fox again and again. And when poor Shirley was forced to resign, Fox comes out with a report, just tonight, that Obama threw an "innocent" woman under the bus. Now, Fox says she's innocent. Only now.
What video? What report?

Then there's James OKeefe and Acorn. A single Republican, able to bring down an organization that helped the poor, from spliced together video tapes. Well, he is getting sued. But, "he did it". Now all those poor people are a little more poor.
WTF are you talking about?

Then there were Republican leaders privately telling Obama that they would work with him and then publicly, saying they would do everything they could to bring him down (they called it "Waterloo"). And they did. And poor Obama believed them time and time again. I wonder if he believes them now?
"They" who? Which Republican leaders?

There was Iraq. That was because of WMDs, no, because of yellow-cake, no, it was to bring "freedom", no, it was.....
How many years back are we going to go here?

There was the 2.4 trillion dollar tax cut. Supposed to bring jobs. And it did. It brought them to China and India and even Mexico.
Still looking backwards?

Then there was April 16th 2008, Healthcare Decisions Day, proclaimed by the former Gov. of Alaska, Sarah Palin. In fact, it was such a good idea, that Democrats used the SAME legislation in the Health Care Bill. Only Sarah stopped calling it, "Healthcare Decisions Day", no, instead she called it "death panels" and "kill grandma". Another fast one.
Never heard of it..... Link?

And this unemployment bill? Stripped of everything that would help the economy. Now Republicans say, "Where's the roads being built? Where's the dam's being restored? Where's the bridges being fixed?" Well, they should know. They forced Democrats into removing them from any legislation.
Roads, dams, and bridges were supposed to be paid for with the failed Stimulus package, not the 'unemployment bill'.

Imagine if Republicans put all the sneakiness into helping the middle class. Into actually rebuilding the country. Into being on the side of regular Americans. Yea, imagine that.

I'm not making a case for anything. Just stated a fact, which I note you brilliantly ignored. Population control has been a topic for deep discussion for many, many decades and I really don't lose much sleep wondering whether or not someones dissertation on the subject will become a reality anytime soon. Because I know it won't. And so does Erlich.

1. Your post is an absurd conflation. Since the 'science czar' of the left believed we should poison 'excess' population, you seem to feel it necessary, defensive, to claim that there is any resonance on the right.

a. School of population control is know as eugenics, and well known to be a part of the constellation of inhumanities sought by the progressives.
b. I'm sure you have read 'The Population Bomb." Why would you say that Ehrlich was unconcerned about control of same?

I was being kind to you to ignore the parviscience of your post.

2. I have not formed a comprehensive opinon on immigration, so I do not post on the subject.

Translation: I have not yet researched my vast repertoire of right-wing information regarding immigration control in order to post carefully selected opinions of others with which to make my own case on the subject.

Maybe tomorrow, PC? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

I think that unless you can point to any untruths on my part, you should accept what I say about my personal motivations.

If and when I can find a comprehensive immigration policy with which I can agree, I will post it and champion it. I give a great deal of thought to my positions.

BTW, to state that my perspective is right wing requires not much prescience...nor do I consider same either intimidating nor pejorative.
