Document 33: "Magic"  Diplomatic Summary, War Department, Office of Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2, No. 1210  July 17, 1945, Top Secret Ultra
Source: Record Group 457, Records of the National Security Agency/Central Security Service, "Magic" Diplomatic Summaries 1942-1945, box 18.

Another intercept of a cable from Togo to Sato shows that the Foreign Minister rejected unconditional surrender and that the emperor was not asking the Russians mediation in anything like unconditional surrender. Incidentally, this Magic Diplomatic Summary indicates the broad scope and capabilities of the program; for example, it includes translations of intercepted French messages (see pages 8-9).

NO unconditional Surrender allowed.

Do you think you're somehow disproving, or even arguing, with what I said?

They were never willing to surrender unconditionally, I made that quite clear.

They were however willing to surrender with the sole condition that the Emperor retain his throne, we refused that sole condition, dropped two atomic bombs on their cities, and then allowed the Emperor to retain his throne anyway.

That is a lie, they demanded 4 conditions. After the second bomb and the Soviet attack the Emperor changed it to one condition. Prior to the Atomic bombs they only offered a cease fire and return to Dec 1941 borders.

I was fully prepared for you to try and jump on that and had Leahy's quote from his book ready to use in response. What you fail to understand is his prediction that it would not go off has absolutely nothing to do with the fact he said the bombs were not necessary. Quentin already posted Leahy's quote so I don't need to.

So will you respond to the fact our top military leaders all agreed the bombs were not necessary or will you continue to be dishonest and claim I'm citing sources I've not cited?

Wait....aren't you the same person that had no idea of the significance the bombs had with Russia? Do you know what else happened on August 9th, 1945?

First thing. The Atomic Bombs were not ready until Summer 1945. Germany surrendered in April. We had no reason to drop said bombs on Germany.

The reality is that it took BOTH bombs to get the Emperor of Japan to over ride his Army Controlled Government and order an immediate surrender. With those bombs we would have starved Japan through the winter killing untold thousands followed by an Invasion of a Home Island which would have seen MILLIONS of dead Japanese civilians and soldiers.

Japan was teaching her civilians to arm themselves with Bamboo spears and human wave charge any invasion. The continued invasion of Japan could have seen the potential elimination of the Japanese race.

The lie that Japan was ready to surrender is revisionist history. Japan under the Army had no intention of surrender. What they "offered" through the Soviet Union was a cease fire with Japan keeping everything she still possessed and the return of Japanese home possessions like Saipan and Okinawa. Japan was offering to let us just stop attacking them. They would retain all of their Chinese, Korean and other possessions and we would return their home island captures.

Here is a link to SOURCE documents verifying that Japan was NOT offering a meaningful surrender, that even after two atomic Bombs the Army controlled government refused to surrender, that the Emperor failed to act until after the second atomic bomb and that the Army attempted a Coup to prevent the Emperor from surrendering.

The atomic bombs were necessary unless one thinks we should have just let Japan keep everything from before the war and not disarm. They SAVED millions of lives.

From everything I've read, and talking with people at my Grandpop's lodge, this is the version I believe. I think the Truman Administration did the right thing to save American lives as terrifying as it was.
