A company that hires through a temp service.

A temp service always has 2 customers, at least.

One to bring people in for the pay.
And one that just sucks that almost no one will take.

When the big payer ends, the temp co can offer the worker the shitty job, hoping they won't take it, so it's a voluntary quit and thus no UE&gt;

Actually, as an owner of a temporary placement agency (we are a business planning and human resources solutions firm in the NYC area), it does not actually work that way. We can not offer a temp a lower salary and then deny him/her unemployment if he/she rejects the assignment. It willbe a valid rebuttle and we would lose.

Furthermore, we would never want to alienate a good tempoorary employee with such an act. Maybe some of the smaller shops that try to maximize revenue at the cost of quality service do...but as someone in the industry for over two decades, 75% of that time as an owner, that is only successful for the short term. For your inventory (temps) is at a constant and constantly rotating in and out. You need to grow inventory to grow revenue.

What many people dont realize is we value our temps as much as we value our clients. We must perform superior customer service for all of them.

Then you are the only one, or the laws in PA are different.

I dont know if the laws are different.
But the unemployment rep has the authority to apporve or denyt unemployment. It is not black and white. Conditions, circumstances, outside forces are considered...and there is always sympathy for the one making the claim.
The only people we deny unemployment to are ones that refuse to take an assignemnt at their rate three times in a row. And we document every event.

Low cost loans, credit not a problem. Try thinking beyond that. Add state government increasing funding to buy votes. One Result is higher tuition. But those teachers deserve all that money and perks on the tax payer dime right?

</quote>

Yep.

People are just standing in lines waitin' to become teachers. Hoo boy. And cab drivers too! Although I think cab drivers pay slightly better.

Just say, the topic is beyond your understanding and its all good.

Great move having government take over loans and reduce the payment. You will be paying longer and more interest. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_clap.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_clap.gif"/>

Beyond my understanding? My mom just retired. She was a teacher. She started out with shit pay..long hours and lots of long nights. She had to get her masters.

That and I've had a few friends that were college professors. One guy did it during his time searching for another radio producer gig. He taught one class and was done. Shit pay..

So yeah..I have first hand experience with it.

they have in place in most companies cutters and slashers.

This only works for a few years.

They cut and slash their way in a bloated system to profits.

At some point there is no more fat to cut.

The corps will settle for profit any way its made.

When slash and burn is done you have to make profits some way.

At the point that they need to hire to make more profits they will hire.

No republican tricks like trashing the debt ceiling or refusing tax cuts to the middle (EVEN while they claim they are all about tax cuts ) will stop the corps from finding profits.

Unfortunately for the right we have about hit the point where to make more profits the corps are going to have to hire.

While the republicans will do ANYTHING for corporations you see the corporations are not as devoted to the republicans.

They will not hold back jsut to help you get elected if there are profits to be made.

You serve a disloyal mistress cons.

Who would have thought that TM was a Captain of Industry!?

"we have about hit the point where to make more profits the corps are going to have to hire."

We have, "Hit the point?"

What "point" would that be?

I thought the only way to Save An Economy was to raise taxes. and allow government to "create" jobs using a Massive Stimulous Package?
