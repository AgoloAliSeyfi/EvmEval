Let me put it this way: if the Tea Party had become as popular movement as the OWS has (not even close), would the movement have attracted the same kind of law-breakers we see at these OWS protests? The answer is absolutely.

the tea party elected representatives, have a Congressional caucus and impacted the legislative process so much it prevented the dem agenda

ows has only broken laws

And yet, polls show that most Americans do not support Tea Party ideas. In fact, more people support the message of the OWS movement than they do the message of the Tea Party. What upsets most Americans about the OWS movement is the crime and over-night occupation. The OWS message itself, however, is something they support.

Stop making sense.

The right-wing neocon whackjobs on this board only care about the small percentage that seemingly cause trouble.

They love Wall St's unfettered love of greed and capitalism. Accountability is something that happens in a CPA's office, not on Wall St. Don't you know that Wall St is responsible for creating all those jobs out there. Even when they create nothing, but just take massive fees for doing nothing, or, in the case of some CEO's get their 'rightful' hands on those multi-million dollar bonuses even if the stock tanks and the company makes a loss.

You know why?

Because most of them are like John Gotti - only in the sense they should have the moniker Teflon in front of their names - because nothing is ever their fault and nothing ever sticks.

Stock tanked? "Not my fault that the economy's going under. Didnt' see that coming. You want me to involve my lawyers if you don't pay me my bonus? Think of the bad publicity. NOT MY FAULT"

That's how they think. And the biggest irony here is, that all these neocon loons on this board that support them harp on about personal responsibility ALL the time - except when it comes to Wall St apparently. 'Cause it seems that because they create "all these jobs", they are somehow entitled to a free pass.

You are doing exactly what you criticize others for. You don't want OWS labeled for the actions of the few.... and yet that is exactly what you do.

Hypocrisy is funny though.
