Of course Bill Kristol thinks that it's much to do about nothing. So he bashes the coverage. He doesn't get it.

Kristol is partially correct, although probably not in the way he thinks.

The thing about this case that has turned it into such a big story is that it is something different to everyone. To some it about racial profiling. To some it is police sweeping it under the rug. To some it is about the SYG law. To some it is about concealed carry. And the list goes on. Some see it merely as a crime.

Those on the right who hold different views don't have just one view either. Take what Scarborough said just the other day. He claimed it was NOT about SYG. Kristol says the opposite.

What first made this a national case was that the police were not adequately investigating and were openly defending Zimmerman. The injustice of that drew everyone in. Kristol gets that part right.. Where he goes wrong is in his assessment of the continued coverage. It is far more complex than what he tries to claim.

Part of the continued attention is countering the kneejerk claims of people who defended Zimmerman. For example, the faIse photos of Martin became an entire subset of stories. The police station video became a big story because it countered all of the claims of Zimmerman being severeIy beaten. Another aspect of the continued coverage is due to the genuine puzzlement that Zimmerman still remains uncharged in a situation where most people would have been charged.

The slow trickling of information is another aspect that keeps this going. It took weeks to get the 911 calls and even longer to get the police station video. Various other information, such as police reports, came out at other times. Much of the information was due to independent investigation (that the police should have done) and thus came out as soon as it was available. All of this plays into the 24 hour news cycle.

So, what we have is an emotional case that means something different to everyone, and a situation (brought on mostly by the police) where information is discovered in a way that perpetuates the story.

Wow I dont watch FoxNews all day, but I turned it there and they had the story on. Look just because Fox NEws doesnt bend over for democrats and Obama doesnt mean they are anywhere as right as the main media is left.
Stop with the talking points. Instead of bashing FoxNews, who doesnt edit 911 tape to change the story, light rockets under gas tanks to get trucks to explode, tout false documents as real, hire just democrats, fire john stossel just because he wasnt a liberal anymore. I could go on, but I think you get the point, those are some of the things off the top of my head that our "objective" media have done, funny how none of those "errors" favor the right, hmmmmmm
