I read a great article in Time a while back that made essentially the same argument of why high gas prices are not necessarily a bad thing for us long-term and I do agree.

For all the people saying that lots of areas have no public transport, etc, I think that is exactly the point. The REASON public transportation options are dismally inadequate in the U.S. is because we've always been spoiled with low gas prices. Look at how high gas prices have always been in Europe and then look at how their public transit sytems blow ours out of the water. It's not coincidence.

In the short-term, yes, it sucks for a lot of people who don't have viable public transit options and who also can't just up and move. I don't think many people would dispute that. But the hope is that higher prices could slowly, over time, incentivize us as a nation to start moving in the right direction.

It would more than just "suck" in the short-term; it could potentially be disastrous to our economy. More people would lose their jobs, more people would foreclose on homes they can't sell to move closer to their jobs, prices on everything from groceries on up would increase further plunging folks into poverty. Not everyone can afford to live in a city center to be closer to their jobs. With the housing market still depressed, there are many people that wouldn't be able to move anyway. An upward push on gas prices would only exacerbate these problems. We'd essentially experience a large downward spiral in terms of our economy and it could take a very long time to correct that.

While I agree with what you're saying in the long-term, what would you propose the nation do in the short-term?

Low population areas do not have suffiecient population to support public transportation and need to be subsidized to even exist at all.

I don't think there is a whole lot that we can do in the short-term. Our way of living has been decades and decades in the making and it will take decades to address this problem. But there's never been any attempt to address a lot of these issues when gas has been dirt cheap. It's going to have to be forced on us out of necessity. Is it fair that the people who suffer the most from high gas prices are not the ones that had a hand in making things the way they are today? No, it's not, but it's the way it is...generations of people can thrive or suffer based on decisions of the generations that came before them.

These areas are already heavily subsidized in regard to the cost of the infrastructure and maintenance of public services to these outlying areas. This is one of the major issues contributing to this complex problem. If you oppose subsidizing public transport in these areas, do you also oppose the funding of their general infrastructure and services? The insufficient population you refer to is the same for both.
