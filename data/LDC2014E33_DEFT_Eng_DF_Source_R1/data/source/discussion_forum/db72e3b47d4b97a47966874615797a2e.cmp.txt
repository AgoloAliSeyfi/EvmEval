I don't mind European, North America and Austral-asian immigration, but I'm completely and utterly with this woman when it comes to immigration from Africa, the Middle-East and Asia, with the exception of highly qualified people who can demonstrate that they don't hold an allegiance to their backwards cultures.

I too am disgusted when I'm on a the tube or the train and look around to see nothing but Africans and Asians surrounding me, usually with countless children surrounding them, and clearly not working and living on our country's welfare system.

We have enough scum of our own without importing more of it. If we're going to import anything it should be talent, qualification, entrepreneurialism.

Controversial, and expect a ton of neg for this, but slightly agree. For people to be allowed into our country, with record unemployment, they should have to have either something to offer by being skilled or smart, or actually be from a war torn place, not just say they are. And have to speak English

WHAT!

So, challenging a person who demeans and belittles Asian nations makes me a man who hates the West?

So pointing out that Asian nations were occupied and exploited by colonial empires makes me a man who hates the West?

So highlighting the fact that upcoming superpowers are developing along a model that does not necessitate the enslavement and exploitation of other people makes me a man who hates the West?

HAHAHA.

Just who the hell are you to accuse me of such a thing?

And for the record, infrastructure built by the British in India was done to facilitate the exporting of raw materials from India to Britain. It's no coincidence that most colonial infrastructure was concentrated around port cities (Mumbai, Cochin) and centers of administration (Delhi, Kolkata). Ports, railways were built for the movement of material. Where were the hospitals, schools, factories? What about roads in rural India? If your argument of Britain building infrastructure for the benefit of Indians is true, why is it that after 200+ years of British rule was India not one of the leading industrial nations, instead of the second poorest nation in the world at independence?

Indian industry was dismantled by the British along with its education system by leveraging high property taxes that the Indians could not afford to pay. At the same time Indians were forced to grow cash crops such as cotton, which were price-fixed (at a lower value) by the British and exported to Britain to be manufactured into goods sold at a higher price. Just one of several ways Britain grew its wealth at the expense of India.

Do not even try and justify British rule in India from your position of ignorance. You clearly know little of the subject and are relying on common or high school-learned knowledge.

My posts are not my opinion. They are facts I have gleaned from reading extensively on the subject. Quoting history does not make me anti-West. It is simply a case that you cannot accept the truth or authenticity of my arguments and are thus being defensive by trying to invalidate my posts and demonise me as anti-western.

Well, if your simple mind cannot discuss this intelligently, then do not bother me again with your foolish assumptions.

The fact that you constantly resort to using ad hominem attacks against both me and others users says all I need to know about your mind.

The Chinese are also improving the infrastructure for the sole purpose of increase the rate at which they exploit Africa's resources, so again either admit they as bad as each other or admit you don't like the West. Most countries did terrible things at that point in time, to be honest the Brits were one of the more economically free nations whic allowed people to make money if they were able to.

They look and sound different to me, but it's hard to tell with the angle the second video is taken at. I don't really think it matters whether the videos are of the same person or different people; one is bad enough, IMO... <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/dontknow.gif" alt=":dontknow:"/>

Wrong. Perhaps you could enlighten me as to the specifics regarding the ''better methods of farming and economic models'' the British introduced? Many of the poorer farmers could not afford to grow food crops due to a combination of high tax on these goods and low prices fixed by British policy. Instead Indian farmers were forced to grow cash crops such as cotton and rubber which again were price-fixed but would fetch them enough money to feed themselves, while providing cheap raw materials for export to British factories.

Example: When the American civil war broke out and cotton could not be bought from the CSA for fear of riling the Union, where did the world's cotton come from, yes Britain, by way of India. Where did the profits go? Britain, not India.

My goodness, your arguments are so simplistic. You clearly do not know what you are talking about.

Look at the population booms the nations under colonial rule experienced, they were due to better methods fo farming.

Only on TSR would this get negged.

I think what you meant to say was: "She's entitled to her own opinion (so long as it's the same as mine)."
