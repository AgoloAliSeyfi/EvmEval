We do it all the time here...I watched the whole clip of him not really answering it, and giving King shit for it.

If there was more, feel free to provide said evidence and we can go from thier.

He didnt answer the question, he just blasted King and the media ( which was his answer). Im not sure where you are going with this and how you are reading my " he didnt answer the question".

He answered it with a dodge.

Yo...

he reacted to the question....and then he answered the question.

Yet the media that deemed it appropriate for the question to be asked did not feel the public warranted knowing his answer.

I willnot provide you a clip. I dont need to. You want to assume you are correct....go for it....live in your ignorance.

I love it.

Ah cute spin.....And lovely punt.....

You claimed he answered it, so it falls on you to provide proof. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

You won't, i win.

He answered the question, numbnuts. The answer was her allegation was false. He offered evidence and the networks ignored it.
Or did you miss that part?

It was a "when did you stop beating your wife" question. He handled it very well.

Of COURSE the media is in the bag for Gingrich. They would LOVE to see him represent the GOP. Easy target, lots of baggage, a verbal gaffe just waiting to happen. The only thing better than Gingrich would be Gingrich/Palin. Holy crap, they'd think they had died and gone to heaven.

You are aware that the Obama team are afraid of Newt getting the nomination aren't you. In debates, Newt will kick Obama's pseudo-intellectual butt up one side of the stage and down the other. After all, all Obama has to run on is his dismal record and that alone has him pissing his pants.

The media is on Romney's side.... Newt stings them back.

Actually, the media is on Obama's side.

Yes, they are, but they are wanting a Romney, Obama ticket, for the very reason that many conservatives despise Romney

I pay the media no mind when I am voting anyways.

If the media is in the bag for Newt, then it is possible that CNN set up the question so Newt can answer in a forcible way. Forcible enough to send undecided republicans into his corner for the South Carolina primary.

I have called Newt a sabotuer for the Dem's, and the 'handling' of the debate by Newt appeared staged to me. If the liberal media was against Newt, they would have taken into account how Newt performed against the moderator in past debates. The moderators normally would not ask the question right off the bat(which King has done) but knife Newt through his opponents like in previous debates so that Newt could not answer directly.

All Newt did was verbally body-slam a liberal. That is how a Newt won S.C. In that case, Hannity should run for President!

What makes you think John King is a Liberal? Or were you not thinking?

</quote>

Oh my fault. It is better to say that Newt verbally body-slammed CNN, a media outlet held to be liberally biased by many republicans. That is how a Newt won S.C. In that case, Hannity should run for President!

Now is there a problem?

Sarah Palin is held to be a moron by many Democrats. Does that make it true?
