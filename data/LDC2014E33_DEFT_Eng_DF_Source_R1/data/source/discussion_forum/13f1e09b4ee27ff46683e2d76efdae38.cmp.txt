That's not true, either. I saved up for it because I knew I was going to need it. A rule of thumb is to keep three months set aside in case all goes wrong (maybe six would be better). Has nothing to do with wealth...just common sense and planning ahead. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_angel.gif"/>

Six months is the minimum recommended by Financial Planners. Unfortunately, when you are raising a family that is not so easy to do. In fact, it is about as possible as affording COBRA.

So, you think taking the availability of plans (coverages/deductibles/costs/prescription plans etc.) and dropping it down to one is more options?

the rich don't need cobra, they can buy their own individual policy at any price...so to continue insurance.

the poor don't need cobra to continue being insured, they never were insured by their employers, they have medicaid.

Cobra is for the middle to upper middle, who can not afford the price of an individual plan, as the wealthy can...

the middle and the lower middle won't be able to afford it, but in many states, they help fund your cobra via means testing while collecting UE that does help the middle, lower middle....

Guess, what the lower middle to middle class already cannot afford it. That has been the entire discussion. The only people that can afford it are the super rich... that is why it sucks.

yes, they can NOT afford it Immie..COBRA was never meant to be affordable for the masses....it was meant to keep ones coverage going, if they were sick or a family member was sick....the $700-1000 a month is outrageous, but it is still BETTER than the $2500 a month that it would cost you for your family if you had to buy insurance as an individual without the group rate and....

thus the need for health care insurance reform...the reform that you are fighting against....

I personally have no problems if we ever went to a single payer plan, with doctors and hospitals still in the private sector.... My personal experience with the insurance companies HAS NOT BEEN GOOD and if i never have to deal with them again, I would be a happy person....maybe other people have had better experiences, but I haven't....and I can only go on my own experience.

Care, single payer doesn't mean doctors and hospitals aren't in the private sector. It only means that insurance would be structured like Medicare...Medicare is an insurance plan, not an employer of doctors.

why you rail against your inner nature is pretty strange...and funny.

</quote>

I do no such thing, I rail against the men and women, we as a nation have relinquished our nation to. They cannot be trusted and unfortunately, the life path they have embarked upon leads to corruption. I don't blame them for that fact, but they all fall into that path.

IMO, life in general would be easier and more productive if we didn't have to worry about health insurance.

Read up, I said the same thing earlier.

<quote>
You've STILL not addressed the fact that we already pay for 46% of Americans through taxes. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/doubt.gif"/>

</quote>

Because, it doesn't matter to me... 46% is a long way from full control and I am not convinced of the accuracy of the chart you showed.

Oh, I know that Ravi...I was just saying it out loud so others realize a single payer plan is not hospitals and doctors working for the government and them being on the govts payroll, as many on the right KEEP SAYING. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>
