Labeling it this way or that isn't going to hinder their attempts at preventing it next time.

And how would you prevent, apart from banning people from the Service based on Religion which is ludacrous in regard to the spirit of our Country......and being a good human being in general.

That isn't at all true.

Nidal Hasan was well KNOWN to be a nutcase. He wasn't hiding it. People noticed that he was SAYING more and more radical things. Because he was muslim, everyone was too afraid to say anything for fear they would be identified as being somehow anti muslim. We should never be afraid to be intimidated by religion to say that a muslim is a dangerous lunatic.

Ok several things going on in thios post:

-If personal individuals ignored LUNATIC talk for fear they'd somehow be labeled anti-Muslim, they're either irrational or they're cowards. They lack character and should be seen as such, as look what their cowardice has allowed to slip through the cracks. Personal Responsibility? Helloo000oo0o?

-#2: whether his crazy talk was "Terrorist," "torture and kill-ist," "Cannibalist," - doesn't matter - his intent was "to kill," killing is killing is killing, get over your fraudulant labels that serve nothing but a political end with a bloody means. Get real.

And lastly - all adults should know the difference between pointing out real lunacy, and being a bigot against a certain religion or culture. If you can't tell the difference?&gt; Go back to school. It's not "Pc crap" that's at fault, it's your supreme lack of common sense and analytical thinking skills that are at fault.

And simply because idiots lack that common sense and analytical thinking prowess, doesn't mean it should all of a sudden be A-OK to BE A BIGOT.

Low road taking assed fool.

Usually, when people say "pc crap," what they're referring to is "having respect for people."

It says something when you rail tooth and nail against that.

It's not BEING "politically correct" to ignore a Muslim guy talking crazy terror talk - - - - - - it's being RETARDED.

The difference between calling it the "WAr on Terror" and the "War on Organized Crime/murder" is n'il to me. Means absolutely dick. If it makes you sleep better, I'm all for it.

Seriously, I'm genuinely astonished that anyone can agree with the official, carpet sweeping description of what happened at Ft. Hood. It was a terrorist attack co-ordinated by an Islamic fundamentalist. And how is the targeting of personel with a firearm an accident, regardless of whether or not it happened at a workplace (in this case being a military installation)?

Indeed. Perhaps the Mickey Mouse act heading the show will choke on a bullet and we'll have to chalk it up as one of those unfortunate, unavoidable accidents.

This is old news, but still an insult to those who died!

It was a terrorist attack PERIOD!

Seriously? You sure?

Death isn't death? It makes a difference to them which type of murder it was?

It certainly matters to you. Why else do you pass hate crime legislation? Hmmm?
