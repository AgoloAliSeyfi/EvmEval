As a black man, I look at Jesse as not the greatest of the Civil Rights Leaders, but a good man, and a flawed man., as we all are. I most admired him when he came out an said, hey let's not put all problems on the white man, Let's get our own act together.

Yes, booman
I see Jesse that way myself. But the conservatives will never have any charity in their hearts for him because they apparently believe he does all the African Americans' thinking for them and they seem to think that is why few of them vote Republican - Silly, but, what else could it be?

Right Edgar,
...People seem to forget, that although "life is simple,people are compicated." For instance, no matter what othes think about republicans, the scariest, and most consistant thing about them to me, is as soon as they get into office, the first thing they want to do is cut funds on education, and culture. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad"/>

You say in your signature "Ignorance is preferable to error" may I suggest you live by your code and stop making so many errors and just keep wading around in your swamp of ignorance.

From someone who thinks all indians should be dead perception, I take that as a compliment. Thank you!

I take it that blacks, chicanos, arabs, asians and jews are included in that view also. Then it would be the country the way you invisioned it.

Joanne,

Dyslexia,

I love Jesse, I have met him and I love him. I love Jesse so much I do not even bother to argue about whether he is right or wrong. I know where he stand on most issues and at least 90% I agree with him and the other 10% I apply the my so what theory.

The so what theory was developed while I was working as a labor relations professional on the union side of the table. When ever management tried to get me to side track into frivolous argument over issues of say contract language which could only be resolved before an arbitrator or an ALJ I would just say over and over silently to myself (with an attentive look on my face of course) SO WHAT. Another good theory is the fjck you I will see ya at the hearing theory (that needs no explanation).

Yeah, I reckon thaat doesn't need any explanation. (whew)....I'll tell you something I love about Jesse. When the big-time interviewers try to trap him he has answer for everything. You can't do that unless you have solid foundation.

You can if you have a solid foundation and you are brilliant.

I was semi joking. A poster early in the thread made it sound as though were making up our own legends about 60s protest days. I meant here that we would be telling future young people about the new peace protests and might be accused similarly.

Not even close. The 60's were full of real heroes and legends that shook the world....Ahh you're pobably right, some will likely be manufactured.

the problem is that those amazing people who made the civil rights agenda happen in the 60's were not heros, they were doing simply what they thought they should be doing.

It was not I who suggested they were manufactured. I haven't looked back to see who it was made that or a similar statement. I was speaking with tongue in cheek - Whatever that is.

There have been many good guys that have helped minorities in the past. I'd like to share this story, because he is one of the heroes of America. When President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 to incarcerate all Japanese Americans living on the West Coast, Governor Carr of Colorado told the Japanese Americans we were welcome to come to his state at personal sacrifice. Needless to say, he lost the subsequent election, but about fifteen years ago, the Japanese American Community built a memorial to Governor Carr in Denver. c.i.
