@The Pentacle Queen,

I'm from the Midwest. Honestly I'll disagree with Set in that I prefer the phrase "Middle America" and that many people in Missouri where I'm from use the phrase, but that's for some other thread. :-)

Set is right though, the anti-intellectual movement is not unique to the midwest. It can be found in any part of the USA. The basics that you need to understand is that at it's root it is a means to manipulate people. The leverage is based on divisive memes targeting more rural Americans.

The most common phrase or word you'll hear used (mostly during campaigns) is "elitism." The idea here is that some new aged rich person you you (assumably) can't identify with knows better for you and thinks that they are better than you. It's an appeal to emotion.

I understand how it works though. I live out east now in the DC area and the attitude towards Midwestern states is terrible here. Same goes for California. Midwesterners feel culturally marginalized and less valued as citizens. These feelings are exploited and used to build resentment towards coastal and more specifically urban citizens; democrats.

Want to condemn gay under the guise of honorable principles? Appeal to the idea that those intellectuals are stomping on our rich tradition and culture.

Want to get evolution out of our schools? Make it seem like those intellectuals are just full of themselves. They aren't smarter than me!

PQ - Honestly I'm better off from experiencing it firsthand in my life. It's just a tool to manipulate people. I understand its potency. After meeting some of the most brilliant people in my life while being in the Midwest, I do harbor resentment for the way the fly-over-food-states are culturally obscure in the USA.

Every summer as a child, I'd go visit my family in California, and I'd play with the neighborhood kids. When I'd say I was from Missouri, they'd say "I'm sorry." That kind of arrogance boiled my blood even at a young age. I think however that anger I felt helped me understand why people are so vulnerable to this kind of thing.

@Diest TKO,

If someday you find yourself touring about the USA, it's probably going to be the coastal cities you'll be interested in. I'm not sure what of the Midwest is ever positively promoted in our media culture, and exported overseas.

I'd challenge yourself to see some of the great cities and beautiful nature in the heartland. :-)

Hell, there's some A2Kers in Chicago. Great city. almost as cool as St. Louis. :-P

They knew what you meant by middle America, darlin'... but it is a term used in derision to mock the Republicans, who coined the term in an effort to suggest that the majority of Americans are conservative, and are ignored by "liberal elites." In that sense, it was a very appropriate term to have used to introduce the topic of anti-intellectualism. You can see in the threads at this site, in which someone whose political or religious points of view are ridiculed will immediately accuse their interlocutor of intellectual snobbery--basically, the "oh, you think you're so smart" type of retort. I suspect it is common to all times and all places, in one form or another.

@Setanta,

I think the general idea is the part of America far enough away from the big, more cosmopolitan and sophisticated coastal metropolitan areas -- which probably only includes Chicago in the North, but maybe excluding Portland Oregon in the West.

@Lightwizard,

I think typecasting rednecks or middle americans as anti-intellectual is a form of bigotry. It's not a geographical mind set...there are plenty of anti-intellectuals in NY city. I see it more as a class clash, the sort of thing that so much English comedy is based on.
In fact I remember an episode of "Open All Hours" that showed the grocer mistrusting an upper class toft in the same way.
