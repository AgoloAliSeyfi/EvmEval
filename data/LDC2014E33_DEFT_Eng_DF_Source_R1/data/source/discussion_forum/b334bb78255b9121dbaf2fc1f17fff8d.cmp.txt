30. So How Is This Line Item Veto Any Different

Than the one Congress passed in about 1995 that the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional? This just looks like the House wasting more time on meaningless legislation that will go nowhere.

37. In this version they are trying to get around the SC objections.

Any thing the President lines out goes back to Congress for an up or down vote. That provision was not in the 90s version and a lack of a second vote is what the SC said was unconstitutional.

31. Amend the Constitution if you want a line-item veto. This is not Constitutional.

32. It's a bad law

The congress is responsible for crafting a funding bill. If they want line-item, then separate the funding into different bills and pass them through the house and senate separately.

Then, the president can either sign or veto the bill separately.

35. Isn't this unconstitutional

If they give this power up are they not subverting the constitution, Rewriting the constitution or at least violating their oath to uphold the constitution?
