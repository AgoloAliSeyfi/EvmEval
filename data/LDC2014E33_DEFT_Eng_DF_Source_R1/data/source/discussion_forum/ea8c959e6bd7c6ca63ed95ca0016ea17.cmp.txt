This continued nonsense that the minorities [and in New York City I use that term advisedly] are being educationally short changed is just that. Nonsense! They are afforded the same education as everyone else and in fact go to the same schools. Why than is it that others can thrive and in many, too many, instances they do not. This is not a conservative statement but a statement of fact. Is it because they are mentally incapable? Of course not! They have in too many instances been sold the idea that study and good grades is a white thing. To be precise the question asked of those that do is "what are you trying to be like whitey." That is the basic problem that needs to find a cure. Until the will to learn is instilled no amount of wishful thinking and special privileges will help.
Now can someone answer my question what do we owe the flood of Hispanics flowing across our borders and those people of color newly arrived in the US? AA?

Is that enough meat to chew on?

Au -- I don't think it's a matter of color. First, I think we have sub-standard public schools, pretty much across the board. Yes, there are exceptions, but even the best and classiest rank below average European schools (for example). Second, we have society in which resources accumulate shockingly at the top and not much is left at the bottom. That means that in certain areas the schools get even less thus putting some kids in their own third-world country smack-dab in probably the richest country in the world.

You can watch TV and quote from its fictions and you are not wrong that some kids have innate capabilities greater than others -- a disparity which has no color -- but a middle-class WASP or Jewish kid with learning disabilities is much more likely to be shepherded along through a decent education while the same kid from an economic ghetto or rural area is not likely to get anything like that help. Forget about race/color. Take a look at the whole crowd of kids going through public education. Are you able to figure out before, say, fifth grade which kids are likely to graduate and go to a good college? And if so, how can you tell?

If one's parents are literate, and avid readers, one will be exposed to such influences from an early age. This does not necessarily imply a high degree of education. My grandpartents raised me, my grandmother had four years of education, my grandfather eight. Nonetheless, my grandfather taught me to read before age four, and my grandmother was a constant reader, and sufficiently familiar with "good" literature that you could get a cogent discussion out of her on the comparative merits of Dickens and Hardy. This is an obvious advantage.

What is not so obvious is that if one is descended from slaves who were legally denied education, one does not necessarily grow up in such an environment. Many black children to this day have had to find work rather than seek educational advantages. Even with the proliferation of public libraries, those of limited economic means are not necessarily going to have many books, magazines and newspapers in the home. Poverty, for whatever the cause, also often results in teen-aged mothers, and families without fathers--sufficient enough is the evil of getting a living for a houseful of children, without taking the time to teach children to read before they enter school, or indulge in deep discussions of literary meanings. Affirmative Action seeks to remedy the continuingly pernicious effects of centuries of disadvantage. Au's comments about educational and learning opportunities are shallow, to say the least.

Nice to see you again, as always. I like your Rawlsian example above. Perhaps if I have time later, I'll set up the veil of ignorance notion for au and others to look at.

Where sc and some other voices use 'what sort of community do I wish for' as a framework in thinking about social policy, au and others seem to use something like 'why should I give my hard-earned stuff to anyone else?' Part of what Rawls tried to accomplish is a bridge between those two frameworks.

Set, You touched on part of the problem of "unequal education." The reasons include what you identify as one problem of many. Another is discrimination in housing that is pervasive even today. The San Jose Mercury News had a article not long ago that discrimination in housing against black, Hispanics and Asians in Silicon Valley still exists. The ramifications from discrimination in housing has many negative impacts; one of which is "segregation by fiat." I believe this is one of the reasons (not all) why black crimes against blacks are so common in our country. I'm not a social scientist, but it seems obvious to me that living in a ghetto handicaps the children in many ways. I also believe in personal responsibility, but the circumstances from which black people are required to pull themselves out of poverty is a herculean task for any child. c.i.
