Ok Im going to reply to different people on here in one part. When I stated"retards", you all must be pot heads or you wouldnt of took offense to that, i wasnt pointing my finger at one certain person, i meant people that are like what i was saying in my previous post. Its funny how you think i was being mean and my words are needed to be more tasteful....have you people even read the ones that commented on my first post? Not only was I called names in them but as soon as i say iam against legalize of it, i get put down like everything i said was wrong. Its called a opinion, you dont like it, dont read it and ignore it. You all have your opinion, and thats fine. I will not "live through" my kids, as someone said something of the sort, to what i should of did. I was a very good teenager growing up, i had a protective mother. I didnt drink, do drugs, sneak out, sleep around. I had morals. So if my kids grow up similar to me, i have no problem. I did drink when i was 20 now and then and when I was 21 i drank alot for about 6 months. I had went through alot. Sure alcohol can damage you if you are a alcoholic, but so can other things. I HAVE seen people all messed up from drugs and weed. For someone that made a certain comment, dont tell me what i have or havnt fuckin seen. My husband's mother was a drug addict half his life, his aunts, his step-father. And they sold. He grew up never doing that, not even pot. Iam very protective of my children cause i know the kind of people out there, i wont let my mother in law take them by herself cause i dont know what she will be doing at her home with my kids around. Even though they are supposedly not doing anything. Iam NOT naive, nor sheltered. To someone who was 18 and said they knew more or something like that...get real. I have been through a hell of alot with certain things and you will never know what i know or am educated about. Iam not going to tell my kids its bad for you and thats that. I will tell them why and educate them on it. They will be the ones to make thier own decisions in life, and hopefully they are the right ones. My kids will be good kids though, iam not a parent that lets them do whatever they want and not be there for them. They are thier own person and iam there just to guide them. They might be angels they might not, but i got 4 of them i raise, so i know alot more about kids then some of you. Iam not a idiot, get the fuck off your high pedastal....now that dear was rude. All of you that are commenting on my post are taking this personally, and you must be pot heads or something cause you wouldnt give a shit, its ridiculous. Iam not naming one person out, iam saying certain people, and its all my opinion. If you dont like it, then you dont have to respond. Iam against it, thats all. nothing more to be said.

I am going to address one point, and one point only. If you had not been insulting in your original response, I probably wouldn't have even responded to you. I know that people disagree with my stance, and I respect that. But people tend to get defensive if you insult them. Don't insult me and I will treat you with respect. Call me a low life bum, and I have lost all respect for you.
