Madeline,

To whatever weight you give USMB-ers, I hope I can add my two cents and experience.

I was a research assistant for 15 months with the <a href="http://american.edu/cas/history/institutes/nuclear-studies.cfm">Nuclear Studies Institute</a>, in my capacity as a researcher compiling documents, quotes, sources, etc. for peer-reviewed articles and a book, I pored over several hundred and probably thousands of official documents from the time the bomb was dropped. I think it's fair to call myself an expert on the subject and I was mentored by one of the nation's foremost scholars on the subject..

Yes, Madeline, I suggest you actually go to the sources of these claims and see what the articles REALLY say, rather than relying on half-quotes.

Curvelight's "source" is Mark Weber's IHR Article.

Let's see what Good Ol' Mark is all about, shall we?

Ahh, yes.

Only those as hopelessly stupid as Curvey would use Weber as a resource. Maybe he has a National Enquirer Article he'd like to present with more credability? Perhaps some Alien in the form of Elvis has an opinion about Ethics and The A-Bomb that Curvey would like to share!! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Well CurveLight? Is this true? You've relied on reporting by a discredited man?

This is the last time I respond when you rely on another poster to state my source instead of asking me directly or ignoring the fact I've pointed to the same article at least three times:

"Walter Trohan, JAPS ASKED PEACE IN JAN. ENVOYS ON WAY  TOKYO Chicago Tribune, August 19, 1945."

Once again they did not offer pe4ace. READ the Japanese Government meetings. They offered to just stop the war with no other consequence to them.
