I disagree. I think Katrina made him fall.

See? Here's more proof my thread is correct. This righty says it was Katrina, not the MORE THAN DOUBLING OF THE NATIONAL DEBT that caused Bush to be a failure.

Is Article a righty? Just how far left are you?

I wasn't re-writing anything.....There were a lot of people making lots of noise about the excessive spending, and not all of it was coming from the leftist wacko fringe.

The Bushbots were 25%-ers.

But no tea parties. No news stories. No one really concerned about it, until now. You might consider Beck to be a lot of people, but not really that many people pay any attention to that psycho.

</quote>

His ratings don't match that claim.

</quote>

Yes they do. There are 310 million people in the USA.

How many watch Beck? 1%?

taxes were cut on middle class, low class, upper class, AND capital gains.

Only if middle and low class people make their money on dividends and selling stocks for a profit.

LOL!!!!!

I'm pretty sure not many do.

I'm pretty sure it's the yacht sailing, pool sitting, cigar smoking fat cats watching the checks come in who enjoyed the Bush tax cuts that will expire this year.

</quote>

still haven't looked at what I posted, eh? those expirations are going to cost me 3000 dollars. 3 thousand dollars.

</quote>

You know, I don't understand why anyone is having trouble with this. In 2000, BEFORE the Bush tax cuts, the 28% tax rate kicked in at an INCOME of $26,250. In 2009, AFTER the Bush tax cuts, the 28% tax rate kicks in at an INCOME level of more than $82,000.

Nah. Ali is one of those few people you'll ever see. He knew he was the greatest and not only did he walk the walk but he talked the talk.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxczlps5_bg">YouTube - Great speeches - Muhammad ali - I am the Greatest</a>

If there was a boxer today with even half the personality of Ali, Boxing would be a lot more popular.

I think your leather thong is about 5 sizes too small and it's cutting off the circulation to your brain.

Hell, Obama makes Clintoon look like Goldwater.

Not easy to find something to comment on in your post filled with nonsense, but there's one part that stands out.

Clinton left us with a budget surplus.

and what is Obama going to leave us with?

Some CD's?

A growing economy.

It's already growing in the last 3 quarters after falling for like 6 quarters previous.

Chevron, which is the second largest oil company behind Exxon, managed to earn about $43 billion for the year. Other, smaller oil companies are struggling a bit more than their larger competitors, with even Royal Dutch Shell recording its first quarterly loss in a decade. 2009 is shaping up to continue the trend of lowered profits.
