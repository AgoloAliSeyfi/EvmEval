"...it is not guaranteed..."

That isn't what they said, you are extrapolating that.

Here is the Q&amp;A you referenced: Q: What happens on August 3 if the debt limit is not increased?

A:  Using August 2010 spending and receipts as a proxy, the Treasury will probably take in $5-$10 bn in revenue on August 3, leaving insufficient revenues to make Social Security payments partly unfunded even if all other spending is deferred. Since the Treasury has carried a minimum cash balance of about $20 bn since 2009, and currently carries a balance of $74 bn, Social Security payments might still be made by drawing down the Treasurys cash balance.

Q: Are Treasury interest payments at risk?

A: We do not think so.  There are two basic reasons that interest payments should not be called into question: First, if the August 2 deadline is missed, it is very difficult to see the debate dragging to August 15, when interest payments are made, since we doubt there will much congressional appetite for a protracted lapse in borrowing authority.  Second, the Treasury is likely to prioritize payments. While the sharp fiscal contraction that would result from prioritization would have negative short-term economic consequences and would be difficult to implement, it nevertheless seems likely if necessary.

Q: If other non-interest payments are missed, would that constitute a default?

A: Probably not, at least from the rating agency perspective. The rating agencies have not been entirely clear on this point, but S&amp;P, Moodys, and Fitch all appear to view a failure to pay other obligations to be different from a default. S&amp;P has already put the US on negative outlook due to longer-term fiscal issues, and the other two rating agencies have indicated they will move to a negative outlook if no agreement is reached by August 2.

Actually, Belk, I left out the part where it is the Tralfamadorian Overlords secretly beaming mind control rays into Keith Olberman's head which are transmitted nightly on his show into all 93,000 of his viewers who then immediatley go out and "convert" anyone they can find. I mean, it stands to reason they got to the guy who asked Obama the question, doesn't it?

Well why didn't you say so? That makes perfect sense since it is an obvious counter to the Klezborkians control of Glenn beck watchers. Now we just need to figure out who is behind the Jon Stewart craze so we can stop the Illuminati world domination. <img src="http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/kawaii.gif"/>

Nor did I claim it did. It doesn't say "not guaranteed" either. That was my point.

Wait, I am receiving a message from Star Fleet Command.....

Then why did you bother commenting on my post which stated

Can you prove that the checks Obama mentioned can be guaranteed to be sent out after the country goes into default?

Apparently, your answer is no, you cannot prove that the checks Obama mentioned can be guaranteed to be sent out after the country goes into default
