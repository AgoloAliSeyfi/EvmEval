The key to Rush's apology is do we look at him as saying "it was the wrong thing to say and I won't do it again" or " I am sorry the reaction was so hard against me"????

By her behavior Fluke proved the absolute truth of what he said. She wants birth control coverage to the tune of $1,000 a year. As has been ABUNDANTLY made clear, to use that much BC, she has to be having sex so often that it's a wonder how she is getting through school. But that's a matter between the school and the professors.

Are you honestly too stupid to understand that the amount of birth control pills a woman uses has no relationship whatsoever to the frequency of intercourse she has.

ARE YOU HONESTLY THAT STUPID, or are you simply padding your reputation as a USMB troll?

</quote>

Can't you just admit that the cost of birth control pills doesn't come close to the money she claims she requires to support her sex addiction? Are you deliberately stupid, or just trying to obfuscate just this one time. If all she needs are birth control pills, that doesn't come CLOSE to the $1,000 she claims she needs? No one wants to deny her birth control and disease control for this woman is a public health matter (which is why so many clinics give out free condoms) she just has to either pay for it, or extend herself far enough to get it free like the street whores do.

I don't know how much they cost. I don't take them. She may have been on the high end, but then I read this:

<quote>
In reality, oral contraceptives or “The Pill” range between $35 and $250 for the initial provider visit and the cost of a monthly supply of pills ranges between $15 and $50 a month, which amounts to between $180 and $600 a year depending on woman’s medical coverage.

This means some women without insurance coverage for contraception may pay over $850 the first year of their prescription. Other forms of birth control are far more expensive. For instance, the cost for a monthly supply of birth control patches ranges from $15 to $80 dollars, or between $180 and $960 a year. Combined with the doctors visit, uninsured women could spend over $1,200 dollars in the first year.

I do think she said up to. For some, I've no doubt it cost that much. For others, less. Nonetheless, a prescription should be something that should be covered in the policy for which she contributes premiums.

He's not sorry for what he did, he's sorry he got caught.

That still doesn't paper over the fact, katzdoggie - you think birth control pills are like rubbers, apparently - I guess in your mind, you take one every time you have sex. Which is freakin hilarious.

He apologized?

Oh man..that must have been serious.

</quote>

If you want to call that an apology. I wouldn't.

According to her, she's a slut. He just put the right term to it. Are you saying she's not a slut, she's a liar?

Re: His half-assed apology:

<quote>
Here’s that section of <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entries/rush-limbaugh-apologizes-to-sandra-fluke">Limbaugh’s statement</a> : I think it is absolutely absurd that during these very serious political times, we are discussing personal sexual recreational activities before members of Congress. I personally do not agree that <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/PaulBegala/status/176074942889209856">American</a> citizens should pay for these social activities. What happened to personal responsibility and accountability? Where do we draw the line? If this is accepted as the norm, what will follow? Will we be debating if taxpayers should pay for new sneakers for all students that are interested in running to keep fit? In my monologue, I posited that it is not our business whatsoever to know what is going on in anyone’s bedroom nor do I think it is a topic that should reach a presidential level. “In ‘apology,’ Rush compares birth control &amp; women’s health to govt buying sneakers for workouts. Insulting? ” <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/PaulBegala/status/176072747552743424">tweeted</a> Paul Begala, an adviser to the super PAC supporting President Obama. “Read Rush’s full statement. You tell me if it is contrition or continued derision toward women,” he also wrote.
