Palimony suits do not take you to the cleaners. The two are different.

Unlike alimony, palimony settlements usually involve a lump sum paid at once, versus permanent monthly payments. A further difference is that palimony does not divide "common assets." In a palimony suit, the legal owner of any assets gets those assets without question, even if the partner has paid into them and considers them common property.

You can get fleeced with a palimony suit just as readily as a divorce.

Why are you automatically assuming that marriage will end in divorce? I've been in a monogamous relationship with my life partner for over 16 years now. Why isn't our relationship deserving of the same rights, benefits, privileges and protections of legal civil marriage that is granted heterosexual couples?

Got anything that WILL stand up in a court of law as a reason to deny me this equality?

I am not assuming, the statistic's say that there is a very large number of marriages end in divorce whether it be straight or Gay's.
I also said that you should have the same rights but doing it with laws.
I also said why it harms the nation as a whole.

Couples living together. Sex without marriage.
Drug abuse, porn, sex trafficking, alcoholism and homosexuality,pedophiles and bestiality.
Whenever these type of sins become accepted by society, civilization starts to decay and fall.
All of this leads to the decline of the family unit. A husband and wife who raise their families. When things go well with the family, life is worth living, when the family falters, life falls apart.

When deadly sins like pedophiles, bestiality and homosexuality are accepted it decays the moral and spiritual values in a well ordered civilization.

Families are the foundation of a nation.

When one sin becomes more acceptable others follow.
If you get your marriage rights, what is stopping the next one, which is those that want to marry their animal sex partners. They are coming out of the closet around the world now and are speaking out about their civil rights also.

Do you think couples who are not virgins should be allowed to marry?

Isn't that a deadly sin?

Chris Christie has always said, even during his election, that if it came to his desk, he would veto a bill on gay's getting married. So it came to his desk and unbelievable, he did what he said he would do. Now Governor Christie has said that he wants the citizens of New Jersey to vote on the matter. Oh my GAWD! The audasity of this man!

Now I realize that for the left, a politician doing EXACTLY what he said he would do is unique. I mean look at Barry and his pals. The poster child for saying one thing in the campaign and doing another in reality. We could start with Barry declining public financing. We could move to 9 trillion dollars in debt being "unpatriotic", but let's not bore everyone with details. Besides the left is not big on facts.

States have the ability to define what marriage is. In Oklahoma we have a constitutional amendment that defines it as one man and one woman. Further, our state does not recognize marriages that do not conform to that definition from other states. It is a state issue and it should be. Don't like it? Then don't live there.

I also think that when Prop 8 from California gets to the Supreme Court, it's going to be bad news for those of you that want it over turned. But hey, we'll see.
