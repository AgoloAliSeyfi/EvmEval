Idiot...

Again... Jesus never called for the forced confiscation from others

Our government is not 'taking care of the sick and poor', they are throwing money at the problem... money that is being taken for forced charity

This is not some hippie commune where 'everyone is in this together'.. this is a nation based on freedoms and the protection of those freedoms.. among which is the freedom to succeed that goes hand in hand with the freedom to fail

While I whole heartedly call for people to support charities for causes that speak to them personally... in NO way should any charity or support be forced thru government and taxation... such things are exactly why we have the multi-tendrilled leviathan, hungry for power, that we have now... which is crippling our country

Charity is limited in what they can do for the poor. They always have been. In good times, they are flush with funds and do not have as many people to help. In hard times, their funding dries up and they have more people asking for help.

The Government is always there for those in need. Not just with food and shelter but with healthcare, educational support, jobs programs......things that charity does not provide

</quote>

Charity is limited by donation....

You personally don't like it if someone else does not give as much as YOU think is enough for others to equalize outcome

The government's job is NOT to ensure your every personal need is taken care of... Government's job is to protect the freedoms of all citizens so that they can succeed or fail all on their own

Sorry but we are not a Darwinistic society

Thank god we don't allow people like yourself to make decisions

Sorry... you're now owed provisions to take care of yourself, simply because you exist.. that is, unless you are a ward of the state where you are indeed stripped of your freedoms (prisoners, the mentally incompetent etc..._

And they have been paid appropriately for their labors...

If everyone on the fucking planet were not qualified to do the same exact thing, they could then probably demand more for their labor... if you do not improve yourself, what you can bring to the table in skills, etc, it is not up to society or government to make up for it

"And they have been paid appropriately for their labors..."

I think that proably our biggest problem is that that is very rarely true.
It would probably be at least as true to say that those who work the hardest are paid the least.

We are Darwinian no matter who is in charge. If it's the Democrats, only those who hew the line on global warming, racism, poverty, etc etc will get official permission to continue.
At least with conservatives people can succeed or fail on their own.

What have the poor done to deserve our support?

Don't talk to me. Talk to your "Jesus".

The only problem with your point is that you have not yet learned to distinguish between Charity and Forced Compliance. Learn to give voluntarily, from your Heart RD.

Now give me your wallet, with everything in it. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/> Give me a big smile and a hug too. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.

Giving someone some old unwanted can of creamed corn rusting in the back of the pantry hardly competes with really giving someone a chance. The "let them die" crowd doesn't get it. What cold, hard hearts and tiny minds they have. Would Jesus be proud? I doubt it.
