Thanks so much for reinforcing what I wrote.

A non-reply like this is sure-fire proof that its true.

Soggy NEVER has an actual real thought, just chimes in to let others know how wrong they are without much else.

If there's one thing the repubs/teabags HATE is when their really dumb "give the rich more money so they'll give us jobs" is proven WRONG. INCORRECT.

It hasn't happened yet and it ain't never gonna happen.

They know this. Their "leaders" know this. There isn't anyone who does not know this premise is just plain stupid.

And, posting a line of silly little smiley faces doesn't change that. Its just a way of diverting attention away from the truth of my words.

It's funny when you ask for actual examples that highlight the points they try to make. You get one of three things

1) insults
2) change of topic
3) flat out ignored

There are few cons on this site who are capable of having an adult discussion. Unfortunately I haven't seen any of them in this thread.

Income can NEVER be fair.

Person A makes $10.00 an hour and works an 8 hour day.

Person B makes $10.00 an hour for an 8 hour day, then works 4 additional hours at $15.00 an hour.

There is an AUTOMATIC inequality in income. It is already unfair to the person who only walks off with $80.00 for a day's work.

The only true "fair tax" would be a flat tax that EVERYONE had to pay... EVERYONE!

You make $10,000 a year, you pay 17%.

You make $1,000,000 a year, you pay 17%.

THAT is fair. End of story.

</quote>

Well, a flat tax may or may not be more "fair" based on the bias of the Individual determining "fair" but is that what is best for our long-term growth and prosperity?

</quote>

Fair is subjective... no matter how you look at it... someone or some group wil always claim unfair because it goes against their personal comfort or feelings or whatever...

What this country SHOULD be concerned with is equal treatment by government under law... not treating dollar X differently for person Y than how dollar A is being treated for person B...

A sales tax is equal... not bothered by personal situations.... not influenced by this voting group in particular... it is blind, and it is equal in treatment for every person and for every dollar spent... a similar system should be in place for dollars earned... with zero exceptions, zero deductions, and zero loopholes

</quote>

Our system is equal as it taxes the dollars earned, not the person. You are treated no differently than I am for the 10,000th dollar we each earn. Just like we aren't treated differently for the 1,000,000 dollar we both earn. The dollars are taxed not the person.
