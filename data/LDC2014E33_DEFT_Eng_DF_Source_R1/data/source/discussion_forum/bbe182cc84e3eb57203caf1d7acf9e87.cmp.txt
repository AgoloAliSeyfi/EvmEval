I was just about to quote this sura too. What I said isn't entirely what I was trying to say so apologies. <img src="images/smilies/tongue.png"/>

What I was meaning to say is when it comes down to it, Islamic law, or Shari'a, is constituted by four main components: Qur'an, hadith, consensus of scholars and analogy/human reasoning. Although the Qur'an does mention the whole thing about modestly and veiling, it was written in a completely different social and cultural context to current societies. The question whether to veil or not is I guess particularly pertinent to Muslim women in a 'Western' society where wearing the hijab or niqab etc. could be seen as an isolation barrier, or a metaphorical barrier between 'Islam' and the 'West'. This is where human reasoning would come into things. Shari'a can be interpreted differently and modernised with the motions of society whilst conforming to the egalitarian principles of the Qur'an (Fatima Mernessi).

Have you maybe though that she is forced to wear the hijab because otherways her retarded muslim family might go to an extrem like oh I don't know? kill her?

Seriously Islam is more or less crap but Islam in the UK? Boy oh boy that's the crappiest crap there is.

What do you know about Islam? Islam is the most rational religion in the world.
Dont get illusional with the type of Muslims you might come across with. Try to read Quran and judge Islam from it..
