The Buggery Act 1553 firstly outlawed homosexuality, making it punishable by hanging. It was only in 1861 where the death penalty was removed, and in 1967 where homosexuality was decriminalised. Homosexual couples now have the right to sexual relations, and even marriage. It's taken more than 450 years for such to take place, but such legislation is a cause for concern.

Some say that incest is love, but as adduced through our law, this is simply disgusting and a criminal offence. Some people think that polygamous marriage is acceptable as well, but again as adduced through the law, it's not ( it's illegal, unless you're married outside of the UK where it is legal).
The strong dislike of incest within the TSR community, and the examples mentioned above just prove that christian ethics still have a sound influence on not only our society, but more importantly our constitution.

However, this influence is lessening year by year by year. The UK is deciding for itself what is moral and what is immoral. If the latter wasn't true, homosexuality would be illegal along with incest as well.And as culture is subject to change, and morality now is becoming more based on the opinions of culture, what society may find disgusting now may be perfectly fine in 450 years.

Let's fast forward 450 years. What will the UK constitution allow? Will incest be legal? Will polygamous marriage be legal? Will zoophilia be legal?
We know through economics that the world doesn't have enough resources to sustain our booming population for another 450 years. However, let's just say that it will.

Will the legislation of homosexuality be a cause for concern in the future?

This is an ultimate fail.

Also, the economics thing - there is more than enough in the world for everybody. Look how much goes to waste every day.

AIDS spread because people, straight and gay, contracted HIV through having unprotected sex. Though HIV is still largely associated with the gay male community, that is a misconception: in the UK in 2010, the majority of new HIV diagnoses were among the heterosexual population.

This sort of topic generates intense debate between the religious and non-religious people.
It's understandable that some people would like to practice their sexuality without been discriminated, by the rest of the society. it's equally understandably that some people object to it.
However i think people should keep their sexuality to them selves and practice it behind the scenes.

They generally do.

Homosexuality was once a criminal offence now it's no longer in fact same sex couples can now marry, which in my opinion isn't right.
</quote>

Why isn't it right?

Some might disagree with me. However i would say if we as humans were to sustain such population growth then we have to remain heterosexuals, to prevent population decline.
</quote>

Population decline at this point wouldn't be a bad thing anyways.

What is next after the state legalises same sex marriage? Marrying to your pet? That is the view of some people so you can imagine where this may lead to.

How, pray tell, can you relate homosexuality to zoophilia?

The Bible is not a book of fairy tales, it is God's Word, so I do not care what you think of me. When you have a more correct view of Scripture and theology I will respect your opinion on how I look. Capiche?

Come off it, the bible might as well be classed as child's fiction <img src="images/smilies/tongue.png"/> What makes you think it is gods word? (Hint: a quote from the bible doesn't help prove the legitimacy of the bible.)
