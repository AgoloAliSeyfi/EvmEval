You two (Fox and Piff) must have a different version in mind of LBS than I do. I didn't read any LBS books, but I saw many movie shorts depicting a "stereotypical" white-wide-lipped, wide-eyed Sambo,who seemed concocted for the purpose of denigrating black people. Should have known Fox wouldn't have yearned for the return of that.

I must hold a symposium on the difference between PC, unPC and racism.... When we're all up to it--I'd be interested to see how people categorize these things.
