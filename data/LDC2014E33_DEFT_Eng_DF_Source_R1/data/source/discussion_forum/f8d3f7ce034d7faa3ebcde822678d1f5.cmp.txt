We need to expand and take better care of our Military, not gut it and decrease it, not having enough Troops on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan is why things got so fucked up in those places to begin with, we didn't have enough troops to everywhere we needed to be to provide security and we left pockets of those countries open for the insurgents to control.

With the end of Vietnam most elements of the Military were slightly pared down, but not as would have normally occured because of the ongoing Cold War with Russia. Bush I started a a major gut of the military and intelligence capabilities after the Cold War (supposedly) ended which was continued (and accelerated) under Clinton. 9/11 and all subsequent actions afterwards dramatically increased the military and intelligence communities and now that's winding down the paring starts all over again.
We have always followed this route, hell after the Civil War the Federal Army alone went from 1.5 million men to 30,000 almost overnight. The same growth, paring process happened with WWI, WWII and Korea.
