dude don't ask me vacant leading questions like that. you wanna discuss this or just emote and play games?

I answered the query of GTH a page or 2 back,....

here, becasue I like you, I'll re-post it right here;

I saw that as a twitter btw, in any event if 20 guys like this guy went out and committed the same crimes, then there is most probably a common causality, here this isn't the case, he appears unbalanced and....the end of him is the end of this singular event via his madness that drove him to it. I think the mosque and what we see as motivating factor behind Khobar towers, the embassies, the Cole, 911, Hasan are linked, it doesn't disappear with just 20 Terrorists.

as far as evil? no of course not, but its best we be on our guard, theres only one or 2 threads that ties the overarching threat together...*shrugs* what are we supposed to do forget the minute after a T act is committed or self bungled or unsuccessful for whatever reason?

Oh come on Madeline, of all people, YOU should understand this issue.
Here's a question for you:

If someone were to propose tearing down Auschwitz or the Holocaust memorial and replacing it with an "earth-friendly German car dealership"....How would you react?

Come come now...Be truthful.

Seems to me the proper analogy is how would I feel if someone tore down a Burlington Coat Factory and built a House of Worship?

Why wasn't this land "sacred" before the Muslims wanted to build a new mosque? How "sacred" is the land next door, which sports a titty bar?

Just as I thought...You're avoiding the question.
I'll ask again, just to watch the next dance you do to avoid it.

This analogy involves land that was not deemed "sacred" before WWII, but now is.
The analogy is appropriate.

That is the worst analogy ever.

I am merely showing the illogic and inconsistency in what she said, point by point, fact by fact (and which no one is so far disputing, so what I'm saying is apparently indisputable).

What's wrong, exactly, with what I'm doing?
