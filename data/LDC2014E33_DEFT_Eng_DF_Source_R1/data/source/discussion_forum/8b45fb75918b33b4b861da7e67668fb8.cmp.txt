Here is my contention:

Your comment: "Capital punishment certainly incapacitates a criminal, in that executed criminals are not likely to commit subsequent crimes"...

...misstates the actuality of the situation.

"Executed criminals" are not "not likely to commit subsequent crimes -- THEY DAMN WELL WILL NOT COMMIT SUBSEQUENT CRIMES. They will be dead -- which is the usual result of execution.

One of the disadvantages of this type of electronic interchange is that subtleties of expression are often lost. Of course, executed criminals absolutely, positively will not commit further crimes. My earlier comments about the likelihood of them not committing further crimes was mildly ironic -- the expression of which, evidently, did not translate well in this medium.

Your subsequent comment: "But punishment short of death can also accomplish this goal. Pace the objections raised by Scrat, we can, at least theoretically, devise a system of incarceration that minimizes the likelihood of a prisoner, condemned to life without parole, committing further crimes"...

...misstates the actuality also, in that ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY preventing the criminal from EVER committing a subsequent crime CANNOT be ensured via incarceration PERIOD -- and that includes incarceration so onerous and severe as to be inhumane.

Well, first of all, we're dealing with theoretical possibilities here. Furthermore, we're dealing with evolving standards of "cruel and unusual punishment." After all, remember that I'm arguing that death penalty proponents should favor more brutal and cruel methods of execution, which would necessarily entail the repeal of the Eighth Amendment. So "inhumane" forms of incarceration are largely irrelevant to the argument. And, as I mentioned before, if there is ever a question of which type of punishment is worse -- incarceration or death -- the proper response would be to let the prisoner decide which punishment to endure.

Your point, though, is that no method of incarceration can guarantee that a prisoner, convicted of a capital crime, won't commit another crime. I'll grant you that, but at what point are we entitled to insist upon that guarantee? Certainly, capital punishment would also end the criminal careers of habitual rapists, arsonists, check-forgers, burglars, and marijuana growers. Yet we don't extend capital punishment to these types of crimes, even though, in these instances, the permissible goals of incarceration/incapacitation are imperfectly met as well.

As I have mentioned before, capital punishment is unique : thus, it must serve its goals in a unique fashion. If incapacitation can be achieved in a manner short of execution, the state is obliged to choose that method. And if incapacitation is always imperfectly achieved, why are we entitled to insist upon perfect incapacitation in the case of capital crimes?

Anyone who argues that execution should serve the goal of incapacitation must provide additional justification (as I have explained in detail before) why capital punishment is needed. And if we accept imperfect incapacitation in non-capital cases, we need additional justification why perfect incapacitation is needed for capital cases.

Frank, you seem to assume that perfect incapacitation (through means of the death penalty) is justified for prisoners convicted of capital crimes. Yet that is, at this point, an unsupported assumption. Your task, then, is to explain why it's necessary to resort to capital punishment to achieve a level of incapacitation that we don't insist upon for any other crime.

You're chasing your tail here too. The additional justification you seek (to justify the guaranteed solution) is inherent in capital cases by virtue of their being capital cases. What further justification could you need?

@OCCOM BILL,

Though, if I were king, I'd be content to see these offenders face the same fate:

You can add "habitual" domestic violence offenders, child molesters, and other heinous criminals who "habitually" exibit a depraved indifference as well, as far as I'm concerned.

Well, now you're just being deliberately obtuse. The "additional justification" that I was talking about is that which is needed to justify using capital punishment when a sentence of life without parole can accomplish the same ends. In other words, if life without parole incapacitates a prisoner to the same extent as execution, then the state needs additional justification in order to prefer the latter to the former.

You're saying, in effect, that the additional justification is that execution prevents recidivism. But so does life without parole. That's my point. What you need to provide is something more than just the rationale "execution prevents recidivism."

Why not execute people convicted of assault and battery? Or passing bad checks? Or speeding?
