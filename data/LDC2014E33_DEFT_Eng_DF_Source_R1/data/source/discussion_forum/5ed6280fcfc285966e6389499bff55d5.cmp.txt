Thanks for the input guys n' gals. Perhaps the mind will follow the behavior if I simply continue not smoking? <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused"/>

It is true I still think of myself as a smoker..even though I'm not actually doing it...that's weird. I need to work on that: the mental aspect.

Hmm, well if Ms. Squinney ever decides to kick the habit, she will definetly have a lot of people 'having her back'. I know I would.

I just HAD to bump O'Bill's thread. It's 158 pages of quitting-smoking goodness.

My sister was a smoker as a teenager-- the kind that lit up and had a cup of black coffee with it for breakfast. She decided she would quit when she turned 30. She went to a hynotist and hasn't smoked since, and it's been a lot of years.
