If the Government provides Health Care, whether spelled out in this bill or not, it will RATION the care. That is how it works.

The Government can not afford to pay for everything for everyone, even if they took all our money. And in fact the research that backs up this health care bill out of the House spells it out clearly. Specifically it identifies the elderly and those under the age of 2 as being less important and so they will be the first to suffer from reduced services.

Knowing that the Government can not efficiently run anything, I can promise it won't end there.

Is your health care rationed?

Yes it is. There are procedures and medications the Government does not cover. In my specific case several medications I take I can not get at the military hospital because they are not on the list of approved medications so instead I have to use the Tricare system and pay my share rather then get them for free. And some of them require lots of paper work from the doctor to justify every time it is due for refill.

I have bad legs, I need support stockings to keep from losing my legs, guess what? The stockings are expensive and the Government does not pay at all for them, no cost share or anything, NOT tricare and not Medicare. I had to spend weeks in physical therapy with my legs wrapped to get the swelling down enough to get the stockings. All the material I had to buy for those treatments was also not covered.

I can not currently get one of the meds I have taken for years because the Government refuses to pay for it anymore, no cost share nothing, I either have to not take it or pay for it out of pocket.

Currently none of the procedures I have been recommended for are on the no go list, but it exists. Further in the VA hospital where I could get free treatment there is a laundry list of meds and procedures they simply do not authorize ever.

It is the same for active duty, new procedures that were not pioneered by military doctors take years to get approved before they are authorized by the military. Wars can speed the process up but as soon as the war is over it goes back to the same old slow approval process.

Dependents that are on the cheapest ( for them) system of Tricare must wait for space in the Military hospitals or ask for special permission to go out of system ( not always approved) And Military Hospitals are short staff and priority is given active Duty, as it should be.

I chose the more expensive method for Tricare because currently Medicare pays my deductible or rather between the two I generally pay nothing for routine care. I did that before I had medicare and paid the extra because if I had signed on for the other way I would have lost my doctors and had to only go through the military and their approved doctors. I am 90 miles from a VA Hospital so except for a few stays in the mental ward when I was very depressed and could not afford to pay the civilian hospital I do not use it. When I am up there I can not see my family at all.

I was in and out of the wards, civilian and VA 2 or 3 times a year from 96 to 2000. I did not have medicare and had to pay 25 percent of the allowed bill every stay if civilian. I was not able to work when I was in the hospital and was only getting about 1000 dollars in retirement pay, the wife worked at a low paying job as well. My doctor even forgave 2 stays cause I could not pay, he was on the board and just had them write off my part of the bill.

Rationing is a fact of life. It is pretty loose right now for Tricare and the military but not for Medicare and it sure as hell won't be for long when the Government suddenly has to pay BILLIONS more for everyone.

On veterans day I just wanted to say this pisses me off to no end. It may be the sadest most disgusting thing I have ever read. Most of the time I am of the opinion that people should bare some financial burden for their medical expenses, but if there is one group of people that should get free health care, it's veterans. That you have to deal with this crap after serving is absolutely disgusting.

It sounds as if your health care coverage rations in the exact same way that private health care does. The real difference is that your overall coverage cost is cheaper for you...

Which is proof of what I've been telling you people all along. Cheaper does not equal better access, which is suppossedly the goal.
