"This memo showed that the Japanese were offering surrender terms virtually identical to the ones ultimately accepted by the Americans at the formal surrender ceremony on September 2 -- that is, complete surrender of everything but the person of the Emperor."

Have you never realized the Potsdam Declaration was designed to inhibit Japan's surrender so the a-bombs could be used?

Curvelight's "source" is Mark Weber's IHR Article.

Let's see what Good Ol' Mark is all about, shall we?

Mark Weber:
<a href="http://www.adl.org/holocaust/weber.asp">The Professional Denier</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

More than any other propagandist, Mark Weber, 45, embodies the Holocaust-denial movement. An articulate, media-savvy spokesperson with a master's degree in History from Indiana University, Weber got his start in the radical right in 1978, when he took the position of news editor for National Vanguard, a publication of the neo-Nazi National Alliance. In 1979, Weber also began to contribute regularly to The Spotlight, a weekly

tabloid produced by Willis Carto's Liberty Lobby organization. His involvement with the IHR also intensified steadily over the years; initially working as a contributor to the now-defunct IHR Newsletter, Weber began serving as emcee for the group's annual conventions in 1984. In 1985 he became a member of IHR's Editorial Advisory Committee and in 1992 he became editor of the Journal of Historical Review. Following IHR's break with Carto and the subsequent departure of most professional staff members in 1993, Weber became director of the organization with one professional staff person serving under him.

Ahh, yes.

Only those as hopelessly stupid as Curvey would use Weber as a resource. Maybe he has a National Enquirer Article he'd like to present with more credability? Perhaps some Alien in the form of Elvis has an opinion about Ethics and The A-Bomb that Curvey would like to share!! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Well CurveLight? Is this true? You've relied on reporting by a discredited man?

This is the last time I respond when you rely on another poster to state my source instead of asking me directly or ignoring the fact I've pointed to the same article at least three times:

"Walter Trohan, JAPS ASKED PEACE IN JAN. ENVOYS ON WAY  TOKYO Chicago Tribune, August 19, 1945."

It is an indisputable historical fact that the top US military leaders agreed the bombs were not necessary.

What do you think about that fact? I'm beginning to doubt the sincerity of your OP since you have side stepped this at least 4 times.

They were wrong. Once again the Japanese had no intention of surrendering. Even after 2 atomic Bombs the Army which controlled the Government REFUSED to surrender.

</quote>

Or, they never agreed to any such thing: Curvey's source is bogus: You may as well be arguing with someone that claims it was an "Indesputable fact" that Martians agreed the A bombs were not necessary, and quotes an article from the National Enquirer.

You keep lying about my sources you worthless cunt.

General Dwight D. Eisenhower: "In 1945..., Secretary of War Stimson visited my headquarters in Germany, [and] informed me that our government was preparing to drop an atomic bomb on Japan. I was one of those who felt that there were a number of cogent reasons to question the wisdom of such an act.... During his recitation of the relevant facts, I had been conscious of a feeling of depression and so I voiced to him my grave misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary..."

Admiral William Leahy told President Truman: "This is the biggest fool thing we have ever done."

Anyone! Try to go to the source above and see if there's an offer of "Unconditional Surrender."
