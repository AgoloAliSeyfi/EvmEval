And that is also fine and dandy but that gives you no right to slander those who make no such demands.
If you wouldn't demand the taxpayer subsidize your gasoline in every post I might take you seriously.
You've lost it. I've never demanded the tax payer subsidize my gasoline in any post.

Do you have some explaination or do you commonly just spout whatever wild-assed lie pops into your head?
Again.

What have the poor done to deserve our support?

They provide an example of what happens when you fuck up your life.

We need fewer people on welfare, not more.

Well no shit. Why don't you propose just how it is that these welfare recipients are going to get that working poor job.

Where are the Repubcon "job creators". I mean, what could be better than employing a person with no skills and no education? You only have to pay them minimum wage.

Someoen with no skills isn't worth minimum wage. That's why they're unemployed. Reduce min wage and we can see some job growth. And as people develop skills from their starter job they will earn more.

Now we can see why you are such a rocket scientist

Just what we need to help people escape poverty....slashing wages and benefits

So Rabbi...according to your economic model. If you are paying some guy minimum wage to sweep your floors, if you slash minimum wage you will now hire two guys to sweep your floors

Many restaurant workers do not make minimum wage. They depend on tips.

I hope you mean Nutwinger. I guess it never occurred to him that if you expect people to work their way up you need to have somewhere they can start. With a high min wage it cuts out lots of starting jobs, like theater ushers and the like, that teenagers typically got back in the 50s, 60s etc. Now there is hardly any way a teenager can get job experience so they are more employable.
We raised the min wage and teenaged unemployment went through the roof. And the Dems want it even higher.

If they need a theater usher they will hire one at minimum wage. Fact is, they don't need them. Jobs are determined by the work that needs to be accomplished. Cutting the minimum wage does not mean you have more work

Raising the minimum wage is why we no longer have theater ushers, or gas station attendants. We got self serve gas stations when the minimum wage made it cost effective. We used to have a LOT of entry level jobs for kids that the minimum wage got rid of. Remember the paper boy?
