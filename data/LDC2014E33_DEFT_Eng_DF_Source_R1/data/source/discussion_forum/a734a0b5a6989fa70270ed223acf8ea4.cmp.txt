OK, I am a goodie two shoes when it comes to work, and I have never called in sick to work when I wasn't really actually sick.

That said, this weekend is both mother's day and my sons 3rd birthday and we have my parents, my brother and his wife, and dh's sister and her husband coming, and my sister and her husband might come too. And there is every possibility I will have to work at least Saturday or Sunday. I don't find out until the last minute if I have to work, and then I never know how long I'll have to work until they say we can leave (I proofread for the legislature so it all depends on what they do that day)

So last weekend we were here ALL day Saturday (not really doing anything btw). The family is only staying saturday, some leaving sunday and I need to squeeze in making a cake and also I never get to see these family members....about 3 times a year tops. So it is a big deal that they are coming. But since it is legislative session, we are not allowed to take any time off unless we are sick or have an emergency. So I'm thinking of calling in sick. It freaks me out since I am such a rule follower when it comes to this stuff, but honestly, we don't do much work while we're here, so it is very unlikely my co-workers would suffer, and I know they can't say yes even if they wanted to if I ask for time off since it is a policy that we cant' have it. So I was just curious what you guys think and if you have called in fake sick before if it was worth it. Ok, thanks! <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

i have to say im bad and have called in sick before when i wasnt really sick. I was forever going in on my day off or coming in early or staying late because people didnt show up or wanted to leave early so i felt like they could deal with it. If you are usually really good about it i dont see why it would hurt if you called out sick for this one weekend.

I've done it two or three times. It's called a Mental Health Day. Consider it a preventative measure and use it wisely. Hope your weekend turns out wonderful and happy birthday to your son.

I have done it in the past, however in February I lost my job while I was out for 5 day seriously injured, the day I came back I was fired <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/mad.gif"/> The funny thing is they didn't believe I was really hurt (I was in a neck brace and on 3 different pain killers, and had a note and everything) Now I filed a wrongful termination complaint, looks bad for them!

In short, I would call in sick If there was a good reason to do so, such as the one you stated! Plus, In CA they have to give you notice before your schedule.

GL and have fun! <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

I have called in sick when I wasn't Cat...not often but I have done it. I think it's bizarre that you couldn't have booked the weekend off,but I do understand that it's their policy...policies are sometimes really dumb....for lack of a better term lol. Obviously this is something you don't do often or ever for that matter,so if I were you Cat I would go ahead,and call in.....besides it sounds like you are going to have a really busy weekend without going to work anyways...and one of the number one rules of pregnancy IS don't over extend yourself...sooooo technically you are "safeguarding" yourself <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

As for if it's worth it....this is your family,so of course it is! <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>
