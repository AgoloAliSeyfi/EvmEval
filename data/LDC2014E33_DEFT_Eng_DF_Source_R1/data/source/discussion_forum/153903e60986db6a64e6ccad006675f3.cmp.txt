Dude, I'm frankly disgusted by this, how those that represent us can even suggest spending money that we do not have on this when this nation has so many issues to address at home. Whats most ironic about this, is that these are the same people who have made their careers condemning the previous Administration for it's forrays into Iraq and Afghanistan and complaining about spending money there that could have been spent here at home.

You actually bought in to their bullshit?

Each party has things they want to waste money on, that have little to do with helping the nation out.

For the GoP douchebags, they had bought into the FDR/Truman world police deal, and want to invade countries and buy lots weapons.

For the Democrats, its goofy socialist programs that don't really help people but instead make them more depended on government and throwing money at the rest of the world, no matter how broke we are.

Both are disgusting.

I don't know what in my post led you to ask that idea there Xeno, however I will say this, like most Republicans back during the lead up to the war, I won't run from what I was thinking back then like some do these days. I felt when Gen. Powell gave his speech to the UN that the evidence sounded credible not having the virtue of being in the CIA or knowing the assesments that others were looking at. Further, I also thought that the original mission in Afghanistan to seek out terrorists and destroy them was in principle a good mission, but will be the first to tell you that it was and has been wholly mismanaged. So given the last Administrations management and free spending and the current one it's hard to know where one ends and the other begins.

One of the oldest principles of war is, don't start one unless you are fully prepared to do whatever it takes to win it.

This has been forgotten for over 60 yars now, so we see repeats over and over of 'interventions' that solve nothing and just add up casualties.

I knew both wars would be a waste of lives and money, and that the USA was not even fighting its real enemy.

The real enemy is our 'friends' in the saudi Royal family who spend billions on converting people to violent whabbist fundementalist islam, we do NOTHING about this, and even help them do it.

Chasing about Afghanistan will never stop our real foes.

The United States on Thursday announced it would help build a $100 billion annual fund by 2020 to help poor countries cope with climate change, but said its commitment depended on whether the nations gathered here could reach a substantive pact that includes "transparency" on tracking emissions cuts.

<a href="http://www.theroot.com/buzz/us-commits-100-billi-poor-nations-climate-change">US commits 100 billion dollars for climate change initiatives for poor nations</a>

So are we just going to borrow more money from China to put into this fund and let furute generations of Americans watch this nation slide deeper into debt. When this nation is having trouble employing its own people, and finding funding for healthcare we come up with money for this. This is truley a poor decision.

If this is signed, it will be legallly binding, won't it?
I think it's suppose to start in 2020.
Just more redistribution of wealth to the pockets of corrupt governments

Interesting question wouldn't this be a treaty? if so would not this require some sort of congressional approval? I'm not sure, but I would venture to guess that the President cannot just take 100 Billion and give it to some worldwide fund for climate change without some sort of congressional approval.

No Congress can leagally bind a future Congress.

No mater what is agreed to it can always be changed, nothing is written in stone.
