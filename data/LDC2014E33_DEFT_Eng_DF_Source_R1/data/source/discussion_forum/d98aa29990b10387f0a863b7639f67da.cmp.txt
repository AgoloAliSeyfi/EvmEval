We need fewer people on welfare, not more.

Well no shit. Why don't you propose just how it is that these welfare recipients are going to get that working poor job.

Where are the Repubcon "job creators". I mean, what could be better than employing a person with no skills and no education? You only have to pay them minimum wage.

Someoen with no skills isn't worth minimum wage. That's why they're unemployed. Reduce min wage and we can see some job growth. And as people develop skills from their starter job they will earn more.

Now we can see why you are such a rocket scientist

Just what we need to help people escape poverty....slashing wages and benefits

So Rabbi...according to your economic model. If you are paying some guy minimum wage to sweep your floors, if you slash minimum wage you will now hire two guys to sweep your floors

"But lots of people are. And they are the problem, simply because they cause a demand on other people's resources."

And that is also fine and dandy but that gives you no right to slander those who make no such demands.

If you wouldn't demand the taxpayer subsidize your gasoline in every post I might take you seriously.

You've lost it. I've never demanded the tax payer subsidize my gasoline in any post.

Do you have some explaination or do you commonly just spout whatever wild-assed lie pops into your head?

When you get that minimum wage job with no benes, how long are they going to keep it?

When you can't pay for child care, how long are you going to work.

If you get sick and fired for missing work, oh well.

From the discussions I read on here, people would think it is easy to be poor. They have big screens, but they bought them from a person that sells stolen goods. They have a cell phone. Whoop t do. How they gonna conduct their "bidness" without a cell phone? So they have medical issues. That is what 911 calls are for. And hospital emergency rooms.

Much easier to be rich. As long as you don't want to tax them more. Then it is really REALLY hard to defend your money.

But it is much easier if you have poor people to blame for not paying taxes. Then rich people can say that if poor people don't pay income taxes then why should they pay even more income taxes.

Doesn't make any difference if the fact poor people pay no income tax is the result of the tax writing policies put in place by the Repubcons so the stupid Dems would go along with the tax package that lowered the tax rates on the wealthy.

It is the poor persons fault.

Poor people have really sucky lobbyists.

Aww poor people. It's just really tough. Much easier to sit back and get dat gummint check. Let's make it easy for everyone. Hey, let's just send everyone a gummint check every month and no one will have child care worries or problems paying rent.

I hope you mean Nutwinger. I guess it never occurred to him that if you expect people to work their way up you need to have somewhere they can start. With a high min wage it cuts out lots of starting jobs, like theater ushers and the like, that teenagers typically got back in the 50s, 60s etc. Now there is hardly any way a teenager can get job experience so they are more employable.
We raised the min wage and teenaged unemployment went through the roof. And the Dems want it even higher.
