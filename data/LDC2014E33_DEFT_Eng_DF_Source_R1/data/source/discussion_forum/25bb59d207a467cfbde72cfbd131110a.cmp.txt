Funny how the left is hating on this guy for raising money for the kids of fallen special forces.

Ohh so why are people going to waste all that money going to DC when they could mail it to the kids of fallen special forces?

Just mail in what you would spend on bus and hotel, etc.

I did not realize it was a charity event.

Conservatives are the most charitable group in the US. How much have you donated to charity this year?

Obama and The Democrats: Are You Listening?

If President Obama does not alter course swiftly, if the Democrat Congress does not fully understand the encompassing mistrust against their socialist direction now permeating the American subconscious, the Democrat Party may very well be relegated to the scrap heap of history. The Democrats, under the overtly misguided, impractical, and contradictory leadership of President Obama, have openly turned against those Americans who have the clarity of courage to question the necessity and soundness of their intended policies, equating these outspoken citizens to Nazis, thugs, and all things un-American. Thomas Jefferson, in one of his deepest moments of national reflection, spoke as well as any to the point of a government grown far beyond its own means, and at the expense of the citizens its existence is intended to serve when he stated, I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just.

Another Jefferson moment of clarity (3/31/1809, 20 years following signing the Constitution):

"The care of human life and happiness, and not their destruction, is the first and only legitimate object of good government."

Why not? My needs are small, everything is paid for and I have less than a year to live.

I bought my ladyfriend a new Camry earlier this year, but I bought that out of my gold eagles.
Most of the rest of my actual income goes for food electricity,etc and for paying my help.

Throughout history America has seen many great leaders and noteworthy citizens change her course. It is through their personal virtues and by their example that we are able to live as a free people. On August 28, come celebrate America by honoring our heroes, our heritage and our future.

Join the Special Operations Warrior Foundation, Glenn Beck, Sarah Palin and many more for this non-political event that pays tribute to Americas service personnel and other upstanding citizens who embody our nations founding principles of integrity, truth and honor.

Our freedom is possible only if we remain virtuous. Help us restore the values that founded this great nation. On August, 28th, come join us in our pledge to restore honor at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC.

Oh that explains a lot, sure. What "virtues" and "values" is he talking about? And why was it necessary to include the word "warrior" to define his latest "special operation"??

Why is it loudmouths like Beck think that only conservative ideologues are patriotic? Morally superior? Most virtuous? He and his minions have set about keeping this great nation divided. If anything, it is that asshole that is UNpatriotic, immoral, and hardly "virtuous" because what he is doing is the most UNAmerican thing that can happen in these troubled times.
