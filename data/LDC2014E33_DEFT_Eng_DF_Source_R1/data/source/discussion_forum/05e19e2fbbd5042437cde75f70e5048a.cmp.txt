Been drinking the cool aide ain't ya Billy?

Obama ain't offered SHIT! He...has been missing in action through this whole thing. As a matter of fact, the FIRST thing he did when he came back to town was to give companies ANOTHER tax loop hole...you know, like the ones he CLAIMS he wants to close...only this one is so magnanimous that he thinks we won't call it what it is. See, it's a TAX BREAK to companies and corporations that hire vets.

Take THAT occupy wall street!

Ain't that wonderful of the man? Set up a system to fail so that it cuts the defense budget in half, puts thousands of soldiers in harm's way without the equipment they need and then give corporations tax breaks to hire them when they come back in wheel chairs and on crutches. Wonderful man ain't he?

This is EXACTLY what Obummer and the democrats WANTED to happen with that stupid super committee crap in exchange for raising the debt ceiling in the first place. If you doubt it, just look at the ideologues they put on the thing.

The only mistake the republicans made was in voting to raise the debt ceiling in exchange for anything short of repealing Obamacare and passing the Ryan budget that actually would have cut 4 TRILLION out of the budget.

This president and the democrat party has not only not passed, but has not even OFFERED A BUDGET since Obama took office...little on offered some grand deficit reduction scheme.

Something that I might add has NEVER HAPPENED before in the history of this country and they damn well could have done since they controlled BOTH HOUSES of Congress for the first 2 years Obama has been in office. 900+ days with out a budget and in contempt of the Constitution.

By the way, the TRUTH of the super committee negotiations is that the democrats didn't off ONE SINGLE PLAN. The republicans offered several and the last one that the democrats rejected out of hand actually included closing the tax loop holds you mistakenly seem to think the democrats want. However, as I said, they rejected it out of hand.

They really only want to SAY they want to close the loop holes. They don't want to get caught actually doing it by their corporate masters and fat cat donors!

Obummer.

I really am fascinated by all these whimsical nicknames thrown out by individuals such as this. I really should catalogue them, just so I can provide at a moment's notice a reference to all the 'sage' things they come up with.

I notice it just as much on these forums as I do anywhere else on the internet. It's in the DNA.
