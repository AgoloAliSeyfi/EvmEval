These same people didn't seem to have a problem when there was a campaign going on to pull ads from the Glen Beck show.

Go to Lowes and shop folks. It's still a free country and I don't care what their reason are for pulling their ads. It's no ones business.

wow... I don't remember a "campaign" of any sort... I think Beck dug his own grave with his false version of Christianity and his outlandish nature.

There was a concentrated effort on the part of the left, led by Media Matters, to get advertisers to pull their ads from Beck's show.

Which I personally have no problem with. Beck is a horrible human being.

Lowes pulled an ad they had placed on All-American Muslim essentially claiming that the show was to controversial. Now they are getting a lot of flack claiming that they are upholding an anti Muslim bigoted attitude. As I understand it, the show is based around AMERICAN Muslims and the struggles they are facing in a post 9/11 America. While I have no issues with how Lowes decides to advertise, this does seem like a bone headed move particularly considering that I would have never even known about the show in the first place until Lowes created this controversy. Many people are now calling Lowes Bigoted for this move.

Your thoughts?

They are free to do this. And they shouldn't complain or ask for federal aid when they experience a backlash.

Elaborate, please.

</quote>

I completely agree with both points. However, I personally would not have pulled the ad's unless the ratings were lower than I wanted them to be for a time slot my commercial would air.

</quote>

Why??

I would have pulled the ads just because the show was horse shit and a mockery of our freedom, hence no one wanted to watch it..

Quite frankly I would have never advertised with the program to begin with...

The whole concept was an oxymoron from the start..

Not that they will, but why should federal aid be linked to whether a company is "politically correct" or not.

There's only one good reason why a company should get a bailout, and that's if the consequences of its sudden collapse would be more economically disasterous than just letting the market take its course, and if it has a reasonable change of viability after the bailout in order to pay the money back.
