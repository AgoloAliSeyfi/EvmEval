So we've heard 2 years worth of Obama whining like his OWS peasants, Him mostly whining about a "do nothing Congress" and the "GOP obstruction" stopping him from doing anything.

Now unemployment is down to 8.6%. And libtards are dropping to their knees to PRAISE HIM!!!!

Why? CEO's approved this hiring. Corporations funded it. Barack Hussein Obama has been hampered by a "do nothing Congress" and "GOP obstructionists"......right?

So when shit goes bad, Obama is immune from blame, because a do-nothing Congress and the GOP are preventing Him from dong anything.

But when things go well, He gets immediate credit, despite the fact that all that new hiring is being done by the very CEO's and corporations He and his ilk spew verbal venom at every chance they get.

Thanks to all the CEO's and corporations for taking the chance to go ahead and hire. We know, with Obama in office the future is very unknown and shaky, but you guys hired anyway. Keep up the good work. And Mr. President...try not to fuck it up. Of course, you cant't do much with a do-nothing Congress, so not sure why you got credit for it anyway.

Which CEOs, specially, do we thank?

</quote>

Start with the one that pays you.

Because, unless you are a government employee, a CEO is in charge of you being employed and paid. That "CEO" might be Mom or Pop and their community grocery store. It might be the CEO of Boeing or WalMart. It might be the CEO who owns wealthy, but local, food chains, like Charleston's Sticky Fingers, or the South's Chic Fil A.

But if you work, and you aren't a gov't employee, then somewhere out there is a person who enables your continued employment. Not saying we must kiss anyones ass. Not saying we "owe" them anything. They ask for a job to be done, we ask for payment. So long as both keep doing their part, the deal is going.

So, I thank the CEO who decided to keep my position funded, and the manager who hired me.

There has got to be a way that we can all hook up to a service like "Go To Meeting" annonymously next November 6th. I would pay a fair sum to be able to see the looks on the faces of these crazy people.
