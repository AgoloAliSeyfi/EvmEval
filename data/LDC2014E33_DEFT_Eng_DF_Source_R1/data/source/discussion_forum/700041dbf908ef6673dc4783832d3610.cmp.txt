<img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> You're quoting a left wing propaganda site as a legitimate source? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

7% shareholder..... and you're seriously gonna continue to pretend he 'runs' FNC? Even an idiot can see the numbers don't add up.

I despise willful stupidity. Pathetic spinning and whining instead of using basic logic... you're making yourself look ridiculous.

Interesting, since you just used WIKI as a source, but just a few months ago said this about WIKI:

<quote orig_author="California Girl">
Seriously, you're citing 'wiki' as the absolute authority? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

You do know that it's not a source for unbiased, strictly fact based information, right?

</quote>

I love busting you with your own words. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

</quote>

Not 'busting' at all. I don't rate wiki, for the reasons I cited previously... it is too easy to abuse the editing system.

</quote>

Yet you run to wiki when it's conveniet. As I already stated.

<quote>
However, they are right... it is a 7% share.

</quote>

How do you know this, if Wiki is unreliable, as you claim?

<quote>
And, I know that other people find wiki acceptable... so I go with it....

</quote>

"other people" find MediaMatters, DailyKos and Moveon.org acceptable - do you use those, also? If you ever have, then link up!

You haven't. You won't. You can't.

<quote>
you can wiggle and whine as much as you like but I proved the statement of 'the saudis run Fox News' to be utter bullshit. That is why you're pissed.

</quote>

You're confusing me with another poster. Because you're confused. AND busted! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

<quote>
But... I am entertained that you trawled the site in a desperate need to 'prove' something that I would happily have conceded - had you just asked. idiot.

</quote>

No need - I save definitive statements from wingnuts for just these situations. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

I don't value wiki that highly as a source.... simply because it is open to biased editing and has, on many occasions, been factually inaccurate.

</quote>

Yet you are quick to use it when it backs up your contention, right? That's dishonest.

<quote>
I am independent.... in that I have no allegiance to any political party... I am certainly a fiscal conservative... socially, not so much. That's being independent. Twit.

</quote>

You are? But you just claimed that you were a conservative. Not "I am fiscally conservative", or "I have some things in common with conservatives" - you said "I'm a conservative". That's also dishonest.

Busted! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

You're beginning to sound like a 3 year old, Sythia. If you find me so hard to handle, don't deal with me. You're limited intellect must struggle with anyone who is open minded and rational.... I know those concepts are alien to you.

Stupid boy.

Synthia, here is an easy rule of thumb for anyone with respect to using Wiki as a source:

Sure, go to wikipedia, that's fine. If you find the info there that you need, check to see if it's cited to a separate source. If it is, check the source. If that is good, use it.

Easy.

And the 7% is cited, thrice:

35. Murdoch's son sees pay doubled ahead of exit, Daily Telegraph, 26 August 2005.
36. Charlie Rose interview with Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, video.google.com
37. Li, Kenneth (22 January 2010). "Alwaleed backs James Murdoch". Financial Times (Pearson PLC). Retrieved 23 January 2010.

Seems solid to me.

Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!!!

I got some sweet quotes from Megyn Kelly

<quote orig_author="Megyn Kelly, on 'The O'Reilly Factor'">
This stinks to high heaven, and the way the police handled this, stinks to high heaven...This looks like a terrible situation...As far as second-degree murder, that charge looks very promising for the D.A...The Stand your ground law, that's not what this case is about. Even the guy who authored the law has said, "My law doesn't apply here..." That does not apply when I go over to you, I create the circumstances of a confrontation, then you start using force against me, I can't then use that law to use deadly force against you. It's written right into the law that you can't use that law in those circumstances.

</quote>

Exactly what myself, and others, have been saying about the matter from the very beginning.
