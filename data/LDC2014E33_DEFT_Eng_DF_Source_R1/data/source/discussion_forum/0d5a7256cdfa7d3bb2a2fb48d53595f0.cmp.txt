If there is an American that does not indirectly employ a boat load of illegal immigrants here and Chinks over there then let me be the first to shake his hand.

Really has nothing to do with what I said, but let's look at that. The people who control commerce have made the decision that the middle class made too much money back in the 1980's and they didn't have enough to buy all the Polo Ponies they wanted.

So they insisted on free trade with countries like China that chop up their own citizens for transplant organs.

And they insisted on "right to work" laws that busted up the unions.

And they insisted on lax immigration laws.

Now, I agree, it would be nice if we all employed a bit of common sense and spent the few extra pennies to only buy what is made here.

It would be better if we refocused our illegal immigration efforts off the poor immigrants and onto the rich assholes who pay them under the table so they won't have to pay an American a fair wage.

And this is where "conservatives" like you and Romney have really messed it up. In your effort to get rid of the middle class and unions, you've made people more dependent on government, and therefore, more likely to vote for more of it.

Anyone that has a nickel in their pocket has a part in controlling commerce.
Everyone should have a right to work. Forcing folk to join a union to be able to work is as unAmerican as it gets.
Why should I have to pay a union boss that works 8 hours a month 100K a year to be able to work?

</quote>

You shouldn't - if you would have the same wages and benefits without the union.

Unions are for those that do not have the skills and education to be able to negotiate their own wages in a free market.
Underachievingt lazy Americans need unions. Hard working skilled professionals never need a union. They can negotiate their own contract without having to carry the fat, lazy, uneducated, low skilled and dependent union worker.
Unions are for those that have no other skill other than a 5th grade educated worker has with a hammer in their hand.

we all knew that Santorums biggest set back was the fact that he doesn't come off as presidential, but he does have one vital thing going for him,,he is very likable and the GOP and Conservative base will settle for him much more than Romney. then again, Obama was never presidential, if anything, a stuttering senator with no personality and needed cue cards just to speak to an audience.

LOL. You must also think leprosy and smallpox are very likable. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>
