By FRANK RICH

Excerpt:

TO paraphrase Al Pacino in “Godfather III,” just when we thought we were out, the Bush mob keeps pulling us back in. And will keep doing so. No matter how hard President Obama tries to turn the page on the previous administration, he can’t. Until there is true transparency and true accountability, revelations of that unresolved eight-year nightmare will keep raining down drip by drip, disrupting the new administration’s high ambitions.

That’s why the president’s flip-flop on the release of detainee abuse photos " whatever his motivation " is a fool’s errand. The pictures will eventually emerge anyway, either because of leaks (if they haven’t started already) or because the federal appeals court decision upholding their release remains in force. And here’s a bet: These images will not prove the most shocking evidence of Bush administration sins still to come.

There are many dots yet to be connected, and not just on torture....

* * *

But the new administration doesn’t want to revisit this history any more than it wants to dwell on torture. Once the inspector general’s report on the military analysts was rescinded, the Obama Pentagon declared the matter closed. The White House seems to be taking its cues from the Reagan-Bush 41 speechwriter Peggy Noonan. “Sometimes I think just keep walking,” she said on ABC’s “This Week” as the torture memos surfaced. “Some of life has to be mysterious.” Imagine if she’d been at Nuremberg!

The administration can’t “just keep walking” because it is losing control of the story. The Beltway punditocracy keeps repeating the cliché that only the A.C.L.U. and the president’s “left-wing base” want accountability, but that’s not the case. Americans know that the Iraq war is not over. A key revelation in last month’s Senate Armed Services Committee report on detainees " that torture was used to try to coerce prisoners into “confirming” a bogus Al Qaeda-Saddam Hussein link to sell that war " is finally attracting attention. The more we learn piecemeal of this history, the more bipartisan and voluble the call for full transparency has become.

And I do mean bipartisan. Both Dick Cheney, hoping to prove that torture “worked,” and Nancy Pelosi, fending off accusations of hypocrisy on torture, have now asked for classified C.I.A. documents to be made public. When a duo this unlikely, however inadvertently, is on the same side of an issue, the wave is rising too fast for any White House to control. Court cases, including appeals by the “bad apples” made scapegoats for Abu Ghraib, will yank more secrets into the daylight and enlist more anxious past and present officials into the Cheney-Pelosi demands for disclosure.

It will soon be every man for himself. “Did President Bush know everything you knew?” Bob Schieffer asked Cheney on “Face the Nation” last Sunday. The former vice president’s uncharacteristically stumbling and qualified answer " “I certainly, yeah, have every reason to believe he knew...” " suggests that the Bush White House’s once-united front is starting to crack under pressure.

I’m not a fan of Washington’s blue-ribbon commissions, where political compromises can trump the truth. But the 9/11 investigation did illuminate how, a month after Bush received an intelligence brief titled “Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.,” 3,000 Americans were slaughtered on his and Cheney’s watch. If the Obama administration really wants to move on from the dark Bush era, it will need a new commission, backed up by serious law enforcement, to shed light on where every body is buried.

@dlowan,

<quote orig_author="dlowan">
Well, if it is not a reinstitution of properly constituted tribunals, with due process etc I would agree with Thomas.

But I am not sure why people are making the assumption that what Obama proposes is pretty much the same as the Bush things.

What do you mean by the "re" in "reinstitution"? There never have been any properly constituted tribunals to deal with alleged terrorist caught in the ill-defined battlefield in the vaguely defined war on terror. These tribunals were coughed up on the fly, after the alleged offenders were caught and locked up. Their rules were made up as the process went along, depending on what was politically convenient at the time, and what the courts would let the government get away with. This is screwed up, and this alone dooms the military tribunals to be kangaroo courts.

And we appear to be stuck with them, now that Obama has taken the option of non-kangaroo courts off the table. Trying the alleged unlawful enemy combatants in federal courts is out. Trying them in court martials (which I personally consider the least bad compromise) is out. All we have is kangaroo courts, and Obama's promise to have them run by competent kangaroos, following proper kangaroo procedures.

Not good enough.

@Thomas,

There were NORMAL military tribunals....with certain rules of evidence etc.

As I read it, there were the ones the military's own lawyers believed should be used on Guantanamo etc. suspects.
