So you agree that if only 10% of what hacks like you say were true then our wonderful country would have folded in 1777? Or did I confuse you with someone with a different critical thinking skill set?

No, moron. Unlike idiots like you, I don't subscribe to the positively retarded notion that those who disagree with chumps like you are "hacks." I read the drivel bullshit spew you posted. Ergo, it is clear that it is you who are the hack.

And no. The Country did well in terms of setting the foundation for what has lasted so far almost 240 years BECAUSE they subscribed to the things I believe and those whom morons like YOU consider "hacks" believe.

You wouldn't RECOGNIZE a critical thinking skill set, ya dickweed. You'd have to be able to think on your own. Clearly, you can't.

My, my. This is a positive thread about the Prez as some here said never happens and bam, the idiots show up and try and make it about themselves and how they view their perceived terribleness of 'Murica. For shame, for shame. Like I said earlier, if only 10% of the horseshit you rightwing bitches said were true then our wonderful country would have folded like a cheap suit in or about 1777.

The idiots, dope, are the obamawannablowhim tube steaks, like you, who see no wrong in that imbecile.

As President, he sucks.

It is because of leftwing goobers like you that we are in danger of losing our Republic.

Adherents of the system crafted for us by the Framers and the Founders -- that is, the conservatives -- are the bulwark AGAINST the idiocy of schmucks, like you, who would have cost us the Republic by now if you had been given your desires.

I have a history of giving due credit to President Obama for the few things he has done right.

Assholes such as you are utterly unable to admit how bad he is, however, in light of all he has done so terribly.

You are laughable.

And you smell like a sock.

Had it been any one of those other palookas, say, Cain'n'Palin the country would have been in shambles.

Obama has pulled the country back from the brink of disaster that Bush'n'Cheney had left it in.

He's created ObamaCare, because, as we all know, Obama cares.

He's brought dignity back to the Office.

The economy has been steadily ticking up.

He saved GM...a WHOPPING success.

He got Bin Laden from a place that Bush didn't dare to go into. Khaddaffi's gone. Pirates of the seas know they can't 'EFF around with Americans or any of their properties.

He helped to liberate a country from a tyrant w/o spending too much time, money and with no casualties.

The rest of the world knows the same. Although he's not going around screaming about how big'n'tuff 'Murrka is.

He's pulling us out of war.

And, once again, the economy continues to tick up, despite his opponents in the GOP's efforts to undermine him at every. single. turn.

Yeah...I'd say Obama's a shoe-in for the next election.

Not to mention, History is going to be VERY kind to Obama...unlike the last guy.

I think of you, nowadays, as a brother, Marc!

But you're kinda like the crazy uncle.

President Obama is doing a bang up job.
