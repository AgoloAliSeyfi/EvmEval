Why are you living here ?

Oh yeah because Pakistan is a poverty stricken, third world, failed state.... silly me.

You seem like those stupid football hooligans. Why did you mention Pakistan? Islam didn't originate in Pakistan, most Muslims are not Pakistani, and the pakistani government isn't even ruling by islamic laws. Idiot. And how do you even know that I am not English or partly English?

Pakistan is being Westernised, and with it will come rational thought, less religious nutcases and greater economic prosperity.

The success story of the West is being projected worldwide, unfortunately... I fear that some beautiful cultures may be displace by a monolithic, boring Western culture.

I would answer this if it were not for the ad-hominem attacks and insults.

OH please, the only person bending over backwards for Jinnah was Ghandi. Of course India did not want the partition, the INC rather, they wanted to rule the whole of India, and regardless of Caste, it would have been a Hindu majority.

By that logic then, Europe should be Rome? Various Empires have ruled various landmasses at various times, that doesn't make that a nation. At the time of the BEIC starting it's gradual rise to power in India, there was no India in the sense of a single nation. It was a patchwork of independant kingdoms, states and wastelands.

Oh you are the witty one. Oh, and what's that? Oh yes, a total lack of sourcing for any of your claims when they are challenged. I notice you tried to dodge it. Poor form my dear, poor form.

no, as i epxlained to yo,u the ashokan India was one nation with borders from afganistan to bhutan. Youre an idiot plain and simple and have been disproven by at least 3 different people on this thread already. The problem with idiots, is they are usually the last people to recognise the fact.

I apologise in advance if there is something similar to this thread, but this is a topic that has interested me recently and would just like to hear your views on the matter.
I'm a British Pakistani, born and brought up in London, however I would say I am very much in touch with my roots and my views lean more towards the traditional and conservative side. Recently I watched a documentary by Saira Khan 'Don't tell my Mother I am in Pakistan', made a few years ago, yet a very interesting watch. I have been on holiday to Pakistan a fair amount of times, and have traveled throughout the country, so I thought I had a pretty accurate idea of the country as a whole and it's people. However, after watching the documentary and various other programs and films on Pakistan I am absolutely shocked. I may be wrong when I say this, but was Pakistan not founded as a Muslim state, yet only 64 years on and I don't think the country matches the vision it was initially created with. It seems that the higher class are obsessed with imitating and adopting western culture, in a sense it boosts their superiority complex. I actually find it shocking, that most families who moved to England in the 60's like my grandfather have managed to maintain that cultural pride and certain traditions that have been lost among certain groups of people in Pakistan. Drinking is a common practice with the upper class society and personally I find it quite upsetting, it seems as if Pakistan is moving in the opposite direction- the rich becoming more obsessed with western culture and the less well off being neglected further. Also whilst I'm on this topic, has anyone seen the film 'Slackistan' and what were your views?
Thank for reading my thoughts! <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

Its all about class and wealth.... the wealth middle classes are westernised, due to education, travel etc (and they tend to be less religous) etc.....my gfs family are from pakistan and they're typical pakistani rahs (western outlook, but still hold onto thier pakistani/islamic cultural heritage.

I went to Pakistan in December, the Christmas hols after 4 years, and was absolutely shocked to see girls in Lahore walking about in denim mini skirts with no tights, tight sleeveless tops and highlighted short short hair!
To see this is Pakistan absolutely shocked me, we here have more culture within us than them over there.. My cousins even told me about undercover nightclubs where people go and get drunk..
My dad said its all signs of the day of judgement, one of the signs is that islam will disappear in the east and rise again from the west.. And I can actually see this happening...
