I'm sure in your mind he is Sallow. Most leftists buy into all the hate stuff put out there on somebody like Newt. I have not seen any bigotry or racism in Gingrich however, nor in Buchanan for that matter--Buchanan has been right on the edge of anti-semitism a time or two however--but both have focused mostly on the truth of the human condition which, to the left, is not allowed in our politically correct world.

Oh gosh, really?

And you write for a newspaper or something like that?

Bigotry is holding that one's culture or religion is superior to others and racism is holding that one's race is superior to others.

Both Newt and Pat have commented and wrote about the superiority of the west, Christainity and the white race. Google is your friend.

I am aware of the slant that people like you put on it. I have also read what both have written on the subject. And your take is mean spirited and based on the leftist political correct notion that the white race or the American/European culture is NEVER to be recognized for any accomplishments and anyone who presumes to do so shall be branded white supremacist and/or racist.

Ability to analyze content critically, reading comprehension, and honest critique would be your friend if you would allow it to be.

There's nothing wrong with regonizing the accomplishments of cultures. Absolutely nothing. But when you start saying they are superior to others..you get into some really dodgy terroritory.

Please take your own advice.

I'm not viewing PB with any slant. I'm reading what he says. He's a racist and anti-Semite. He says we should have sided with Hitler. He questions the Holocaust. He says that we need white people in power or the culture will fall.

As for PC, you're setting up a straw man. Your claim is not even close to mainstream liberal, left, or Democratic rhetoric.

MAY: Trump is gonna kick Obama's ass!

JULY: Bachmann is gonna kick Obama's ass!

SEPTEMBER: Perry is gonna kick Obama's ass!

OCTOBER: Cain is gonna kick Obama's ass!

NOVEMBER: Newt is gonna kick Obama's ass!

If Santorum can just hold out a while longer, he'll be kicking Obama's ass, too! And when it's all over, and wingnuts have finished running their mouth, Romney will get demolished by Obama. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Clintons transgressions appear to be forgiven by the left. Aw whats a little obstruction of justice and perjury. Jeeze the guy was only a sitting POTUS.

As for Newt well lets get out the tar and feathers.

Newt the smartest guy in the room and is way more competant that the joker sitting in the oval office right now.

Of course I would be very surprised if the got the nomination even though he is way more than able.

</quote>

What "transgressions"? Clinton got a blowjob. That's it.

Reagan made a deal with Iran to get elected and funded terrorists that raped and killed American nuns.

Bush II lied about Iraq. And completely lied about it. Killed thousands.

Those are REAL transgression.

Nothing will happen to either man.

</quote>

The transgressions I was referring to were Obstruction of Justice and Perjury. This guy was a sitting POTUS. Don't know about you but I expect a bit more from the supreme leader of America.

As for his blowjob? I could care if he blew every intern in DC.

Clintons morals or lack thereof don't bother me one bit. Just as Newts don't. Clintons not the first Prez nor will he be the last to chase skirts. Or blowjobs.
