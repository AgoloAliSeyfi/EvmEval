Well said good sir well said. Amazing how nearly everyone on this thread failed to acknoledge this and accused labour of being the main cause when in fact it was well out of there juristinction. At least labor didn't sit about and let the situation get worse they actually give it a really good shot in tackiling the problem against neigh impossible odds. The coaltion wouldnt of been able to last 5 minutes in that situation yet labour lasted a lot longer than everyone thought. The labour party clearly knew what it was doing and despite there mistakes they always kept on the ball.

Labours realistic and they look out for the little people they wouldn't even make cuts at an alarming fast rate like the coalition is. That alone is screaming failure and disaster not to mention the countess embarrassment this will cause them and the people who follow the coalition.

When Labour gets back into power which will be very soon because the coalition is already allowing Labour to do that with the savage draconian cuts and carrying them out way way to quickly.

Give it a little while and you will be seeing new elections being called sooner than the 5 years as with the coalitions bad decisions there's only so much the pubic is willing to take. Let the coalition seal there own fates as all those who supported the coalition and blamed Labour will soon disown the coalition.

Why is it when ever anything goes wrong in the coalition Labour get brought into it and always mentioned even though they have no involvement in the coalitions decisions?

Its not surprising Labour where in power for over 10 years especially since the torys are doing now what they did in the 80's which is what got them voted out in the first place.Youd think they would of learned from there mistakes yet they haven't. That alone is making them a laughing stock not to mention the future implications and backfires there decisions will end up causing them. Even if they stay in for 5 years they will be gone regardless now.

It's amazing how some people will forgive Labour for literally anything (such as bankrupting the UK on more than one occasion), yet will never forget the past when it comes to the Conservatives, refusing outright the thought of giving them a chance.
