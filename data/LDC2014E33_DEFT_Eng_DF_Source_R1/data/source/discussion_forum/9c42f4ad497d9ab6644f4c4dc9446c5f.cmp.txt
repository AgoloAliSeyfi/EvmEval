And learn what? They haven't been involved in any wars in recent memory, aren't threatening any except for Taiwan, which is sort of a unique situation.

They project their their strength economically, and yes we should be concerned. Because they're out competing us. They are currently making massive inroads into Africa. They could well be the defacto owners of much of that continent within two decades, and all it's resources. They're doing quite well and I expect we'll learn to coexist rather than fight.

I fail to see what China could possibly gain from a war. They aren't the boogeyman. At least, not in the military sense.
