I wrote on my Tumblr what I think the cause of the Riots was

I’m making this blog because I didn’t feel that long blocks of text and my thoughts and feelings on world events is what my followers on that blog would enjoy, so that’s what this blog will be about. My first blog post being directed towards the current rioting in the UK, as you may have guessed by now. I hope to explain why I think that this is happening without simply labelling all the people involved as thugs or animals, no matter how un-necessary I feel this violence actually is.

Now as most of you know what started this off is the shooting of Mark Duggan by police. The events which unfolded over last week are still very unclear but peaceful protesters took to the streets in Tottenham on Saturday to demand answers. As the night drew on without answers tension in the ‘mob’ now grew and after rumours of the beating of a 16 year old girl by police had got out the protesters had enough. The peace then turned into a larger riot with burning of various houses, we’ll get to why it went so far later.

Now it’s important to note the riots of Sunday, Monday and tonight (Tuesday) had very little to do with the shooting of Mark Duggan. There are many speculations as to why these are occurring; When asked by various media sources youths gave different responses. “…the older generations don’t respect us youth so as soon as you respect us we’ll respect us back…”-BBC News “..I’m taking my taxes back..” - Mark Stone YouTube “…We’re showing the police we can do what we want… we’re also showing the rich,who’s businesses these are, that we can do what we want…” - BBC News. Now ignoring how uneducated one of those responses is it seems that the rioters believe they’re acting on some sort of social divide which has formed in the UK. The split between Adults and Teenagers and the ongoing social divide between the rich and the poor and highlighting the severity of the unequal distribution of wealth in the UK. It should have been easy to predict that the youth would show distaste towards todays government; the rise in university fees, the 75% cuts to Youth Club funding and many Arts courses being cut. The disadvantaged rightly feel that they are getting more oppurtunities taken away from them and they feel let down by the government.

However that still doesn’t explain just exactly why these feelings turn into riots, looting, arson and other such outstanding acts of violence. Well I looked into the mindset behind the mob, what drives rioters… and found an extremely interesting theory of ’Deindividuation’.

<a href="http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/02/10/deindividuation/">http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/02/10/deindividuation/</a>

What this study shows is that when there are a large amount of people together and there’s a strong feeling of anonymity a hive-mind effect takes place. If the large crowd has a similar feeling; be that tension, anger, disappointment, resentment etc. and one or two members of the crowd begin to instigate these feelings each individual in the crowd begins to lose sense of who they are and what kind of individual they are. The link I posted talks about crowds telling someone to jump from a building to commit suicide and getting people in the crowd to act completely out of character. So when a large group gets together with friends and one or maybe two of the natural leaders instigate violence it can quickly turn into full fledged violence.

There are also acts of conformity going into play with a lot of people giving into peer pressure to their friends. Some people aren’t as lucky as you or I and if all they have in their lives are their friends and they ask them to go cause a ****storm in the city with them they’ll most likely give in.

Hopefully after reading that you’ll agree that not all of the people involved in the rioting are evil people or animals. They are simply people who share feelings of resentment towards their government and lose themselves as an individual during large crowds.
However I do severely hope that parents prove to be good and will ensure that any items found to be looted are returned to the respective shops and that they punish their children appropriately.

It's possible this is a false flag event.

ie populace end up giving away more civil liberties in exchange for more government in their lives

Maybe, but I'm certain the whole how-the-government-and-police-handled-the-riots situation and global economy isn't what it seems. At all.

They're quite clearly not taking part in the riots, they're on the civilian side of the police wall (hence the officers facing them are in normal attire and not riot gear)

Very droll, I'm surprised people still bite on these "'X' are gay." comments.
