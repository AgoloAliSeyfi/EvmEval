Well then, why is it a HATE CRIME when a White person does it to a Black but not a HATE CRIME when it's the other way around?

Why is the title of your thread so insidious? Why not a title lie "School Officials Screw over Rape Victim?"

That one would be more accurate.

Because this is not Your Thread to name. Works for me.

And that question Wasn't Directed At You. Works for me.

Not only did 4 Blacks rape this girl, the main perp only received ANGER MANAGEMENT class with no jail time!

The girl was just 16, a cheerleader at Silsbee High School in Texas. She was at a party in 2008 when football star Rakheem Bolton, fellow player Christian Roundtree and another boy pushed her into a bedroom and locked the door, held her down, and sexually assaulted her...

When others tried to enter the room, Bolton and Roundtree jumped out a window, leaving their clothes behind.

The girl filed charges, but that didn't put an end to her trauma. Sphincteric school superintendent Richard Bain Jr. would make sure it only got worse.

When the girl returned to school, administrators decided the best course of action was for the girl to slink away in a corner and try not to be seen. They told her to avoid the cafeteria and not take part in homecoming. Out of sight, out of mind.

The kids were all teenagers, and the sex was claimed to be consensual.

I have no idea whether it was, and neither does anyone of this forum.

So yes, the title of this thread does kind of bend reality.
