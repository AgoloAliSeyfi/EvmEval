So let me return to bringing other people's impressions again instead..:

An otherwise deliriously raving Guardian editorial on Blair's speech also notes that:

<quote>
<a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1881867,00.html">The long goodbye</a>

[..] The prime minister steered clear of the things that have gone wrong with his government, though these include episodes so significant that they will determine how he is seen by history. An undercurrent of evasiveness has run through his premiership and it was evident again yesterday when he asserted "terrorism isn't our fault. We didn't cause it". That slippery claim is not entirely true of Iraq and he would have strengthened his case had he shown a little humility. He also talked of a country that was "aching for change" in 1997 but did not admit that, from honours to the environment, his government's record has not always matched those hopes. His belated conversion to the benefits of regulation (green restrictions on business, on the advertising of junk food) was notable, as was his confusion over whether this was "old" or "new" labour.

And Simon Hoggart remains more down-to-earth from the start, and fillets Blair's speech in his own, anecdotal way:

<quote>
<a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/backbench/comment/0,,1881912,00.html">I'm right, you're wrong, and the voters know it...</a>

Sketch
Simon Hoggart

[..] The speech was well-delivered, and well-received, but it was classic Blair. He could have delivered chunks at any time in the past 12 years. The gist was, as it generally is: "I'm right, you're wrong, and the voters know it." On education, reforming the NHS, identity cards and even Iraq he read them a crisp and businesslike lecture. There were the usual verb-free sentences - 79 in all - which in the past implied commitments without making promises. Now they evoke achievements that may or may not have occurred: "The end of waiting in the NHS. Historic. Transforming secondary schools... Historic."

And there were those clunking sentences that make you ask what on earth he could possibly mean, though you haven't time to work it out because the speech has swept on. "The USP of New Labour is aspiration and compassion reconciled." Eh? "Ten years ago, if we talked pensions, we meant pensioners." What was that about? "The danger is failing to understand that New Labour in 2007 won't be New Labour in 1997." Sorry, run that past me again. "Ten years on, our advantage is time, our disadvantage, time." Lost me there, old cock. [..]

The organisers tried to whip up a frenzy which was almost, but not quite there. Before he arrived there was a "spontaneous" demonstration in which members of the audience held up hand-written posters: "We love you, yeah, yeah, yeah", "Too young to retire" and simply "Thank you". It was like waiting for a very cuddly version of Stalin. We saw a video in which ordinary folk and celebrities gave thanks for the existence of Blair. One old lady said: "I'm grateful for the Â£200 fuel allowance - it's better than a woolly hat." And they claim the British have a poverty of ambition! [..]

On a complete and trivial aside, by the way, Hoggart notes something else too, which had already struck me as just so silly:

<quote>
Then he arrived and ran to the podium. Party leaders have to run now, to show how fit they are.

Here's a photo to go with that observation:

Does anyone else find this totally toecurling? I mean - my immediate gut reaction: act your age, man! Dont you realise how much of a fool you're making of yourself? Respect yourself, dont act like a parody.

Oh, fer crying out loud..

<a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourconference2006/story/0,,1882122,00.html">Blair may delay exit, says Johnson</a>

Alan Johnson suggested today that Tony Blair might stay in office for longer than expected following his triumphant conference speech yesterday.
Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether Mr Blair's departure date was now "further away than some people thought when they came to Manchester", the education secretary responded: "Oh, well, I think so.

"I mean if the prime minister says, 'I want to use the rest of my time to try to resolve the Middle East problem in the same way as we tried to tackle the Northern Ireland problem,' I think it suggests he's not talking about a couple of weeks; it's a big problem."
