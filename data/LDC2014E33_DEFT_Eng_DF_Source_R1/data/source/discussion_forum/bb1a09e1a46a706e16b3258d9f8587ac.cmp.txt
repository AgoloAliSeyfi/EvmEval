I really want to have this baby without meds, the epidural didnt work for me when I had dd, I just have no idea how to cope with the pain. All the birthing classes around here are waaaay overpriced, and my friend said all they tell you is to breathe alot lol. So I'm asking you ladies <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/> if youve had a natural birth, how did you make it through? If youre planning a natural birth, what techniques are you going to try?

My midwives recommended "pregnancy, childbirth, and the newborn" by penny simkin. It was very thorough and detailed out all sorts of options as well as positions and breathing for pain relief. I felt well prepared after reading it. Ina may Gaskin's book is really good inspiration, too. Lots of good stories to get you psyched up!

Also, the website "the childbirth connection" is pretty connected to the first book and has good planning worksheets.

I didn't get to put any of this into too much practice, but it was helpful in he labor I had (which was moving FAST and hard), and was very much recommended for natural labor.

My doula was my savior. I had back labor with Marshall and she applied a ton of counter pressure during contractions and then did a lower back massage between the contractions.

Focus on something else, anything else but the pain. Try to put yourself into a "zen" state, keep telling yourself this doesn't last forever, you can make it through it. If you have water available, get in the water!!!

Have only people around you that support what your doing. If in the hospital, tell the nurses to hush about pain relief or a epi unless YOU ask for it, not to offer it to you.

I had a totally drug free birth with Marshall and it was amazing. Transition was tough (the very end where the contractions are coming in waves without a break) but overall, it was amazing. I didn't feel pain when I was pushing him out (it felt good to push), I didn't feel when I tore either (2nd degree). I was up and back to doing my regular routine 2-3 days (grocery shopping on day 3). The day after he was born, I was taking care of my husband who got a fluke ear infection and was running a high fever and miserable.

I really liked the book "Ina Mays Guide to Childbirth". The first half is nothing but birth stories and the second half gets into the more technical details of things...

They key for me was redirecting the focus off of the pain and not laying flat on my back. When my water broke the contractions came fast and furious but because I hadn't packed a bag yet, I started walking around and cleaning and packing. The contracts got worse and worse but my mind was on getting to the hospital. I walked into the hospital not being able to talk anymore but because the next mission was to get myself into L&amp;D I focused on that. Then it was to get my clothes off and so on. It wasn't until I laid down on my back that it got really bad. I honestly think it's because being on your back is a terrible position to squeeze out a baby and secondly the only thing I was now focusing on was the pain from having a baby. The other thing that helped was my husband just being there to hold my hand and do everything I said. Sounds bossy but when I needed him to just sit next to me silence or take off my gown he did exactly that and that was comforting to me.
