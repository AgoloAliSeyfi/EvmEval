they have a very different perspective on gun rights than here in the UK and you must bare this in mind, it is enshrined in their constitution whilst we have no such right.
secondly when you say carry do you mean literally walk down the street with one in your pocket or the right to have them in your home? because again two very different concepts... not many states allow people to walk down the street with a gun in their pocket and you need a license in the vast majority of cases to do that anyway.
as for legalising them... well guns are just a tool like a knife they're not solely and limited to killing people you dislike, i my self very much enjoy full bore target shooting and the occasional bit of skeet, just because some people use guns for the wrong reasons should people like me who use them for legitimate safe reasons be punished? no... by the logic youll end up banning knives, irons, cars, large sticks etc.

as for your statistics and the point you make if someones going to kill someone else and they have their mind set on it theyre going to do it with or without a firearm, the fact guns are so accesable their just means that they will be the weapon of choice for such acts... if there werent people would be using knives and the like more... p lus you must consider the USA has a significantly bigger population than us so their murder rate relative is bound to be higher and finally again you must consider the implications of culture, they have a far bigger problem with gangs and gang related violence and such than we do.

and as for your last point i dont believe its gun companies lobbying that keeps it open, its peoples wishes to have their right to bare arms kept to them and not withdrawn.

I believe that getting a license is really quite easy though...

And the 'rate' means per 100,000 so that takes into account the population differences.

I understand the requirement for guns in farming and some recreational activities but people are allowed to have guns out of those requirements far too easily in the United States.

This suggests to me that it is not guns that are the problem but that it's social inequality.

and I agree, but all the while that there are large numbers of poor and/or disenfranchised people, I say keep the guns away from them

From your own article.

"An agreement was made in September 2008 whereby the short-listed British Olympic pistol team for the 2012 Olympics was to be granted short-term Section 5 exceptions and be allowed to import their pistols and store them at a certain, secure site for the duration of the games."

Yes there are exceptions. But for all intents and purposes for the vast majority of the British general public firearms are illegal.
If you don't believe try and buy a legal handgun tomorrow.

As crazy as it seems, the reason that American govt is unable to impose any sort of gun control laws on the American people is because of a little thing called the second amendment. It's in the constitution which is the highest law in the US. It can never be changed.

The reason for the second amendment was to allow the people to defend themselves against their own government.

What's an amendment then?

This is more about a question I had, rather than a debate as such.

So the number of deaths by shootings in the United States is around 40 times higher than in the UK (USA: 4.1 per 100,000 compared to UK: 0.07 per 100,000) and the total murder rate is also 4 times higher (USA: 4.8 per 100,000 compared to UK: 1.2 per 100,000)...

So how the hell can countries like the USA continue to legalise carrying firearms?! It just seems completely absurd to me.

Forgive me if my thinking is over-simplistic; that guns lead to murders. Clearly if you don't have to access to a gun, you'd use another method and that's reflected in the statistics...but surely the fact that there are 4 times as many murders in the USA is, at least, partly attributable to guns?

Is it just political pressure from gun companies that keeps them legalised?

carrying a gun is just one of the rights in the usa. it is an acceptable way of protecting oneself according to the constitution. couldn't ever see that happening in the uk though.

Switzerland is an exception - in most countries where guns are legalised, the murder rate is higher. More guns = correlation in murder rate.

Ok how about austria?
They've got way more guns than us yet their murder rate is half that of the UK,in fact shotguns are available over the counter for anyone over 18.

As I said, there are a few exceptions and outliers, but generally there is a very strong positive correlation.

I'm not saying that they aren't unavailable to the vast majority of people, merely that your initial statement that they are completely banned is simply wrong. <img src="images/smilies/colondollar.gif"/>
