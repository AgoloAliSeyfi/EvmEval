I am so shocked that republicans can treat one of there own in such a way as they have regarding mitt. i am a registered democrat. i intend to vote for mitt. I like obama but am not sure he can get things done. I am also a member of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints. i know that this is an issue for alot of americans but can not understand why? why should it matter? this is why we live in a free country. mitt is the only candidate who can win. stop all the negative ads (Newt) you are just giving amunition to obama. I am sure he is just relaxing and lauphing while all of you are fighting. get over it and think about what is at stake. grow up. and get behind him. nixon was a quaker, kennady was a catholic. remember separation of church and state!!!!! mitt will not try to convert all of you. he just wants what is best for the country.
OH and you evangelicals, if you are really christian then act like it. stop spreading fear and hate!!!!

Good tell all your friends to vote for him too. Bashing Romney does not have anything to do with his religion for most. This is a primary, primaries get ugly, and itll make the candidate stronger in the end if its Mitt most Republicans will support him

Exactly. If I were Mitt I'd be embarrassed by McCain and Sununu out there calling Newt a big meany.

Makes Mitt look like a cupcake.

I'm a Romney supporter. I don't think Newt has earned back any of his lost support with his attacks. I think if his ads make people back away from Romney their votes will go to Santorum or Paul or maybe Huntsman, not Newt.

But for the most part I think it's good that Romney is taking the heat now... so there are no surprises later and because I think it will prepare him for the showdown with Obama.

i agree with you but can't understand why Newt is such a cry baby. he is the one who wants to dish it out but can't take it. Oh and being a conservative ? Throws Clinton under the bus while having an affair. that just shows him to lack character when this is what we need most.

Romney threw down the gauntlet. I'm not watching Newt cry. I'm watching Newt give Romney back a knuckle sandwich.

Mitt went heavy negative first. It's game on now.

And Newt by the way had to pursue Clinton for purgery. It had nothing to do with an affair.

And actually, Newt defended Clinton's bombings in retaliation for the attacks on the embassies when everyone else was running around saying President Clinton was just trying to deflect from having to testify.

Tens of Millions Spent to Target Newt Gingrich

<quote>
By Gary Cohen

of the Iowa caucuses, well-funded so-called super PACs are using the political clout given to them by the nation's highest court in an unprecedented tour de financial force.

Data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics indicates 264 super PACs have raised more than $32 million and spent almost $16 million in the 2012 election cycle thus far, The Hill reports.

The lion's share of the money those groups have spent has targeted former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, according to The Hill. The impact in Iowa is clear: Iowa voters are being reminded repeatedly about Gingrich's ties to Freddie Mac, his divorces, and his lengthy Capitol Hill career.

"This is politics" former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney said last week when he reacted to calls for him to condemn attack ads run by the group Restore Our Future.

The Huffington Post points out that those were part of a $3.3 million negative ad campaign waged by the group against Gingrich.

Candidates with enough financial clout are able to lay their own groundwork to mobilize voters and remain positive while the super PACS continue to run negative ads, the Huffington Post reports.

Campaign finance observers have been concerned that empowered by the January 2010 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing independent groups to raise and spend unlimited money, such groups would change the balance of campaigns dramatically. In the past the political battlefield has been overseen by political party organizations and candidate committees.

According to a Huffington Post analysis of independent expenditures thus far this election cycle, super PACs have combined to spend $11 million in the Republican primaries, including at least $5.8 million in Iowa alone.

I've got no dog in this hunt Amelia and I'm loving the battle.

If your man comes out as the candidate not one person can ever, ever say it was a coronation or he got it on a silver platter.

He will have come thru hell and high water to have earned it.
