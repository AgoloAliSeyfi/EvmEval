This is the same exact line that's been proven wrong on several levels.

The bombs did not make Japan change its conditions for surrender. At. All.

Straight up LIE. Before the bombs Japan wanted us to agree to a cease fire and a return to our 1941 start lines. They wanted no foreign presence in Japan, no Change of Government and no change of the Military. After the first bomb they still tried to make demands they want 4 things only one of which was the Emperor. After 2 bombs and a Soviet declaration of War they agreed to surrender and WE agreed to let them keep their Emperor as a FIGURE head only. The final surrender was UNCONDITIONAL. As evidenced by the Documents the Japanese signed.

You have yet to provide us with all the supposed surrender attempts by Japan in 1945. You keep making the claim but provide absolutely no evidence of such.

There is nothing that can be posted that you would pay attention to unless it appeared to re-affirm your pre-maturely developed position. I've already posted evidence that you flat out ignore but demand more......

You have made a claim, that Japan offered to Surrender in 1945 NUMEROUS times before either bomb was dropped. PROVE it. The ONLY offer they ever made was through the Soviets and that was not a surrender it was a cease fire with a pullback to the 1941 Line for all sides. And according to this offer nothing else would be done to the Japanese.

After the first bomb was dropped they made an offer with 4 demands. We rejected it. After the second bomb and the Soviet Declaration of War and Invasion Japan's Emperor ordered an immediate surrender with no Conditions. The Allies accepted and changed the term to keeping the Emperor as a FIGURE head. Japan surrendered unconditionally.

You are now engaged in the immorality of stubbornness. Your assertion has flatly been disproved. You can't admit it, which says very poorly about your character.

</quote>

Flatly disproved? Lol....you have ignored the government link I posted showing Japan's offer of a surrender on one condition and we accepted. But you keep on ignoring that..........hell.....you don't even attempt to support your claims like saying all the top military leaders were wrong for saying the bomb was not necessary.
