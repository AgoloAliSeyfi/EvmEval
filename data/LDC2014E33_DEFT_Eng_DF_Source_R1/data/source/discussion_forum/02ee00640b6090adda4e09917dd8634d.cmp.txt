So I am sure you all heard of his speech in which he said if Republicans didn't pass his Bill Murder and Rapes would go up. In that speech he claimed the Murder Rate in Flint Michigan had more than Doubled already.

False it is down 11%.

He pointed out that Flint had, had to lay off some cops, which is true, but he left out the most important fact.

Flint was in Negotiations with the Police UNION, they wanted them to take a small Cut in their benefit Program in order to Avoid any lay Offs. As Unions usually do, they chose keeping their Benefits at the level they are, over keeping Cops on the Job, and the Lay offs happened. However despite the layoffs Murder and Rape are still down 11% in Flint.

Is this to be SOP for the Democrat Party for now on? Propose a Whole Shit load of spending, then Claim opposition to that new spending is "cutting Jobs" and causing people to be raped and Murdered? Democrats should be ashamed of this Administration and their Hyper Partisan, Dishonest, Fear Mongering.

Less cops - more murder and rapes.

Why is that so hard to understand?

Joe Biden Lied through his teeth and claimed Rape was up 100% in Flint when it's down 11%

Why is that so hard to understand?

Flint laid off Police officers because the Union Refused to accept any Cuts and chose their Benefits over avoiding Layoffs.

Why is that so hard to understand?

Think it's going to stay that way with less police? Heck..maybe there are less police to report crimes to so people are like, why bother?

And why should cops have to accept less benefits? So they can cut taxes for overpaid rich folks?

A bad economy and fewer jobs WILL almost certainly cause more crime and strife. Fox Poop. Link?

And Yet Violent Crime is Down Substantially right now in the middle of a Bad Economy. Go Figure.

Why did Biden try to panic Americans by saying that rape statistics would rise if Obama's jobs bill wasn't passed? Is he a fool who isn't aware that violent rape incidents are going down or is he a lying bastard who doesn't give a damn?

In a word, YES.
