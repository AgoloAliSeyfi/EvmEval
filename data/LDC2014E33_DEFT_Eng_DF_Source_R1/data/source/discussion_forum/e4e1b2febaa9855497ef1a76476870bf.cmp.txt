It really worries me that the current generation of students, who will be the future of this country, when faced with the prospect of having to work slighter harder in life, instead decided to throw a big hissy fit in London. Pretty much sums up the work ethic of young British people.

how can you afford half a trillion to give to banks but cant fund education.

We can't afford to do that, but if its that (even though £500bn is a number you've just made up), but the alternative of sending RBS, HBOS, B&amp;B and Northern Rock account holders to the wall (ignoring any possible contagion) then there wasn't all that much choice of politicians.

'Is the new tuition fee fairer?'

Most people seem to be arguing about whether the graduates themselves are better or worse off under this system than the previous, which is a whole different question. In terms of this issue, almost all graduates will pay less for their degrees under this new system than under the previous system. It is that simple.

In terms of fairness, as less of the cost of the degrees will be payed by graduates, there will be a higher cost to the taxpayer which, as this group doesn't only include graduates, means more of the cost will be paid by those who do not have degrees (tending on average to be the poorer parts of the society) than under the previous system. In this regard it is clearly less fair for precisely the same reason that it makes graduates better off.

People are also arguing about the way education is payed for more generally and not just in terms of comparing this system and the previous system. Now, when it comes to the state (or really the public) paying for a degree in whole or in part, the question here is whether people think that for some reason students, who nearly all seem to come from middle class or upper class backgrounds, deserve to have their education payed for in part by taxing those people who are poorer than they are, and who didn't themselves get to go to university ( and with regards to the issue of access for those who are from poorer sections of society, the issue isn't really the cost of the degrees, but the fact that many people in poorer areas are failed terribly by the education system earlier on ). Often enough you hear people saying that everyone should contribute towards people going to university because of the economic benefits brought to the whole country by having a better educated population - similarly I may argue that if I had a house it would benefit my neighbours if I had it improved (maybe repainted, something added to it, a professional garderner or something) as it would help to improve the neighbourhood and could even improve the value of neighbouring houses, but it would be ridiculous to suggest that my neighbours should therefore contribute to my costs in doing this.

Re the bit in bold,

* Prior to 1997, university education was free, therefore people like the current policy makers and the previous generation got it for free, with no debt/tax system for the rest of their working life
* in other developed countires in the world, university is either free or relatively low cost (I personally dont think university should be free, it should have a cost, but £9000 per year is absolutley disgraceful)

so when the bankers fukk up its alright to fork out 500billion to fix their little mistake, but in times of relative harmony education cant be free????

during the world war we managed to build the nhs and a welfare system and later the minimum wage.

these kleptomaniac criminal bankers havent even been held accountable, something is wrong with this country and we need only look in the mirror.

Yes there is advantages to the NHS and the welfare system, not so much with the minimum wage though.
