it means the choice doesnt go beyond you, your husband (or man you are with) and your doctor. Nobodies else's opinion matter.
I dont care what the Dem party has invested in abortion. The Choice is not yours to make unless it concerns you. My life does and never will concern you. If my wife and i decided we didnt want the child at this moment and went the abortion route, it is our choice.

I dont need to ask your permission, nor hear your opinion on it. If you felt you needed to state or stop us, i would not be above just decking you.
Stay out of other people's personal affairs. I dont give a shit if you get hit by a bus tomorrow, your life is meaningless to me, and if you choose to keep or abort a child has no impact on me whatsoever.

This is MY opinion and stance, Not a progressive, not a liberal, nor a democrat policy. They do not speak for me, just like you will never choose what i can and can not do with my body.

How are you a hypocrite? Answer these for me.

Are you against government removing transfats?
Smoking bans?
and other nannystate type situations?

See someone like you is for making a law banning all Abortions. You want to use government to limit peoples rights and freedoms. You will say its for the children blah blah, but the reality is you want your morals imposed on others.

Oh, this is going to be EASY!

I can destroy you by pointing out one little fact.

IT WAS LIBERALS THAT MADE A FEDERAL LAW "BANNING." Not social conservatives.

You see before Roe v. Wade, each state had their own laws on abortion IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 10TH AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION.

It was not until Roe v. Wade when the "Jane Roe" (who later admitted she lied about being raped) went to the USSC and the USSC VIOLATED THE 10TH AMENDMENT making a federal law from the bench.

Thus, liberals BANNED THE RIGHT OF THE STATES TO DECIDE ON THIS QUESTION, which is their legal right per the 10th Amendment.

Over turning the Unconstitutional, Roe v. Wade bans nothing. It simply RETURNS THE QUESTION TO THE STATES, where it resided before 1973.

Thus, your argument about my "hypocrisy" falls flat because it's built on your OWN IGNORANCE regarding the Constitution and the origins of Roe v. Wade.

That also collapses your "it doesn't go beyond you or your husband."

No, sorry. The question goes TO THE STATES as noted in the 10th Amendment.

You want to try again, and make it even more obvious how badly you just lost on that issue?

you seriously have to be one of the most stupidest fucks ever to walk this earth.
This wasnt a state right issue you fucking waste of air. this was about your personal belief that YOU would create a law banning Abortion.
Liberals didnt ban abortion you motherfucking twat, which is what we are talking about. Not your pathetic attempt to move to goal posts like you always fucking do in your attempt to debate people.
This is why nobody ever talks to you. You just move your argument around in circles never actually landing on a point.
if i could time travel i would go back in time and pay your parents not to have you, and thus saving the world of your stupidity.
