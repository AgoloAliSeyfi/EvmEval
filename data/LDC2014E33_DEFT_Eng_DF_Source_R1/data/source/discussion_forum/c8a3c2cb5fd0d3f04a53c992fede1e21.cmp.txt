Not a Government issue. Time to get the Government out of the bedroom. No more having it both ways. The Government doesn't belong being involved with such private personal matters. And they definitely shouldn't be forcing anyone to pay for someone else's Contraception &amp; Abortions. Taxpayers are not required to fund fellow Citizens' personal sexual behavior. It's the individual Citizens' responsibility to fund their own behavior. You want to be promiscuous and have several Abortions? Well then you have to take personal responsibility and fund that behavior yourself. It's not your fellow Citizens' responsibility to do that. Big Government needs to be booted out of these personal social issues. They're clearly over-reaching now.

I find this issue rather interesting myself. The left yells and holler that they demand government to stay out of the bedroom and "private affairs" with respect to Defense Of Marriage Act and same sex marriage, yet they really don't want government out of the bedroom because the left is now trying everything to connect contraception with the notion that it's somehow a HEALTH issue. It's not a health issue in the respect that mamograms are, it's just another "give me, give me" entitlement.
What exactly entitles government to give you free contraception, to in effect have taxpayers PAY for your extracurricular activities?

Health insurance should be treated with various cover options with everyone that seeks to have health care coverage paying for BASIC services. If you want the cadillac option that includes free contraception, free viagra, free gym membership and weight loss programs, etc. then that individual must pay for the added individual premium coverage for those desired programs. Government should stay out of issues such as these, period. It's not the Federal Government's job to be and act as the "responsible" parent, because some complaining entitlement supporters choose not to be.

Contraception is about family planning, not about wild sex. You can have wild sex without contraception. It is in the interest of the society that unwanted children be kept to a minimum. It reduces the abortion rate, the number of children born to single mothers and the burden on society

As such, government has the right to require insurance companies, which make a tremendous amount of money off of our society to include contraceptive coverage. We tried to implement a government insurance option and insurance companies spent billions to block it. This is part of their payback

Most contraception is used by married couples who are trying to responsibly control the number of children they have. It is not about wild sex parties and sticking it where you want.......it's about responsible parenting

If insurance will pay for a vasectomy or tubal litigation....what is the moral opposition to birth control?

</quote>

Insurance will pay for those because it's cheaper than the costs associated with a baby. It's an economic decision for the insurance company not a moral one

</quote>

If it is dictated by the government it is not an economic decision, it is a political one.
