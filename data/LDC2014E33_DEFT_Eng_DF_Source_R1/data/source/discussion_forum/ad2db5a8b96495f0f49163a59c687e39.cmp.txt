There are nuts in the White House that want 0 nukes, I've seen them up close.

The point is lowering our nuke levels with promises from Russia is stupid when we end up with less nukes than China and Russia in addition to NK. It is a numbers game that you don't want to be inferior for survival.

If the Russia-China alliance thingy ever comes back someday, we'd be screwed.

Obamination said he hopes to get rid of all nukes someday.

That is the plan....to slowly get rid of them. He lowered the numbers soon as getting into office and wa-laa he now wants more cuts.....huge cuts. Shocking..... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

Worst case scenario (for you anyway) ends with us having 300 deployed nukes, is that not enough? How about 700? how about the 1550 we have now? Or the thousands of others we could assemble in short order? What is an acceptable number for you? Your love of these obscene weapons is pretty damned creepy. There is no way we will ever have zero nukes, quit worrying about that.

The cold war is over, the need for a balance of terror is not as acute and we could store them in a way where they could be called into service quickly if an arms race ever heated up, keep a few hundred ready and be no worse off except we save several hundred billion dollars a year. There is no way on earth we need to keep 1550 nukes ready at all times, it's a waste. I would love to live in a world where there are no nukes but it's not going to happen, if we are stuck with them I would prefer a program that matches the actual threat, not paranoid fantasies.

Shut the fuck up, idiot.

SLBMs are not replacing ICBMs, we still have 3 missile wings located in WY,ND and MT. SLBMs serve a different purpose than ICBMs in our overall scheme which you don't have a clue about, cleatus.

The rest of your ALCMs and SIOP rundown is..... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

Dumbass....the ICBM force is pretty cost efficient. The weapons last for decades and require minimum maintenance compared to tanks, ships and airplanes.

They are the biggest bang for the buck and have kept your sorry ass protected ever since you started sucking O2.

ICBM's are being replaced by SLBM's. Cruise missiles are the best course. The launch of an ICBM would be immediately detected. And weapons launched from the former Soviet Union would hit the US FIRST even if launched a short time LATER. (ROTATION OF THE EARTH). We need marine based SLBM's and cruise missiles, NOT ICBM's.
*********************************************
"Additionally, ICBMs are generally considered to be nuclear only; although several conceptual designs of conventionally-armed missiles have been considered, the launch of such a weapon would be such a threat that it would demand a nuclear response, eliminating any military value to such a weapon."
*********************************************
Any general in the US who says NUTS to reducing ICBM's needs to RETIRE or be in a mental health facility.

You seem, uh, DISTRESSED by facts BEZERK. I brought up SLBM's &amp; cruise missiles which ARE are primary nuclear weapons. The focus now however, is on cyber attacks. Catch up on your reading. Or have someone read about recent technology to you.

Sorry that some of us in life and done things you don't know about....like flown a jet, been in a submarine, worked with nukes, etc, etc.

Sure you did and I'm sure you can prove it too. Right?

You don't want to believe others when they talk about their service. Why should anyone here take your word for it?
