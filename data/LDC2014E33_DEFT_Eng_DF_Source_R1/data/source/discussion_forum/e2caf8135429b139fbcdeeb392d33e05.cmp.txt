Respectfully, I have investigated over 1000 cases for trial in 30 years. The jury is charged on the law and in this case material fact was the free speech 1st Amendment protection. That is a jury decision as to the facts:
State v. Howell "The jury must beleft perfectly free in reaching a conclusion upon the testimony introduced, untrammeled by any intimidation from the judge as to whether a certain fact at issue has been proved or not"
Concerning the 1st Amendment Constitutional argument and jury charges by a judge:
Norris v. Clinkscales "A judge violates this provision when he expresses in his charge his own opinion upon the force and effect of the testimony, or any part of it, or intimates his views of the sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence, in whole or in part.
Under the Constitution the force and effect, or weight and sufficiency, of testimony and facts must be left exclusively to the jury, uninfluenced by any expression or intimation of opinion on The First Amendment or any other Amendment.

Right. The jury has full power over questions of fact, of evidence and testimony, weight and credibility. The judge can't influence them in any way over that.

This is different from questions of law. For example, the jury doesn't decide whether an objection is sustained or overruled. They don't decide what evidence is admissible. They don't decide what the law says, they are told what it says and they are to determine the facts exactly as you have described and apply those to the law as they are instructed by the judge in order to reach a conclusion.

What types of speech are covered by the First Amendment is not a question of fact for a jury to determine. It's settled law that is to be determined by the judge and then the jury instructed as to what speech is and is not protected and under what circumstances. They then go over all the facts, evidence and testimony and decide whether those facts as they determine them fit the law as they were instructed.

We are on the same page. I know the rules of evidence. You fail to understand they were already PAST that when this went totrial.
The jury was charged on the law.
What IS free speech is a judicial decision and that is where they are now,only after appeal. But the Constitution, where the 1st Amendment is, does not allow judcial interpretation AT TRIAL on issues of material facts IN evidence.
That is a jury issue.

Did you read Jury Instruction 21 in the 4th Circuit opinion? If not you should. To paraphrase (there's a link in one of my earlier posts on page 2, I think) the jury was simply told the level of protection varies on the type of speech, with no instruction on what the levels are or what types do and do not receive protection.

And yet the level of protection for different types of speech is a matter of law, not fact. So the jury was in fact given a question of law to determine - the judge did not spell out the law but left it up to the jury to decide what is and is not protected speech. See the problem here?

I think an SC ruling on where speech becomes harassment might be helpful though. I dunno. It's a very, very hard one. I don't want free speech curtailed, but I also loathe the actions of these guys.... and those that harass women going into abortion clinics. There are better ways to speak your mind than to scream like banshees at ordinary people going about their private business.

The case before the court would not allow that sort of finding from the facts, because the family never saw, or heard, Phelps and his church. I would think that harassment has to be immediate before it is actionable.

They heard it after the fact Quantum. Harm seems to have been established in the lower courts. I think drawing a bystander into a political speech for your benefit and the other private party's harm is the key here.

I agree with you, Quantum Windbag, and so do most legal commentators I have read. There doesn't seem to be any novel con law question presented on these facts and it's a puzzler why the SCOTUS took the cert.

Have you read the 4th Circuit opinion and the transcript of yesterday's questioning? It seems the Court is looking at whether the 4th Circuit was correct in disregarding the public v. private nature of the individuals and event and focusing on the type of speech instead. There's also a side issue of amicus waivers. Interesting stuff if you haven't looked at it.

The attorney for the church is the daughter of the nut case pastor.
The public v. private nature is THE argument for the church as the ruling in the Jerry Fallwell v. Hustler case is what they are hanging their entire argument on.
How they can claim the father of the soldier is a public figure is absurd. That is the entire case. The father IS NOT a public figure and is a private citizen.
The jury verdict must stand.

I think you have that backward. Snyder is the one pinning his whole case on the public/private division, and the news about that funeral was very public. The family even invited the Patriot Guard, making it even more public.
