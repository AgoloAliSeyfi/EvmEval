Rant of the day? Who's got a better one?

I would like to thank you for proving my point. Corporatism? Gramm-Leach-Blilely?
Nope.
Just as your ThoughtMasters told you to do!

Thanks! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/clap2.gif"/>

How many times are you going to post the same tripe pretending like it's factual? You purport to know what OWS is all about. Guess what, there is no concise belief system of OWS. There are so many divergent point of views, there is no way to actually begin to discuss the 'movement' in an intelligent, logical manner.

You can re-post all the points of legitimate contention over and over. However, when the vast majority of the movement has been an uncivilized assault on the rest of society peppered with vapid chants, you're not going to convince anyone that it has any more substance than a teenager's temper tantrum.

Crony capitalism has been on the fore front of political debate for at least a few years now. And it got there without any of the vitriol of the OWS. At this point in time, the OWS has not only changed absolutely nothing or put forward any new objections or ideas, they have actually made a mockery of some very legitimate greivances. More often than not OWS protestors are targeting their peers on the street rather than anyone who has committed any actual wrong doing. You call that an intelligent movement? Castigating working people for trying to make a living? That's not only misdirected, it's compelely stupid and counter productive. And you wonder why no one takes anything about the so called movement seriously? By all means, wake up.

Well unlike the ignorant azzhole with the Detroit Lions avatar, you at least make some points - even though you do exactly what the OP says - which is ignore all the points that the 2nd Phase of OWS is forwarding.
So here is the difference between us: I can acknowledge your points. Yes, there are a lot of in OWS we would all rather not have there. But as far as making grievances in the way that you feel it should be done? Well what's that gotten you? Cronyism disappear from politics, did it? Less influence of corporations, SIGs and unions on elections? How about that Citizen's United decision, eh! Oh yeah, THAT helped.
Now I never lived in a tent but I'm glad these people did. They started a wake up call. It has evolved way beyond the tents now.
Oh, and I started another thread that simply let people know that what they were seeing on the MSM about OWS, was no more comprehensive that what was shown about the Tea Party at first. Offered some of the issues. What were the replies from Conservs? Not ONE said "Well let's discuss this issue about...." Just a bunch of parrots repeating what the MSM has fed them. Like 1984...
This thing has just grown thousands of times bigger and gotten a lot more attention. Growing pains of an movement that is still in it's embryonic phases.
We are NOT going away.

OWS has captured the attention and participation of the entire world.
This is indisputible. They have a LOT of very legitimate concerns but
FOX, the RW e-media etc... have enslaved the minds of Conservatives,
much in the way of the book "1984".

Do NOT pay attention to the evidence! WE will tell you what to think.
WE will tell you your opinions.
This has been evidenced in other threads.

So when an Occupier says "We object to the level of influence afforded
Corporations and Special Interest Groups by Citizens United!"
A Conservative will reply as they have been instructed with something
like "You poop on streets!"
Notice how the issue is avoided and the need for Independent thought
is eliminated? Conservatives are simply not equipped to deal with the
ISSUES that OWS has brought up, so they parrot what they have been
taught.
The ISSUES?
* WE DON'T WANT TO END CAPTIALISM, WE want to end the Corporatacracy
and restore our Democratic Republic. For every hour a senator or
congressman spends with a citizen who has a legitimate concern, they
spend over 100 with a lobbyist, CEO or UNION LEADER (Oh Damn, that
eliminates the "Change the Subject Tactic that Conservatives use when
they can't address issues directly!). There is no voice of the people.
Anyone thinking our government is not run by money, is a fool.
* No more bank bailouts. This includes Fannie May and Freddie Mac, btw
(Oh Damn, that eliminates the "Change the Subject Tactic that
Conservatives use when they can't address issues directly!).
* Stop giving money belonging to We the People, away to the corrupt
politicians of foreign governments.
* No more subsidies or tax breaks to any company that doesn't hire
100% American, attribute their income 100% in America and pay their
taxes 100% in America.
* Reverse "Citizen's United" and put elections back in the hands of
The People.
* Repeal Gramm-Leach-Bliley (Like Newt Says!).

Those are just some of the ISSUES. How will Conservatives respond to
the issues? We all know. Dodge, change the subject, Project What they
Have been Instructed to Believe etc...
But they won't address the issues. The ThoughtMasters have told them
not to...

And the MSM has been doing this for years and years. The Right has ONE, count them ONE media outlet and the f'ing 10+ left wing media masters can't stand it.

You do realize this has been going on for years and years on your (cough, cough) news sites. They lost all journalistic integrity by filling everyone with lies and left wing BS and you have the nerve to b*tch about the ONE right leaning cable news network. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>
