My daughter would like to do a background check on someone's arrest record. Does anyone know of a trustworthy, accurate site? She doesn't mind paying a fee if needed.

If the gentleman is local, she can go to her local police station and do a search for maybe $20. I do background checks for prospective tenants at the police station. Housing background et al I use the internet.

@soozoo,

It depends on the police department. The agencies in the area where I live will NOT run a background check for people.

@Sglass,

Thank you for your response. I did check with the local police agency and they don't do searches for the general public. They said to hire a private investigator, which I think would be quite expensive. There are tons of internet sites where you can get info on people, but I don't know if one is better than the other.

@soozoo,

I don't know what a private investigator would charge to do a background check, but it wouldn't hurt to call around and ask.
