OMG! How is it possible that the only conservative in this discussion is speaking about helping the poor and the three liberals and possibly a fourth are saying F* the poor?

I don't know what you're smoking, but I'd like some.

COBRA isn't meant to help the poor...it's meant to help the temporarily unemployed. And it does, even though it is expensive.

If you are concerned about the poor perhaps you should support a public option of single payer instead of what we've got now.

And WHO said fuck the poor? Not one of us. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/doubt.gif"/>

I would consider the temporary unemployed the poor. Sorry, but I see no income, or unemployment insurance to mean the poor.

You probably posted this before you got to see my last most. I don't support the "Public Option" because I think it is wrong for everyone including the poor, but it is more than likely better than what we have now.

You three have basically been saying F* the poor. My point through this entire discussion has been that it doesn't help those that need it the most and you guys keep acting like you don't give a damned... meaning F* the poor.

I had to take COBRA once when I was between jobs...and I didn't consider myself poor. Many unemployed people don't consider themselves poor, especially if they expect to be come employed again soon.

You're right...COBRA doesn't help the poor. It was never meant to help the poor. It's meant to allow people to keep their insurance temporarily before they find another job with insurance benefits.

The poor DON'T HAVE INSURANCE AT ALL. And neither do many of the not actually poor.

Immanuel, I understand now that you were going for hyperbole. OK. But the conservatives have offered nothing constructive since before the election. Health insurance companies have screwed everyone they can, bribed every elected official and appointed regulator they can, and it is going to stop now! Period. Health insurance reform is happening this term.

</quote>

Conservatives have not done shit for eight years or more and you are right, reform is needed... NOW. I am not at all sure that it will come this term or even the next, but it is sorely needed.

Nor am I certain what form it should take!

Given no reform or the Public Option, I'd have to say something is better than nothing, but I am very concerned that the public option is the first step to utter failure of the health insurance industry.

Immie...the first step to the utter failure of the health care industry is to do what the insurance cartels and the Republicans are trying to do...undermine our president's honest attempt to make health care affordable for EVERY American...

Affordability
As health care costs continue to grow faster than wages, health insurance will become more and more unaffordable for more and more American families every day. The financial burdens associated with health care and health insurance will only get worse over time without action.The cost of the average employer-sponsored health insurance plan (ESI) for a family will reach $24,000 in 2016. This represents an 84 percent increase over 2008 premium levels. Under this scenario, we estimate that at least half of American households will need to spend more than 45 percent of their income to buy health insurance.

Sorry guys, It's bad math that will compound the problem. Making Health Care more affordable is the solution, not a Hostile Take Over.
