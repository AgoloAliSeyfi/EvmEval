Oh.The.Horror!

Promoting and defending The Constitution! Honoring the Troops who have served our country and protected our liberty!

No wonder Maggie opposes Beck.

In all seriousness Maggie...

What are you moaning about?
You are disparaging speeches you haven't heard...saying you agree with others thoughts, but not if you don't like them...

That's not saying much about the foundation of your opinions.

And what credentials does Glenn Beck possess to make him an authority on what constitutes honor?

</quote>

Good question, try asking one of the 100,000+ that showed up.

</quote>

The people that watch FOX are simple minded. Some of these simple minded people start thinking that an infotainment talking head is a god. It is a sad reflection on America.

</quote>

Maybe someone should hold a self-serving and self-promoting rally to restore intelligence to America?

It is always interesting to me the vitriol of the ignorant.
People who will jump on the bandwagon of hate because an individual they disagree with is receiving prominence...or in many cases only think they disagree with them because they were told they should.

Glenn Beck is an easy target for ridicule.
The way he chooses to bring a message out is all too often a little too flamboyant, a little carried away. And in the process, unfortunately, his message is lost because of this.

I applaud Glenn Beck, and this rally.
Any rally that brings out the little dark secret that this nation has lost all sense of value and honor is OK by me.
Because we have.

As I've said several times, if it were anybody but Glenn Beck leading the charge, I'd agree wholeheartedly. But he has a clear agenda. End of story.

</quote>

What specific part of the rally do you not agree with? Stop the ad hominem for one damn minute and post something legitimate...please.

</quote>

I too won't apologize for anything I say about Glenn Beck. He gets paid a lot of money to be a troublemaker, and he does it very well. If you don't think he had a strong motive for doing this rally now, on this day, then I'm pretty sure that bridge in Brooklyn is still for sale.

So what you are saying is, if you heard the speeches on the radio you would be applauding...but because the speaker is someone you dislike - you dismiss it.
Got it.

</quote>

If I didn't know the speaker, you would be correct. But I do know him and what his motivation is. It's therefore a moot point.

based on that statement, would you say george washington was a fascist?

</quote>

Glen Beck is no George Wasington.

</quote>

ok. so can you answer the question please?

</quote>

BTW, are you dishonest, or have reading comprehension problems?
"Of course I'm not suggesting Beck or those who organized today's event or past 'tea parties' are fascists..."

Read, think and then post. It might make you interesting.
