I would like to engage a debate on the affirmative action question which is presently before the US Supreme Court. However, rather than fall to uncareful cliches, I would like the discussion to follow from a close reading of the linked NY Review of Books essay by Ronald Dworkin. I'll post just the preamble here for interest, then add the link to the body of the essay.

It's possible that not many will wish to wade into this discussion under my request for a full and careful reading. That would be unfortunate, as complex topics require some amount of work, but the alternative is not very appealing.

Let me finally add that I am quite busy presently, so those of you who wish to dig in, please feel quite free to discuss the issues and arguments without any thought to my contributions.

Comment on Aaffirmative Action
Thank you for posting this question and the Dworkin article. I am no legal expert, but he certainly seems to have touched on at least many of the important points and ideas.

For openers, I found the following passage to be very interesting.

<quote orig_author="Dworkin">

First, I'd like to say that I have always favored affirmative action in principle. That does not mean that I've favored everything that has ever been done or recommended in the name of affirmative action.

In my early days of affirmative action awareness I may have thought of it as compensation for past wrongs. That idea evolved in my mind into the idea that affirmative action was a way of helping groups that had been discriminated against or otherwise disadvantaged by the society to overcome the resulting disadvantages.

What I like in the above quotation is the emerging recognition that affirmative action is necessary in order to ensure a favorable future for the entire community. And that this goal is, first, admitted in the Bush push for the Texas plan; and second, that the goal of a good future via affirmative action is sought after by both major US corporations and the armed forces.

I think this new focus takes us out of the past and away from ideas of compensation, and places us in the present with a healthy view toward the future.

blatham - Just to clarify. You said "I would like to engage a debate on the affirmative action question which is presently before the US Supreme Court." Are you looking for a debate in the legal points (i.e. the legal aspects of how the court should or shouldn't rule..) or the social issue (and any court decision's impact either way..) overall?

I think the points of law are pretty narrow in this case in the end.
