The evacuation zone was precautionary. So far, nothing has happened to require a complete survey before letting people return to their homes after the crisis is over.

Case in point if it is 300 micro Sv per hour at the plant outside perimeter, it can't be that high 1km, 5km, or even 30 km away.

The explosions were from hydrogen gas generated when the reactor cores, and apparently in at least one case, a spent fuel rod pool, were partially uncovered by falling (evaporating, maybe leaking) water levels. The steam was dissociated into its components hydrogen and oxygen.

This is not true.

The hydrogen comes from the zirc-water reaction.

Zr + 2H2O -&gt; ZrO2 + 2H2

If they kept the pumps running, then why did three reactor buildings blow up? Building that had fuel rods on top of the buildings?

Why did they run out of power after 8 hours? That doesn't make any sense at all. And if something doesn't make sense, it probably isn't true.

If you lost your power supply, and you know that if the pumps stop it is disaster, why would they not fly in power for pumps? Before they fail?

This is wrong. There is something wrong here.

If that is true, then the design of the back up system is terrible.
