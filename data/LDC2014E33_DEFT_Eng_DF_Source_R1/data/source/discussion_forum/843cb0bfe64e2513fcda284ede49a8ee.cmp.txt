Joanne,

I am distressed to be the object of your rebukes - truly. I have enjoyed some of your posts on the Poetry section and once, seeing a reference to Iwakuni, suspected you had some connection to the USMC or USN in your past. Besides, anyone who quotes Thomas Merton on her signature line must be taken seriously.

Did your husband fly P-3s or fighters? Fleet Air Wing SIX and Miramar imply very different backgrounds. Perhaps we knew each other. From your window on 32nd street you could see the carriers berthed across the channel at North Island.

I did indeed think I was pretty cool as a "jet jock" as you called it (a term we never used). That lasted about six months until I found myself for the first time out of composure, calm, and ideas in the air. Very humbling indeed - happens to everyone. Now I know we all face equivalent limits. I try not to assume I fully understand those I encounter, but I do react to things I see and I do have opinions. I believe I explained my viewpoint fairly well in subsequent posts (above).

The late '60s and '70s were troubled times. I would hope that all of us learned something from them. Some do, some don't.

What in God's name is there to admire in Jesse Jackson? The story of the fire in the shirt factory in North Carolina sounds very much like a well-known incident that occurred in New York (or was it Boston) in the late 19th century. I don't recall reading about one in North Carolina.

Jesse is human, he has made mistakes and he has done many great things. You judge him from just a few of the ones you want to frame his entire life.

Bill,

Great post! The low person bit pissed me off, but the prose that followed was so good! (wasn't "The irony of wistful recollections....." a great sentence!).

After all these years I'm taking $&amp;it from a %&amp;#$ing grunt!

Perhaps indeed we were but a few miles and worlds apart in that mess. I didn't see much of the BUFs - they came mostly after my last cruise there. However the picture you paint of the bomb walk is frightening enough.

I'm glad and grateful for your forgiveness (and anxious for God's). That was good!

Best wishes,
</post>

Yes he had an affair. So did Henry Hyde, Newt Gingrich, JC Watts, JFK, Bill Clinton and most of his accusers - so have I. I am not throwing stones.
