Neil, There are no easy answers but I still have a lot of faith in capitalism. I also have little faith in conspiracy theories.

Personally I have a couple small solar panels which are used to keep electric fences charged. Not particularly efficient but cost effective compared to running an extension cord a half mile or so.

I am buying four more larger ones for my sailboat to charge a 12 volt system for lights and a (hopefully rarely used) auxilary motor. I have read of houses in Chicago which are using similar systems today.

My guess for the future personal transportation needs will be some sort of direct expansion Stirling cycle alcohol burner. Nissan and the University of Arizona both have both have direct expansion engines in vehicles today.

As far as roofing with solar panels is concerned I see no reason why panels and roofs designed for the job could not be made superior to shingles which IMO are vastly inferior and only modestly less expensive than (my personal favorite) standing seam "galvanized" or "powder coated" metals.
In my personal experience the standing seam has been good for 104 years. Plate glass covered panels should be nearly as good. As Farmerman mentions proper engineering is important. Structurally, electrically, aesthetically, and economically. There is no free lunch.

Right now in rural WV one has to pay between $5,000-$10,000 to get on the grid. This will also help your payback time in some locations. Hopefully some day our elected stewards will realize that subsidies only encourage inefficiencies and that the best interests of all people are not being well served by the systems of subsidies that are currently in place vis-a-vis roads, tariffs, Farm Bills, food stamps, guaranteed loans, and government jobs.

Betting that we will live to see this happen would not be a good use of our retirement funds IMO. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad"/>
Have a good evening, Mech

Hi mech: All good points. I hope you agree that subsidies, grants or prizes preferably private rather than government are necessary to develop new technology and help small business compete with the giant international corporations which are often ruthless, and deserve to be discriminated against in taxation, mandates, grants and subsidies and in the courts.
