You are only looking at one side.

It's not just about whether the army 'turns away' people. It's also about why aren't certain demographics applying in the first place.

What does it matter? Does it really kill you that the army isn't perfectly proportioned to fit UK society? Are you going to disband the Gurkhas, since there obviously aren't that many Nepalese people in the UK? And stop all the Pacific Islanders as well? Then dictate that we can never fight a war in the middle east because it offends Muslims and puts them off signing up?

Again hospitals - it's not just about hospitals accepting patients - it's also about why do certain demographics get ill more than others?

No, it's what are you go to do when you have the answer? Short of some sort of genetically engineering ethnic minorities, what exactly do you propose to solve this non-existant issue?

If there is a reason why an entire group of people are discouraged from an occupation for whatever reason, then we need to investigate it because it represents an inequality in society.

We want a society with racial equality yes?

A non-issue? You think that your skin colour affecting when you die, how likely you are to get cancers, or certain types of injuries - that's not important to you?

What you seem to be suggesting smacks of social engineering and I really don't think that anyone is that bothered about exactly how many non-white people live in Britain.

To be honest, this is a bizarre thread, and at the end of the day, doesn't matter, people are people and it doesn't matter if they are black, white, blue or purple.

And I don't think that people thing of multi-racialism as a 'good thing', and most don't think of it as a 'bad thing' either. It is just is. And there certainly isn't a clamour of being calling for more African's to be imported to make us more 'multiracial', that'd be bizarre.

If we want to encourage immigration then we should encourage it because those people have skills we need or are willing to fill jobs that aren't beng filled and perform services because they aren't being filled. It shouldn't be because they happen to be browner than the average Brit.

Also, 'bragging rights'? Really? The day that wealthy and advanced western nations start telling other that 'We have more black people than you', like some bizarre version of a playground argument, then that may be the day that I go into hiding from society.

I couldn't have expressed it better myself. This is not even a question we should be asking; social engineering itself is a ridiculous endeavour.

There's a lot of talk recently about how diversity is necessary, but how far do we go? And how do we judge what is a good and strong/positive multiracial country?

When you look at other western countries like Canada, America, Australia, the vast majority of its immigrants are not white these days and are probably heading for a more diverse future, so much so to the point that these nations will have very different demographic look to them in 50 years time. They will have great bragging rights you could say when it comes to multiracialism and diversity than Britain or most european countries will maybe not have. You often here quotes like "Hollywood is too white" "the tories are too white" but what defines what is "too white"? So I'm wondering if people could put Britain in the same context?

Like I say people brand multiracialism as a good thing, very few want to go back to a 100% white society but how multiracial do we need to go to satisfy the vast majority of people, particularly liberals? I personally think it's completely necessary but I know many of my opponents will disagree. Are we still not multiracial enough compared to some of our western rivals?? What do you think??
