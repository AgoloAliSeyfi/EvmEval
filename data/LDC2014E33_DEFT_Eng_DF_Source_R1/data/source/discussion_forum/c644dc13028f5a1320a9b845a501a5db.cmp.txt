Define "It."

The authority to tax flows from the constitution, Article 1 section 8. Corresponding law specific to the estate tax can be found in the federal register.

If you're asking where 'it' says that when you die, it's not your money anymore... I'm not sure how to answer that. I'm not sure 'it' says it anywhere; that's just the way it is. A dead man doesn't own anything.

That's right.........because upon his death he bequeathed it to his family. Where in the constitution does it say that when you die, the government is entitled to your wealth? If you had no living relatives and you had no will directing a charity or something to leave your wealth to, I could see the government taking it. But if you direct for your wealth to remain within your family, there is no logical reason for the government to demand a piece of it other than they can take it by force.

An income tax is not mentioned by name in the Constitution, either. Neither is the Air Force or the Department of Homeland Security. Something does not need to be mentioned by name in order to be constitutionally compliant. With regards to the government being entitled to a percentage of certain estates upon death, that can be found in the federal register as I stated.

Dude, the government is entitled to whatever they say they are entitled to. They have guys with guns to enforce it. Doesn't make it right.

Constitutionally Compliant is exactly what the Supreme Court says it is, no more, no less, and only until the Court revises it. That is our system, not original Intent, but Constructive Interpretation and Law. Kind of arbitrary, with no means to challenge the Court.
