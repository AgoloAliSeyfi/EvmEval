I agree that Private education should be banned. I think it should be compulsory for all to attend a state school, and if some want to fork out for private tuition in their own time, that's up to them.
I don't see why the wealth and social standing of your family should guarantee you a better quality education leading to a better career. There are young people growing up in sink estates who, given the right opportunities, are twice as smart as these private school kids coming out with 3A's. What you achieve and how well you achieve it in life should be entirely down to your determination and effort, not what your parents could afford.
It is a very, very bleak statistic. It shows the top 7% are being recycled again and again for the top jobs. The same families buying their way through life again and again.
I'm from a rather typically wealthy town, Harrogate. Very divided in that the proportion in private education here is probably much higher than the national average. For 5 years I attended a school often considered one of the rougher schools locally (nationally it isn't remotely, it was rated outstanding by Ofsted), which is just over the road (literally) from an expensive private school with boarding facilities. I grew up knowing the kids over the road would get a better education because they could afford it, they would get into a better university because of their background, and that they were more likely than me to get the top jobs. The effect of that isnt a pleasant one...I dont like the sound of a society divided so obviously by wealth, and thats what private edication does. I worked my ass off, and to be honest, it paid off for me at GCSE. I can guarantee that given the quality of education I received, I worked harder than those at private schools did to get those grades. Just like how I can guarantee you that a kid in a failing state school worked twice as hard as me to get what he did.
The standard of teaching plays a massive, massive role in what you can achieve, there's no doubt about it. I don't believe in the idea that some people should be able to buy themselves the best. We need to focus on getting all schools in this country up to standard. It's difficult to do when all the best staff are getting sucked up by the private schools and offered to those who can fork out for it.

Surely if parents wish to send their children into state schools it is their right to?

Where do you draw the line? Socialised housing for all children so they don't feel left out? Socialised holidays?

There is a problem if state schools are inadequate, so the focus should be on improving them, not restricting parents' choices.

Private schools are better. This figure has skewed towards them since the end of grammar schools. Comprehensive education = fail.

How?

Surely it depends on how determined the individual is to succeed? Some comprehensive schools can be very good.

Certainly - I don't doubt that, but it helps to be in an atmosphere without less academically able people.

The Stat that interests me is the Oxbridge figures - in the days of Grammar schools 76% of students at Oxford and Cambridge were state educated. Since the onset of Comprehensive education this has dropped nearly 30%. That says something, because I don't think private schools have improved that much since then.

I'm gob-smacked really. Just read a disgusting stat, that states that, 7% of people our privately educated in this country, but they make up 60% of the top jobs in this county ranging from, financial services, The law basically high end jobs.

Now I know the snobs will just tell me that they our well educated and deserve all they get, well sir in my opinion it shows just how much of a unfair divide exists between the upper classes and the ordinary folk.

I have no respect for the silver spooned that rub their privilege in peoples faces. I have all respect for the self made but not snobs. Anyway this stat highlights the considerable troubles that hurt society <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/mad.gif" alt=":mad:"/> <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/mad.gif" alt=":mad:"/>

Its a very simple concept.

-Child of Rich guy, goes to expensive Private College.
-Gets degree
-Joins his dad's firm as a director etc.
OR join's his dad's friend's or relatives firm at a top position.

No rocket science.

You don't need to be privately educated to get a top job, but it does help if you can spell "chosen" and if you can pay attention to detail... like when registering a username on a website.

I just checked and apparently the username 'thechosenone' is unavaliable, probably already taken, so your point is...?

It's a shame really, but that's what you get in a capitalist society. The wealthy will always have an advantage over the rest.
