OWS has captured the attention and participation of the entire world.
This is indisputible. They have a LOT of very legitimate concerns but
FOX, the RW e-media etc... have enslaved the minds of Conservatives,
much in the way of the book "1984".

Do NOT pay attention to the evidence! WE will tell you what to think.
WE will tell you your opinions.
This has been evidenced in other threads.

So when an Occupier says "We object to the level of influence afforded
Corporations and Special Interest Groups by Citizens United!"
A Conservative will reply as they have been instructed with something
like "You poop on streets!"
Notice how the issue is avoided and the need for Independent thought
is eliminated? Conservatives are simply not equipped to deal with the
ISSUES that OWS has brought up, so they parrot what they have been
taught.
The ISSUES?
* WE DON'T WANT TO END CAPTIALISM, WE want to end the Corporatacracy
and restore our Democratic Republic. For every hour a senator or
congressman spends with a citizen who has a legitimate concern, they
spend over 100 with a lobbyist, CEO or UNION LEADER (Oh Damn, that
eliminates the "Change the Subject Tactic that Conservatives use when
they can't address issues directly!). There is no voice of the people.
Anyone thinking our government is not run by money, is a fool.
* No more bank bailouts. This includes Fannie May and Freddie Mac, btw
(Oh Damn, that eliminates the "Change the Subject Tactic that
Conservatives use when they can't address issues directly!).
* Stop giving money belonging to We the People, away to the corrupt
politicians of foreign governments.
* No more subsidies or tax breaks to any company that doesn't hire
100% American, attribute their income 100% in America and pay their
taxes 100% in America.
* Reverse "Citizen's United" and put elections back in the hands of
The People.
* Repeal Gramm-Leach-Bliley (Like Newt Says!).

Those are just some of the ISSUES. How will Conservatives respond to
the issues? We all know. Dodge, change the subject, Project What they
Have been Instructed to Believe etc...
But they won't address the issues. The ThoughtMasters have told them
not to...

And the MSM has been doing this for years and years. The Right has ONE, count them ONE media outlet and the f'ing 10+ left wing media masters can't stand it.

You do realize this has been going on for years and years on your (cough, cough) news sites. They lost all journalistic integrity by filling everyone with lies and left wing BS and you have the nerve to b*tch about the ONE right leaning cable news network. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

ROTFLMBO!!! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

1st Post from Consrv. Zero issues of OP Addressed. Not like that's surprising.

You lack both independence and logic. And you wonder why people don't address the 'issues' you raise. Issues are based on at least some vague reality - left wing whining does not count as reality. Mmmk?

anyone who's stupid enough to believe that the status quo ante citizens was that the electoral power resided in the *people's* hands is stupid enough to believe that OWS has accomplished something beyond 15 minutes of fame.

LOL! ANOTHER One, Cali?

Okay Sweetie, you're absolutely right! There is no such thing as Gramm-Leach-Blilely, Bailouts or the Double Irish.

Now go play and we grown ups will talk about what of course, wouldn't be reality to a child.
