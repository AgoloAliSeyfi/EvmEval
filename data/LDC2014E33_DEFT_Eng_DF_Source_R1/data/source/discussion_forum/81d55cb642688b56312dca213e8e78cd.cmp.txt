Charts and graphs....anyone can create those.
Especially one which owes it's existence to the present presidential administration.
"Obamadiary"?
Please.
Look Chrissie, at the end of the day, the economy is crawling along at about 1.7% annual growth. The US has had it's credit rating lowered TWICE.
Spending is at historic highs with this admin spending more than all others combined.
Unemployment is still at 9% plus. Our Southern border is still a pipeline for illegal immigration and drug trafficking. Gitmo is STILL open. We're having to endure news stories of our troops being killed by roadside bombs in Afghanistan. We still have a president that has NO energy policy other than to kowtow to environmental lobbyists.
The housing market is still being manipulated by a meddling and intrusive federal government. We still have a federal government that goes around suing states for trying to do within the law what the White House will not regarding illegal immigration. We have a federal government acting in deference to unions and union activists, attempting to stop a major aircraft firm from doing business where it sees fit....
You can post all the charts and graphs you wish. It doesn't matter. Until Capitol Hill and Pennsylvania Ave gets out of the way of Main Street, nothing will change.

Do you even pay attention to current events? Or is Fox News your only source of information? Are you just in denial? Does it make it easier for you to dislike him by deluding yourself into thinking he's done nothing at all?

Here is a partial list:

- The stimulus has created millions of jobs in the PRIVATE SECTOR. Even in light of this recent information, repubs still say it was a waste. Not true.

- The unemployment rate dropped from 12% to 8%. (Yes, it's now at 9%, but obviously we are better off than we could have been).

- Obama has made good on most of his campaign promises (as reported by PolitiFact).

- He has killed/captured 5X as many Al-Queda terrorists in his first 3 years than Bush did in all his 8 year presidency. (Don't believe me? Look it up. In fact, I first learned of this fact on Fox News of all sources).

Good Grief Chris, pull your head out of those dark places and read some facts. Your posts are ridiculous. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

Obama has done more than that. And, he was an incredible state senator and US Senator. Republicans can't get passed the black. You get them calling Obama "man-child" at 50 years old (code for boy) and "magic negro" and so on. The list is endless. They constantly try a lame attempt that Bush was made fun of so it's OK if they do it too.

When you point out that Bush, at one time, was the most popular president in history, they make up even more lame excuses that Democrats were "afraid" of not supporting him. OK, then they did support him. Which was it, they did or didn't.

The Republican Party is 90% white, old and based in the Confederate South. They are acting the way conservatives have for over a hundred years. It's who they are.

They just hate Obama. Many of the things they say are so fantastic, they would never say those things about anyone else. Anti Christ? Really?
