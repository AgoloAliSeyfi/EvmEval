Well this has certainly gone in an interesting direction. First off I would like to say that Marijuana is listed as a schedule 1 drug, meaning drugs with a high abuse risk. These drugs have NO safe, accepted medical use in the United States. Does marijuana belong in that schedule? Looking at current medical uses for marijuana I do not think so. Of course lagalization raises many questions. Personally I see marijuana as a safer drug than alcohol but that cannot be said for the other "street" drugs.

Cocaine is a Schedule 2 drug. Not sure what the logic behind that is.

Fine, legalize pot tax it to support rehab programs and use 100% of the war on drug money to go after hard drugs. We could start by buying all of the afghani opium, or better yet pay the farmers to plant wheat instead and take all the money from the Taliban and Al Queda. But simply doing what we are doing because something new might not work is foolish since what we are doing is not working.
