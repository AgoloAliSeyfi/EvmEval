The jobs bill that he is proposing 100 billion for tax credits for small business's to hire has been tried before during the Jimmy Carter years. It did not work then it won't work now. Small business was firing people one day and hiring the same people back the next day to get the tax credit. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

If people have no money to spend they don't spend Our economy is consumer driven, when people, rich, middle class and poor don't spend they create NO DEMAND, when there is NO DEMAND for products or services that Business produces business will not hire new employess, there is no need to. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

Across the board tax cuts have always worked, they are proven, yet this President and his administration believe that it is government spending that works,. it never has and they will have to find out the hard way with no new job creation in the private sector and an electorate that is eager to vote them out of office and into an unemployment line in November 2010.

Actually, Jimmy Carter's tax credit was one of the few things that he did right. Believe me, I'm no Carter fan, but the tax credit for hiring people was actually responsible for 700,000 new jobs.

Of course, it's only a temporary fix, to kick-start hiring. In Carter's day the kick-start didn't work in the long run, because none of the other economic factors of a recovery were in place, unlike today, where all the factors are in place except unemployment.

As far as the "Across the board tax cut" statement goes:

If it works like it did for Reagan, we will have another year-and-a-half of rising unemployment, and growing deficits due to lower revenue, before we start getting a jobs recovery.

And that doesn't sound good to me at all.

As long as Government Payroll and Benefit Packages rise, the private sector burden will rise, so will the deficit, and unemployment. Staying the course is unsustainable.

That is somewhat true, which is why encouraging private sector job growth is a good idea.

Across-the-board tax cuts is one way to go, but does not focus on the issue at hand, and thus may take longer.

But the other problem with across-the-board tax cuts is that, according to the Laffer Curve, lowering taxes any further will result in a dramatic decrease in revenue, causing a much larger deficit than we already have now.

This is because we passed the optimum level of raising the GDP to produce more revenue through tax cuts some time ago.

You did catch the posts that pointed out that the "'09" Budget was the Budget made in 2008, right?

And of course the reason for that was that tax revenues decreased dramatically, as the economy collapsed from '07 to '08, raising the deficit dramatically.
