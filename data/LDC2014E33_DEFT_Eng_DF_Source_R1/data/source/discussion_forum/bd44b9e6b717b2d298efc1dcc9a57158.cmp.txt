The problem appears to be London.

The cap appears to have been set at the average income in the UK.

The problem is that average incomes, and subsequently average housing costs, are greater in some areas of the South East than others.

£26k would possibly keep you quite comfortable in some areas, but looking at property prices in parts of London I can see why someone might need more.

This is where I have the problem while there's places in London that where the 26k might struggle there's lot of areas where 26k would be fine so maybe a borough by borough basis but not the whole of London.

Another area of concern is for those losing a job. If you've worked hard for many years and your factory closes down, is it absolutely necessary for the state to make your family up and move sticks immediately, from benefit payment number 1?

Surely they could remove this cap for those being made redundant for the first 6 or 12 months.

I'm still a firm believer those that can afford it should use income protection insurance to cover this period, while those from poorer backgrounds shouldn't be penalised in this period.

Finally, one of the presenters on Radio 4's Today Programme was interviewing a minister earlier this week. I think they'd figured out this cap will only save us something like £100-odd million a year. That's hardly likely to make a huge hole in the budget defecit.

The way some tabloids have prattled on you'd think it was the lack of this cap which was bleeding the country dry. The truth is, it's hardly part of the equation.

I'm not against a cap per se, I just think it should be done in the way that's fairest to everyone, and not just as a headline grabber.

Certainly punish the scroungers. Just don't withdraw much needed benefits from hard working individuals who are down on their luck for a short while, through no fault of their own.

Maybe the actual figures should be published for all to see. As for tabloids maybe they're just starting to publish what people who do work are thinking a minority have been taking them for a ride. While it may not be pc press I'm sure most sensible people can tell the difference between the scroungers and people making the effort to get back into work.

I could see contribution based allowance doing something like this, doubt many would see this as being bad.

It was £300 million now believed to be £500 million.
