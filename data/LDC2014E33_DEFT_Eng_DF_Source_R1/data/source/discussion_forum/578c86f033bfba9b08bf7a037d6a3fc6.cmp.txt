What you find contemptible about her is that she accused a conservative.

No, what I find contemptable is that she used this guy to advance herself, and then stabbed him in the back when that was advantageous. It lacks honor and decency. That goes beyond partisanship.

Ask some of the RW people about me. Half of them think I'm a liberal because I don't toe the idealogical line. I'm just as critical of Republicans and Democrats- when they deserve it.

No, and neither do you. The comparison is stupid, and again, you're crediting her with psychic abilities, along with the ability to make herself get subpoenaed.

Well, if she said, "Clarance, Great Guy" like everyone else who was asked about Judge Thomas by the FBI, she wouldn't have gotten supeoned. Instead she said, "Ummm, he said something bad once, what a bad guy... you aren't going to put my name to this, are you? I might need another letter of recommendation."

Iran Contra HELPED the nation. Got our hostages out, helped defeat the Commie Sandinistas... Are you kidding?

The problem is that Republicans keep crapping on the nation, so we have to have special prosecutors to slow them down. Then they get angry over being investigated so they investigate a land deal and a blow job for revenge.

Actually, going back to your psychic powers bullshit, how did those mean old Republcans actually make Clinton lie?

Here's how Clinton could have avoided problems.

"Did you get a blow job from Monica".
"Yeah."

Problem solved. Now, Hillary might have brained him with an ashtray, but he wouldn't have been in legal trouble. Or better yet, he could have settled with Jones when she was only asking for a third of what she eventually got and an apology.

Please be logical. The CIA says that she was covert. You are acting as if because no one could be convicted, she becomes non-covert.

Valerie Plame was a covert agent at the time she was outed. The CIA has verified this.

I always find it hysterically funny when a leftist suddenly develops a love for the CIA. No, really. After years of thinking the CIA is putting microchips in their butts, they suddenly loooooove the CIA when it has a problem with Bush.

Let's be blunt. This was intergency office politics... and it was bullshit. The CIA told Bush, "It's a slam dunk, Mr. President" on WMD's. Then there weren't any WMD's and the fingerpointing started. Please.

She becomes "non-covert" because no one was actually charged with that. Because her name was publically out there where even Nancy Drew could have figured out who she was. It isn't covert when half the reporters and politicians in Washington knows you work at the CIA and you sent your house husband off on a junket because he looked bored around the house.

Here's the gag about Joe Wilson. In Febuary of 2003, he wrote an op-ed where he not only said he believed Saddam had WMD's, but we shouldn't invade because he might use them. So much for him knowing the "truth".

<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/06/opinion/oe-wilson6">A 'Big Cat' With Nothing to Lose - Los Angeles Times</a>

But after it all goes south and it looks like they might start firing people at the CIA, he goes public that he "knew" there were no WMD's, and people asked, "Who the heck is Joe Wilson?"

Yeah. From what I've read Plame was the best "unkept" secret in DC. She was no more covert than I am. Her last assignment in Russia was a bust. They had to send her home because the Russkies knew who she was. She was assigned desk duty thereafter. Can't be covert when the enemy has you pegged.

As for WMD's Hell. Every intelligence agency in the world thought Saddam had em and thats what the invasion was based on. Incorrect intel from everyone.

Well, the reason why the intel agencies thought that was because that's what Saddam wanted them to think.

Because he thought the reason why he didn't get ousted in 1991 was becasue the alliance didn't want to fight a chemical war in Iraq. So as long as they thought he had them, he was safe, even as he gave most of them up and was unable to produce new ones.
