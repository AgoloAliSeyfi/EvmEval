I hear a lot these days about asking people and companies to pay their fair share in taxes. While Im not sure what a fair share is (it seems that everyone believes they are paying a fair share or more of their own income already), I wonder if that should be the deciding factor. Should tax policy be fair, or should it focus more on what is best for the country?

We have a determinable tax base from which to draw these revenues, so lets assume that expected revenue, without difficult to support GDP changes based upon certain plans, remains the same. How would you divide the taxpaying pie between the various income levels? We could conclude that it was the most beneficial to reduce the levels paid by the lower income levels, in order to spur consumption. Lower income households would tend to immediately spend those additional dollars on things they either want or need. Of course, since many of the products that are purchased by this group are made in China, it may not spur our economy to the extent you would think, and it would most certainly reduce the countrys saving rate and dollars available for investment, but there is a case to be made that it would increase economic activity, at least in the short term. If instead you reduce the levels paid by the upper income levels, those additional dollars will likely not be immediately spent, but invested in (hopefully) some productive endeavor. Again, some (probably fairly sizeable) percentage of those funds would also find their way to China as investments in plant or equipment, or in purchases of business assets. However, the savings rate of the country and the total pool of private capital would increase, theoretically spurring business investment. Setting aside what is fair, which do you think provides the best chance for long-term growth and prosperity? Is there an optimum level where consumers have enough to spend and the pool of capital is adequate?

Government has no business being anything other than Impartial. Either it establishes and serves Justice or it is at war with Justice. Can't have it both ways.

LOL. Yeah you're tearing my argument to pieces. A fellow conservative even tried to explain this to you and asked why you can't grasp this.

Not every conservative has a firm grasp on every issue. Conservatives in this forum post all kinds of stuff that is just plain wrong. That's because they were all educated by communist indoctrinators. They mistakenly believe some of the swill they were spoon-fed in government schools.

I ask about your schooling and job because I need to know if I'm actually dealing with someone who has the capability enough to use his brain to hold a job or achieve some sort of degree. I have serious doubts at this point.

No, you're simply a leftwing jackass who is losing the argument. You haven't really thought about the stuff you believe in, so it's easy for someone who has to tear you apart.

You aren't fooling anyone by attacking my schooling or my mental capabilities. Anyone with a brain can see who is losing this exchange.

I didn't attack your education or job. I just inquired about it. Learn the difference...oh thats right, you can't.

I'm going to cut my losses and learn that talking to you is like explaining things to someone with severe autism and a severe delusions.

I'm sorry you're embarrassed by your lack of education and job. It does explain a lot about you though.
