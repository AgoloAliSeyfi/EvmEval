God, why couldn't that jap gunner in WWII have aimed a little better and prevented this from ever happening?

Not funny. Not appropriate. GHW Bush is a great American hero, with his actions and bravery in WWII. And he was a pretty damn good president, too, especially compared to the guy right before him. Reagan's horrible policies started to come home to roost under Bush's term. He's a victim of prior incompetence in the same way Obama is, only to a much, much, much, much lesser degree.

Oh no, not Neg rep, what will I ever do? While your hero George was busy being a lousy pilot and getting rescued by a submarine, Prescott was busy channelling money to Hitler. Just imagine, only a few more inches and no S&amp;L scandal, no rigged election, no Iraq war, the possibilities are endless. You make this sound like a bad thing.

Jeb Bush signed the Statement of Principles in June, 1967 along with other RW neo-conservatives who lead us into the Iraq war, economic chaos and the death and injury of thousands of Americans.
Anyone who supports Jeb Bush or any neo-conservative is a fool!

From your link:

<quote>
Our aim is to remind Americans of these lessons and to draw their consequences for today. Here are four consequences:  we need to increase defense spending significantly if we are to carry out our global
responsibilities today and modernize our armed forces for the future;

 we need to strengthen our ties to democratic allies and to challenge regimes hostile to our interests and values;

 we need to promote the cause of political and economic freedom abroad;

 we need to accept responsibility for America's unique role in preserving and extending an international order friendly to our security, our prosperity, and our principles.

I see absolutely nothing wrong with those goals.

I take it that you would suggest quite the opposite?

That's coming along just fucking splendidly so far...

Those goals=

Jeb would make a great Senator. He has experience and clout within his party. He would offer a sane voice and moderation within the party

Too bad he can't run for President

Jeb would have to cheat to win a national election.

The republicans cant cheat that much anymore because the electronic machines are being watched more closely now.
