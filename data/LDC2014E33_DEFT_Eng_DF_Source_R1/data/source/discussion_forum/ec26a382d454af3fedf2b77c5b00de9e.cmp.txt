Monday September 25, 2006

Gordon Brown today laid out his credentials to be the next Labour leader and prime minister, telling the Labour party conference: "I know where I come from, what I believe and what I can contribute."

Mr Brown made a public admission of his "regret" over the "differences" between himself and Tony Blair, saying "where over these years, differences have distracted from what matters I regret that, as I know Tony does too". [..]

He told the conference he offered: "New Labour renewed, not just holding the centre ground, but modernising it in a progressive way too."

His 37-minute speech was received with an ovation lasting two minutes and 45 seconds.

The PM, who sat on stage alongside the chancellor, has so far pointedly refused to endorse any candidate as his successor. [..]

Mr Brown immediately stressed he would, if leader, want to "draw on all the talents of our party and country" - hinting he may offer cabinet jobs to personal rivals.

He also talked about his upbringing in a Scottish rectory "surrounded by books, sports, music and encouragement", opportunities denied to some of his friends. [..]

His speech ranged across the Middle East, global poverty, terror, education, the environment, citizenship, parliament, as well as his own childhood and his praise for Mr Blair.

As billed in advance, he suggested forming an independent executive to run areas like the NHS, in the manner in which he made the Bank of England independent. [..]

He suggested that decisions over peace and war should be matters for parliament, as well as making patronage over appointments arm's-length from government in the wake of the cash-for-honours saga.

And, while the police investigation into claims that Labour lenders were offered honours continues, Mr Brown said he thought home helps and carers "should be the first call for our honours system". [..]

On policy, he announced that the Treasury would be publishing a far-reaching study of the interaction of economics and climate change in the next few days.

After the tumultuous infighting of early September, a tentative truce between the Blair and Brown camps is so far holding in Manchester.

Is he gone yet?

Have they counted the spoons at No. 10?

Interesting, melancholic piece of historical background:

A year after Walter Wolfgang was thrown out for heckling at Labour's annual conference, many complain that security has become too heavy handed. But it has always been like this, says Natasha Walter, whose father was jailed for protesting at Harold Wilson's 1966 conference

&lt;snip&gt;

My mother, Ruth, shared that sense of pride [..]. "Those were good times," she says now. "We felt as though it was worth raising our voices for what we believed, so we did. There were a lot of other people who thought like us, that it was worth having a go and trying to change things. There was an optimism about the way things were going. I never thought we'd end up with what we have now, 40 years on. We seem to have regressed in so many ways."

The Labour party conference opened yesterday, a crazed blend of the new and the traditional. The convention centre, in Manchester, looked as if it ought to be welcoming a meeting of computer systems operators, or travel agents, or, these days, even porn stars. [..]

But inside little had changed. It could have felt familiar to anyone who attended the last Labour conference in Manchester, in 1917. The report of the conference arrangements committee, a body that makes the Soviet politburo seem as open as the Big Brother house, referred to compositing and procedures on the contemporary motions criteria.

Only a few delegates could understand this stuff, but they knew they were being stitched up. "Conference is being gagged!" said a young man from the platform as he tried and failed to make a speech about Trident. A woman added, to loud cheers: "If democracy is good enough for the Middle East, it's good enough for the Labour party." Heavens, where has she been living? [..]

Then came the merit awards to people who have spent a lifetime in the party's service. A few years ago they were allowed to say a few words about their six decades in the movement, but they began to say disobliging things about the leader, so now they just pick up a plaque from him and push off.

Then we were back with Hazel, who looked shiny in scarlet. Everything about her was shiny: her cheeks, her forehead, clothes, her eyes, and most of all her teeth, which shone and smiled at us and at Mr Blair, who shone back in her direction. "He has been a great inspiration to us," she beamed.

She showed us a video. Apparently members of the cabinet had briefly worked alongside real workers. She had worked in a branch of Tesco, where she asked a young man if he had to sell what head office told him to stock, or if local customers could choose what they wanted. The young man looked evasive.

Well, if someone specifically asked for something, staff could write it on a bit of paper at the manager's office. Hazel thought this was fabulous. "Here the customer comes first, and that's really, really refreshing," she said.

And that summed up New Labour. It's government by Tesco: you have to have what head office tells you to have, but if you want something else, you write it on a bit of paper. And much good may it do you.
