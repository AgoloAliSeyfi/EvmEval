Ah, but then Bush is Bush!

One Iraq in the hand of Bush is better than two not in Bush's hand! <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/wink.gif"/> <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/smiles.gif"/>

so, why beat around the bush?

The most unfortunate part is that there is low credibility ever since no WMD could be found inspite of all the search!

And it was so vociferously, emphatically trumpeted that Iraq was flush with WsMD.

No amount of justification that there was good reasons to believe can only be summed up with the Rubbaiyya of Omar Khayyam

The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,
Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.

A moment guess'd--then back behind the Fold
Immerst of Darkness round the Drama roll'd
Which, for the Pastime of Eternity,
He doth Himself contrive, enact, behold.

And the credibility sunk even lower for not just the US Ray, but for the coalition as a whole by the bad way the David Kelly inquiry was handled by the British government.

I'll try to explain my perspective on all this. It might ramble at times.

I was for the war, still am if it could be fought properly, but it can't be. Bush's goal is a secure Iraq, with a functioning gov't that can police the country and be an American ally in the War On Terror. THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN.

My knowledge is all second hand, but that's all I have to go on. I'm seeing a picture of a nation of subhuman savages. Did anyone ever bother to ask WHY Saddam did the things he was hung for? We're seeing the answer to that question. These people need a dictator who's willing to use mass murder when they step out of line. Unfortunately we aren't prepared to use similar tactics, so this war is unwinnable.

If it was up to me, everytime an IED goes off we'd get our people out, draw a circle on a map with at least a 500m radius around the point of the blast, and turn that area into a smoking crater. And I don't care if there's a school full of kids there with classes in session. Do that a few times and these "people" might start to behave better. We can surge troops all we want, but if the level of cruelty doesn't increase it will all be pointless. That's the only thing they understand.

I can't believe I was stupid enough to buy all the tripe about what Iraq could become if we just remove the dictator.

I also have some problems with Bush that I didn't have when I voted for him, based on his piss poor performance. He's recently changed policy to go after the Iranian agents that are supplying the militias. We've seen stories that the CIA has been tracking these Iranians for over two years. Why change now? WHY DIDN'T WE WHACK THEM AS SOON AS THEY WERE IDENTIFIED??? How many Americans are dead or maimed because Bush was playing some diplomatic footsy game with Iran?

There are two of our Border Agents in prison for doing their jobs, and twelve Marines sitting in jail in San Diego for hitting the wrong house after they were attacked in Haditha. Bush hasn't lifted a finger to help either of those groups of men, and that's why IMO Bush has shown himself to be nothing but an honorless pig.

Can someone talk me out of this? Because it's looking pretty damn bleak to me.
