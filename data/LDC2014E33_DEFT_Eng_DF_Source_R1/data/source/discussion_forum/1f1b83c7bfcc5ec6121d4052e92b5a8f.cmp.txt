This political uncertainty in Thailand still drags on and on and on. This is bad also for the image of the 10 nation ASEAN Association.

8 Apr Assoc Press Unrest in Thailand and controversy over Myanmar's elections are likely to overshadow a summit of 10 Southeast Asian leaders who had intended to focus on economic matters.

The summit was set to open in Hanoi on Thursday, one day after Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva declared a state of emergency in the face of escalating anti-government protests. At the last minute, he canceled his participation in the 16th annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

"The situation in Bangkok is worrying, and it's a somber backdrop to our discussions," Singaporean Foreign Minister George Yeo said. "I really hope that the situation there will not lead to violence."

Leaders from the 10 ASEAN nations were expected to focus on economic integration and climate change.....

Quick update. The government closed an opposition aligned tv station, and in retaliation the protesters stormed a tv station used by the government. The government backed down and allowed the TV station they had closed earlier to start operating again.

This is just going to get worse. The people with the power don't plan to share it &amp; the people who have been illegally forced out appear to be unprepared to accept it. And all of this with a Royal succession looming. Thailand is going to pay a terrible price for the unwillingness of certain segments of society to share power. Four years in and this has not even begun to get bad.

Thousands flee Bangkok
BEN DOHERTY, BANGKOK

Up to 15 people have been killed and thousands of tourists forced to flee, after Thai soldiers opened fire on red-shirt protesters in Bangkok in pitched battles all over the city.

After a month-long standoff between the anti-government red-shirts and Thai security forces, troops yesterday moved in to remove the red-shirts from the key intersections theyd occupied in the Thai capital.

But, meeting a resolute red-shirt army, the previously good-natured demonstrations suddenly turned violent.

Reports say up to 15 people were killed - a hospital spokesman last night confirmed 10 deaths - and more than 600 injured, after soldiers, who initially fired rubber bullets at protesters, began firing live rounds.

Four soldiers are believed to have been killed in the rioting and violence which followed. No Australians are among the dead or injured.

Some of the fiercest fighting occurred at the eastern end of famed tourist strip, Khao San Road, when riot police, backed by soldiers, attempted to push back red-shirt protesters from their base.

Nicholas Gilmore, 26, from Perth, said the red-shirt protesters refused and then, faced with advancing lines of police and soldiers, began throwing rocks and pieces of brick.

I was just standing there, taking pictures, then the guy near me threw something at the troops... I think it was a bamboo stick... and they just started shooting at him.

The first bullet just missed me, it was so loud, I could feel it come right past me, it must have missed me by a foot.

Mr Gilmore told The Age that the troops fired rubber bullets initially.

But then, as I was standing round the corner, someone said they were firing live rounds, so I wasnt too keen to come around again. They were just firing and firing, indiscriminately.

There were explosions going off too, I dont know what they were, but they were incredibly loud.

Peter Foster, 23, and Ryan Bekavak, 25, from Brisbane were caught on the rooftop of the hotel for more than three hours as the gun battle raged below them.

Helicopters which had been circling overhead all afternoon dropped teargas to try to disperse the protesters.

But then the gunshots started, and it was just continuous,they just kept firing. We couldnt move from where we were in the hotel, but we could just kept hearing more and more shots fired, Mr Foster said.

Late last night, the red-shirts were in control of much of Bangkok. While cordons of troops were still on the streets, most of the key intersections in the capital were controlled by red-shirts.

The protesters set up makeshift barriers using logs, metal barricades and barbed wire to stop police and army vehicles moving through.

Through the middle of the night, thousands of red-shirts remained on the streets, promising their protest would continue throughout Songkran, the Thai New Year celebrations this week
