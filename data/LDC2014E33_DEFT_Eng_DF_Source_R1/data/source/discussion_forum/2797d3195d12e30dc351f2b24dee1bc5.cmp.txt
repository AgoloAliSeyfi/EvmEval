This is absolutely sickening. What in God's name is going on with the Federal Government? The Obama administration?

The world's largest oil skimmer has sat immobile for weeks on end as the BP Oil leak gushed. Obama golfed. Obama wined and dined. Obama fundraised. Obama wagged his finger at BP.

For the last 66 days the entire American skimming effort has resulted in 600,000 gallons of oil skimmed. The projected capabilities of the "A-Whale" skimmer is 500,000 gallons PER DAY.

Are Americans simply suffering from an incredibly inept and self-involved White House, or is it something even more dubious...?

______

The A-Whale bills itself as the largest open-water oil skimmer in the world, and it’s at least very impressive. Originally an oil and ore tanker, the ship’s owners recently refitted the ship to do exactly the kind of work that the US so desperately needs in the Gulf of Mexico, and to do it on a vastly larger scale than current operations can handle. According to the ship’s project manager, the entire American effort in 66 days has skimmed off 600,000 barrels of oil. The ship’s owners claim that A-Whale can skim 500,000 barrels a day

So where is the A-Whale now? In the Gulf? Not yet. It’s on its way there after being tied to a dock in Norfolk, Virginia, and won’t be allowed to join the cleanup effort until the Coast Guard and the EPA figure out whether it meets their standards

...Overton blasted BP and the federal government for a lack of effort and coordination in their dual oil-spill response and made a plea to the government to allow the A Whale to join the cleanup operation.

... This, by the way, is Day 68 of the Gulf crisis. The A-Whale didn’t get refitted on Day 66; this work had to have been done over months, if not years. Shouldn’t the government have known about the existence of this ship two months ago, and been working on certifying it immediately? The A-Whale shouldn’t have had to stop at Norfolk at all to get the nation’s attention, but should have been hired to steam directly to the Gulf and get to work immediately. It’s indicative of a crisis management team that is spending more time worrying about regulations and red tape than cleaning up the mess, just as we saw with Packgen’s boom.

And this is regarding the Packgen's Boom statement that concluded the article - further and undeniable proof of a federal government and Obama White House that is proving completely inept at this time of crisis...
___

After the federal bureaucracy finally got notified by Jake Tapper of an untapped inventory of boom that could be put to good use in the Gulf disaster, the Joint Command insisted that Packgen’s boom didn’t meet its quality standards. Packgen responded by having an outside analyst inspect its product. As Jake Tapper reports in his follow-up, it not only meets the standards but is actually superior to its competition:

Ohh from the title I thought this was about how many gallons of gas are wasted daily in drive thru lanes. In Florida alone.

No - it's about how many more gallons of oil the Obama administration and federal government are allowing to wash up on American shores...

"We need this ship. We need this help," Overton said. "That oil is already contaminating our shoreline. We've got to get the ship out there and see if it works. There's only one way to find out: Get the damn thing in the gulf and we'll see."

...TMT also is firm is working with the Coast Guard to gain approval to operate in the gulf, which may require a waiver from a 90-year-old maritime act that restricts foreign-flagged vessels from operating in U.S. waters, said Bob Grantham, a TMT project officer.

And it gets worse - hundreds of skimmers sit idle...
___

Ken Marrero alerted me to this video of Florida Senator George LeMieux alerting the world that there are hundreds of oil skimmers across the country and the federal government has refused to allow them to be transferred to the Gulf to help in the cleanup because  get this  there may be an oil spill somewhere else and they might be needed there.

As LeMieux says, that this logic is like not sending a firetruck to a house fire because some other house might catch fire and the truck might be needed for that possible fire.

And yet more evidence: 1500 oil skimmers not being utilized in the clean-up and shoreline protection effort:

Jones Act: Maritime politics strain Gulf oil spill cleanup

Pressure is building for President Obama to lift a 1920 protectionist law so that high-tech foreign oil skimmers can help with the Gulf oil spill. Why are 1,500 available US oil skimmers not on the scene?

Where are they going to put all those boats when a storm comes along?

Doesn't matter, that will just be Obama's fault as well.
