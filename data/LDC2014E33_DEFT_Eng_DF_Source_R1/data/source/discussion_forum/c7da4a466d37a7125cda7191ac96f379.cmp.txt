a) fair enough. i go to a state school in London and I have found, however, that this stops being the case at A-level since no one in an Economics A-level class, for instance, is not going to want to not learn.

So, yeah, possibly more prevalent in the less traditional A-levels/the lower school. Not so prevalent in Sixth Form where every one has grown the **** out of acting like an idiot.

b) One of the most important and prevalent difference between GCSEs and A-levels is that you are given freedom. Regardless of whether you are a private school/state school kid, the very nature of A-level qualifications means that you are bound to be compelled to be independent. Perhaps, yes, state school pupils exercise this freedom in different ways than their private school counterparts but this doesnt mean that the school gives you "too much freedom", per se.

c) Absolute rubbish. Do you seriously not think State Schools also participate in national league tables? You are an economist, from what I gather in your sig. State schools, in a sense, are businesses (perhaps not as profit driven as private schools, but they do possess incentives nonetheless) Academically poor Schools are naturally stigmatised and thus the local community will be less likely to send their children to those schools. Schools naturally want the best students so they can progress as social institutions. It's absolutely ridiculous to claim "sixth-form teachers only have the incentive to make sure all students get Es"

d) Fair enough. In my experience, though, extra curricular clubs etc are widely publicised in school, its just nobody really goes. Perhaps they are also very sport-orientated as opposed to academic.

e) LOL. Seriously? "You might not be able to talk at the end" What evidence do you have for this? If you are generalising from data given about a small, small minority of state schools whose children fail to read/write at the age of 16 its not even worth arguing with you. Articulating yourself in a proper way is only marginally determined by which school you attend.

Though I agree with the fact that private school kids are more likely to be better at articulating themselves purely because of better resources etc etc, going to a state school does not mean that you "might not be able to talk at the end"

If your English has gotten worse then thats prolly suttin to do with who you choose to hang around with as opposed to actually being a student in the mainstream sector of education.

your opinions are all justified. They're just not true from what I have seen <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

for the last point. I mean I drop my 't's and say 'like' far too much now, people don't really speak like that at private schools especially when there are international students who speak flawless English and you end up speaking like those around you so....

So you're telling me every state school sixth form in the country is only driven by making sure their students merely pass with an E grade?

Which one of your classes get regularly disrupted? I have different friends in different sixth forms across London (some of them rated "satisfactory") and none of their classes ever get disrupted. Again, this may be due to the fact you're less likely to get disruptive students in A2 classes etc

The only argument of yours that actually makes a little sense is the extra-cirruc point.

So what? I say "like", speak in slang depending on whatever situation I'm in. Does this mean that my state-school has failed me as a student? I'm hardly going to speak patois-like slang when I'm in certain social situations/speaking to the Headmaster, for instance.
