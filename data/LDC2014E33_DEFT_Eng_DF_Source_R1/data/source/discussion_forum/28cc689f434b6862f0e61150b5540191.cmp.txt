By far the best debater and most informed candidate and could easily kick Obama's ass in a debate...

Turned Clinton from a deficit spending President in a fortunate economy to a budget surplus and Democrat pro-sexual harassment hero..

Soo.. what's your beef with this Guy...?

I have no beef with him. At least he told the truth and said that the budget was BALANCED during Bill Clinton's presidency.

Clinton never balanced the budget.

The only thing he balanced was interns.

Yup.. Clinton went along with it kicking and screaming but then experienced that typical Democratic long term/short term memory loss and took full credit.. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Indeed...and in his re-election Bid? Clinton was forced to do the Potamic Two-step Electric Slide to the center like a good politician. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

My main beef is his hypocrisy going after Clinton for an affair. I don't trust him to put the nation before politics.

Don't have one. He's already my choice, assuming he's still in by the time my state's primary rolls around.

In the primary my vote will go to Newt. That is who I think that can kick Obama's ass in a debate and an election

More importantly (if not more urgently), I think his plans for getting our country out of the mess it's in are really good.
