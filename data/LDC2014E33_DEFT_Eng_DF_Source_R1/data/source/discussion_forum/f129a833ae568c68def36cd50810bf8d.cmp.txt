I reckon the minute you stop the habits you are aware of and not keen on, he'll be on the phone, texting or whatever, asking you how you are or what you are up to etc... Nothing like a bit of mystery and elusiveness to keep someone interested, he'll be wondering why you aren't phoning or texting and what you're doing instead...

Btw you *can* control it, you have ownership of your feelings and actions. I think it's fine to have an accepted level of contact as someone mentioned, so why not try keeping it light, instead of "why didn't you contact me?", why not, "been busy at work (etc)? Hope you're not too tired, give me a ring when you're free x" sort of thing - despite the urge to question him on why he hasn't called.

The actual feelings, I think you realise that only you can deal with those and it's unfair to burden him with the responsibility of filling that gap in your life. However I don't think there's anything wrong with explaining to him, "I'm sorry for the phone call/text (if you felt you came over too strong), I realise it was a bit much, it's because I feel a bit insecure at times, but I'm working on it." Any decent OH will understand and try and meet you halfway <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/smile.gif"/> I think the fact you are aware of it is a good thing - you do sound like you need to think about yourself more positively.

I was a bit like this. I used to be upset if my OH didnt return my calls or texts and I'd get a horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach. It wasnt that I didnt trust him, I just felt that I would always call him back if I missed his calls and just wanted the same courtesy from him. I think, as a man, he didnt realise how important it was to me. He would always say, if he'd seen I had called he would have called me back (he always had his phone on silent because of work) but that didnt make it any better. I dont think it was me being needy per se, I think it was more needing to be needed. i.e I wanted him to want to call me back as soon as he saw my missed call. I think that when I got upset with him for not calling back, I was really more upset with myself because of the state i'd got myself in because of it and the fact that when I said it out loud to him, it seemed really petty but yet in the hours i'd been waiting for him to call it had taken on this huge significance!!

I suppose I used to think He doesnt return my call = He doesnt love me. It seems a bit silly now but I was fairly young when we met and this seemed to so important to me. I knew it wasnt rational but that didnt make it any easier!

You need to work out why you are placing such a huge significance on him not returning calls/texts.

We have now been married 7 years and together almost 9 years. As time went by, it became a regular thing to call each other at about 1pm everyday. We have been doing this now for almost 8 years!!!! A day doesn't go by when, if we are not together, we dont call each other. We both need each other equally now and in fact its him now that gets upset if I dont call him back. But I kinda like that he needs me, so I suppose I got what I wished for!!!!
