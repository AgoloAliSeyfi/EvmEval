@jespah,

Thanks, j. Excellent song. I'll have to come back and listen a few more times.

What continues to strike me about being on my own is what opens up. Going through my budget the other day (there is a lot less money in the budget now, obviously.) I was fretting over whether I needed to quit my gym membership. It's about a hundred a month and there is a locker rental of $150 every six months. Not a lot, but there are other things I could use the money for. (Attorney fees, for example.)
Once I stopped whining, I started asking myself why I have the gym membership. I have it because I run in the morning and I need a place to shower and change before work. (I have a whole routine of TH-take home laundry--SA-Take fresh clothes to gym.) Okay. So what would have to change in order for you not to need the gym?
Um.
Run after work. Shower at home.
Duh.
I can carry (or wear) my running stuff and my lunch (another money saver) to work and then run around the park or up the river to the apartment. (slaps forehead)
Of course, the reason I was running in the mornings was so I could be at home with L. at night.
So, I went yesterday to cancel my membership and my timing is perfect. I have another thirty days on my membership and luckily the locker runs out about the same time, so I can still run in the mornings for the next month and then switch to nights.
(But, said the inner whiner, what about the weight training {that I haven't been doing regularly for awhile} ??)
um

@Joe Nation,

Very smart, Joe...$125/mo. for a shower is a bit high.

Do you think you could take a look at MY budget? I'm not having much success with it. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink"/>

@Joe Nation,

Thinking on your feet, Joe. (Occasionally I miss smileys)

You'll arrive home all warm and circulating and able to sleep like a log, at the appropriate time.

I hope you had fun being probed by aliens.

@spikepipsqueak,

Pips, we have smilies if we want them. When you reply, click on the green letters above the box Enable BBCode Editor. You only have to do that once unless you change you mind and don't want the BBCode choices anymore.

@Joe Nation,

Have a great Saturday, JoeNation.

$1500 for a shower? you could have some serious fun with that. Serious fun. Hunh. What an odd phrase.

I'm off to the hardware store to pick up a length of stick, to use as my practice cane... and mebbe some more epsom salts to help with the after-effects of practicing.
