President Bush expanded the federal budget by a historic $700 billion through 2008. President Obama would add another $1 trillion.

President Bush began a string of expensive finan*cial bailouts. President Obama is accelerating that course.

President Bush created a Medicare drug entitle*ment that will cost an estimated $800 billion in its first decade. President Obama has proposed a $634 billion down payment on a new govern*ment health care fund.

President Bush increased federal education spending 58 percent faster than inflation. Presi*dent Obama would double it.

President Bush became the first President to spend 3 percent of GDP on federal antipoverty programs. President Obama has already in*creased this spending by 20 percent.

President Bush tilted the income tax burden more toward upper-income taxpayers. President Obama would continue that trend.

President Bush presided over a $2.5 trillion increase in the public debt through 2008. Setting aside 2009 (for which Presidents Bush and Obama share responsibility for an additional $2.6 trillion in public debt), President Obamas budget would add $4.9 trillion in public debt from the beginning of 2010 through 2016.

As to... "Why didn't we hear about the deficit during the Bush administration?"

Answer - You didn't read the NYT or WaPo or the internet? You did not watch CNN or FOX News? In other words, what's this "we" stuff kemosabe?

I don't know where your graph is from but it's not accurate.

Can you explain where the 6 trillion dollars is in that graph? because it shows less than that, and the national debt grew by 6 trillion during the Bush years.

As I noted, the graph is from the left of center Washington Post.

The link would have provided you with another aid too...

UPDATE: Many Obama defenders in the comments are claiming that the numbers above do not include spending on Iraq and Afghanistan during the Bush years. They most certainly do. While Bush did fund the wars through emergency supplementals (not the regular budget process), that spending did not simply vanish. It is included in the numbers above. Also, some Obama defenders are claiming the graphic above represents biased Heritage Foundation numbers. While we stand behind the numbers we put out 100%, the numbers, and the graphic itself, above are from the Washington Post. We originally left out the link to WaPo. It has been now been added.

CLARIFICATION: Of course, this Washington Post graphic does not perfectly delineate budget surpluses and deficits by administration. President Bush took office in January 2001, and therefore played a lead role in crafting the FY 2002-2008 budgets. Presidents Bush and Obama share responsibility for the FY 2009 budget deficit that overlaps their administrations, before President Obama assumes full budgetary responsibility beginning in FY 2010. Overall, President Obamas budget would add twice as much debt as President Bush over the same number of years.

In short, the "Bush" deficit was terrible and the "Obama" deficit will be much worse.

Oh, but we did, ad nauseum.... Every time lib cryasses bitched and moaned about "tax cuts for the rich".

Nevermind that the tax cuts were pretty puny in the grand scheme of things and that the debt had been on track to explode starting in 2003, for about 20 years.

</quote>

Bush's tax cuts for the rich cost us almost a trillion dollars of deficit spending. Bush never paid for those tax cuts.

You think a trillion dollars is puny?

You think it's cryasses bitching and moaning about deficit spending?

What happened to fiscally responsible Republicans?

That's the myth that's been busted. There's been no such Republicans since the Reagan admin.

what about his tax cuts for the middle class and poor? i'm not rich and they saved me $2400 last year.

I didn't get a tax cut. What was yours in, capital gains?

<quote orig_author="rdean">
During the Bush years, the cost of both wars was never included in the budget. As soon as Obama took office, both wars were suddenly included, which of course made the true deficit skyrocket.

Also, Bush, as with most Republicans, used what is called, "creative bookkeeping". Projecting revenues or savings that "might" happen into a "real" budget.

Only Republicans believe that we can fight two wars, cut taxes, cut education, shift the tax burden to the middle class, send jobs overseas and the result will be a "growing and robust economy". I just don't get it. Then when their "mess" doesn't work, they complain it wasn't "true conservatism".

Can you say the 'Enron Accounting Method'. After all, 'Kenny Boy' was one of Dubya's best friends and business partners.

Obama campaigned on getting rid of wasteful spending.

</quote>

Then he turned around and signed a nearly $1 trillion un-stimulating succubus package and an omnibus bill with 1,500 pet pork projects in it.

....Pants on fire.....
