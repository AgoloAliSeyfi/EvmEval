Sky, what junta? This is not Myanmar.

Although he has some faults, Thaksin was democratically elected twice, and was disposed as PM while in office. He is now in excile.

The current PM Abhisit has not been elected at an election. It is not sure how much he can control the army.

The Thai people have very high regard for the King. He has called for unity.

Oh sorry, sir, I was talking about the junta in Burma. I always refer to them as the junta <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/redface.gif"/>

Abhisit could certainly wag the dog and lord knows there is enough bad blood between the two nations given border disputes and the Karen refugees. I was thinking of the recent flare up in Kokang.

The 'Red Shirt' rally on Sunday is postponed to a date after a new law on military action expires. Analysis think Thaksin wants to force a new election which his Party is expected to win.

<quote>
BANGKOK, Aug 29 (Reuters) - "Red shirt" supporters of ousted Thai premier Thaksin Shinawatra have postponed Sunday's planned rally outside the office of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva because of a tight security law passed this week.

The United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD) said it would hold the rally on Sept. 5, four days after the new law expires, instead.

The law passed on Tuesday allows the military to act fast if protests turn violent, without declaring a state of emergency. At least 5,000 troops were on standby ahead of the rally.....

The prospect of more demonstrations will add to fears of an escalation in Thailand's four-year political crisis, and may dent the confidence of investors and tourists, hampering Abhisit's efforts to revive the economy....

Abhisit told reporters the security law would remain effective until Tuesday, and the government would discuss what to do with it at a cabinet meeting the same day.....

The UDD's three-week occupation of the seat of government in April led to Thailand's worst street violence in 17 years, forcing Abhisit to call a state of emergency, triggering concern about the stability of Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy.....

Analysts say Thaksin is seeking to discredit Abhisit and his squabbling coalition to force new elections, which the pro-Thaksin Puea Thai party is widely expected to win, albeit without an outright majority....

<quote>
4 Sept [NYTimes] PAKA LUE SONG, Thailand -.... Paka Lue Song, only a 15-minute drive from the provincial capital, Pattani, is a starting point for Thailands influx of troops into the countrys troubled southern provinces, where ethnic Malay Muslims are battling for autonomy from Thailands Buddhist majority.

The number of people in security forces, including the army, the police and militias, in the region has doubled over the past two years to about 60,000, said Srisompob Jitpiromsri, a leading expert on the insurgency and the associate dean at Prince of Songkla University in Pattani.

The huge increase in security forces initially helped reduce the violence as well as the death toll, which fell by 40 percent last year. But the number of killings has risen in recent months. More than 330 people have been killed so far this year, compared with 285 in the same period last year. Among the dead are civilians  including many Malays  soldiers and insurgents.

There have been so many killings in the three southern provinces  about 3,500 since 2004  that the government began distributing a glossy brochure last year guiding victims families through the process of applying for government compensation.

Although the insurgency has been active for decades in the south, the current phase is considered particularly dangerous because the militants appear to have more of an Islamist agenda and because apparently sectarian attacks have strained the mutual tolerance between Buddhists and Muslims. It also comes at a time of deep political turmoil and social unease in Thailand that has hobbled several governments in the last three years and last year drove away many of the tourists who help sustain the countrys economy.

The surge in troops is palpable across the three southern provinces, only a few hours drive from Thailands main tourist beaches. There is now the equivalent of one soldier or police officer for every seven households. Soldiers in Humvees patrol the main roads, and police and military checkpoints screen motorists every few miles.

The insurgency has been distinct from other rebel movements in the region because the perpetrators remain shadowy, ill-defined groups that do not claim responsibility for the violence. Experts say they believe that the aims of the groups, among them the Pattani Islamic Mujahedeen Movement and the National Revolution Front-Coordinate, are to drive Buddhists from the area, discredit the government and put into place strict Islamic laws.

Although they say they believe that some financing for the groups comes from abroad, several counterterrorism experts in Thailand and elsewhere discount significant connections with other militant movements, like Al Qaeda and the Indonesian group Jemaah Islamiyah. The movement here, they say, appears to involve a localized struggle over territory and control overlaid with historical resentment over the domination of the Thai state.

Malay Muslims make up about 80 percent of the 1.7 million people living in Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala Provinces.....
