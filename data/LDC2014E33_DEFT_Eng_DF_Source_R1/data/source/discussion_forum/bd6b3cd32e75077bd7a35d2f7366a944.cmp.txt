I have no tolerance for right-wing conservatives. I show breitbart, in death, the same respect he showed Shirley Sherrod.

I'm glad he's dead.

Of course you are. You're a prick.

</quote>

And breitbart is an early grave having cracker. Hahahaha.

I wonder if the gravedigger tossed a copy of the Sherrod video in the grave with breitbart?

</quote>

Show respect for the deceased. A hideous view of a human's death is not something to celebrate!

Remember, "every man's death diminishes me"? My mother paraphrased it; it was her favorite quote. The lawn jockey remarks made me think of Flannery O'Connor's short story whose title I will not write here.

Ahhh, yes, a paranoid racist moron. No wonder you admire him.

I don't admire anyone, but myself. I don't believe in any religion or numerology. I just pointed out how tolerance gets you killed.

tolerance didn't get them killed.

intolerance did.

These people are swine. I can't find the words. I'll just get you the link. And when ever you hear anyone from our side say we have to reach out and work with anyone on the left, I hope you're close enough to give that person a freaking knuckle sandwich.

According to The Daily Caller,

Although the news of Andrew Breitbarts death is still fairly fresh, the merry band of faceless marauders at the Daily Kos have decided it is time to use his death as an opportunity to make political hay.

A post dated March 1 by dragon82a, titled Lets Help Andrew Breitbart go out In Style..Get Westboro Baptist Church to Protest Him encourages readers to post on the Westboro Baptist Churchs Facebook page calling for the group to protest Andrew Breitbarts funeral:

Here is the Facebook of the WestBoro Baptist Church:

Send them a message anything will do, about how much publicity they would get by Protecting Andrew.

<a href="http://www.facebook.com/">http://www.facebook.com/</a>

Lets give back to Andrew what he has so generously given to us all these years.

We could call this Operation Sendaway

well, if dragon82a said it, you should certainly attribute his words to the entire homogenous left that you believe exists.

You're not missing much. It's a lot of procedural disputes and whining.

</quote>

THAT I am used to by virtue of my occupation. ; ) Seriously, celebrating the death of Breitbart is mean. ( I made one smart crack when Reagan was shot; my parents, neither of whom liked Reagan, read me the riot act for DAYS. I learned from it.

<img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> It is funny to see you getting all hissy about the homogenization..... since you do the same thing pretty consistently to the right.

And... as an aside... I notice you do not condemn the Daily Crap for their pathetic campaign. Nice.... really.... way to claim the moral highground, mo chara.
