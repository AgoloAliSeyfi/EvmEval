SOME things that governmenht do, they do very well.

I do not think that nationaling the assets of oil compnaies is remotely a good idea, though.

There might be one way to test that theory, though., and no nationalization of private peroperty is necessary

The USA still owns plenty of land and offshore locations where there's oil.

Instead of selling the right to drill to a private company, let the government try to set up its own oil company.

I suspect that the oil won't be brought up out of the ground any more chearply than the private companies do it.

by nationalizing, the prices would absolutely go, down because if we the people being the govenment decide that oil needs to break even and the government doesn't need to make a profit then the price will definitally go down. Gas will become cheaper when it comes to the profit margin.

The government doesn't have a profit motive. They don't care whether they make a profit, break even, or go in the red. They will simply spend the entire budget allocation on oil production and whether or not its financially efficient will be of no concern to them because another budget will be passed with another allocation in the future.

Funding would come from tax dollars, which are theoretically available forever. So if money is lost producing oil, who cares, there's money available forever. As long as oil is being provided, right? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/>

You could always ASSUME that people would keep the system running properly through their due diligence and their vote, but I don't see that happening anywhere else with government spending so why think it would be different with government-run oil production?

I'd go out on a limb and say the oil industry is already nationalized.

It's become pretty obvious now that the government will financially back stop big companies in the event that they face bankruptcy. So if Exxon makes a bunch of stupid mistakes and loses their ass, our tax dollars will prop them up anyway.

This way, we don't actually have to CALL it nationalization.
