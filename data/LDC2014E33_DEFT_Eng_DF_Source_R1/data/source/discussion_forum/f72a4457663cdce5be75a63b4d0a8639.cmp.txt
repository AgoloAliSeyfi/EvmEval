<quote orig_author="Mimi Arc en ciel">
My SIL has had her children removed from her care. Each had different fathers, All other's have gone to their dads except two. One is with a family memeber and SIL would like me to have the other child - Legally/Officially - so that SIL will still have contact. She has a fortnight to submit to social services her choice and i'm the only one in the family who could have the child otherwise the child will go into the system and be adopted. Child is a few weeks old. I've not even seen the child (removed from SIL at birth by social services) so have no bond with the child.

I currently have 1 DD and we are trying for another (It has only been a few months though of trying so am not pregnant) SIL knows we are trying and see's this as a "you want a kid - have mine!"

Whats making the decision difficult is There is a chance this child might have a mental disability (they cant test yet as too young ??) I know my SIL will not back off and let me be a parent to this child no matter what the courts say/put in place and i think that will cause problems. SIL is also saying she wont come around unless its "convieniant" for me - But i have a horrible feeling she will be here constant and I dont want that. It would unsettle me, the child and also my DD.

Half of me is screaming to take the child as, after all, it's family.

Other half is yearing for "my" child.

Some of you may already know this is something i've been thinking about for a bit now. I said no to SIL as I dont think I could cope having her in my ear all the time and this would divide the family but She's been nagging me and wearing me down and now I'm half and half.

OH say's he'll support me no matter what I decide but I know he would like a child of his own (DD is not his although he treats her as his) and to be fair, I'd like my "own" and this child will never be "mine" (Think of "normal" adoption - That child has a "mum" and a "dad" where as I'd be "aunty" with "mum" and "dad" visiting)

Mum's just been, she said SIL is on her way to "discuss things" - Mum's already told her to stop pressuring me as I'd already said no.

I could support the child (Other wise i wouldnt be trying for my own!) but its the whole maternal thing - That child will never be mine and I couldn't bring it up as my own

I guess what I'm looking for is advice. I know this may split people and I may get some backlash from people who cant have kids or who have been trying for a while and I truly am sorry if this upsets anyone, But i simply dont know what to do. <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/frown.gif"/>

Hi OP - what an uneviable position to be in <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/frown.gif"/> your words I've highlighted in bold say it all really.
From what you've posted so far it sounds to me that it wouldn't be in the best interests for your family or the child if you were to take them in

Mimi, you know yourself better than anyone else and you know where your own limits are. If you feel that you can't cope with having SIL hanging on the bell all week, trying to dictate (as it sounds that's exactly what she'll be trying to do), then there's no shame in that. If you and your OH feel that you want a child of your own, then I don't think either of you are being selfish.

From what you say, your SIL sounds quite controlling and I think it's possible her child would be better off totally away from the family entirely and away from her influence.

I do agree with elvis86, once she's got her foot in the door, it'll be hard to keep her at a distance you're comfortable with.

I wish you all the best, whatever you decide. *hugs*
