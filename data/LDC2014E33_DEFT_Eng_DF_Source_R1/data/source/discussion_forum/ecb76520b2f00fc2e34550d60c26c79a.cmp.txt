We can increase our production of solar electricity 20% annually for at least a decade with large subsidies.We need super conducting high tension lines to bring the electricity to customers in less sunny locations before solar can provide 5% of the world's energy needs. I have not heard of any progress in super conductors the last ten years.
Hydrogen can fill perhaps 1% of the world's energy needs, but will be extremely costly if we try for much more than 1%. Every little bit helps IMHO, so we should go with hydrogen. Tokyo, Japan has made a major commitment to hydrogen, so Tokyo 1% maybe.
There are perhaps 100 other alternate energy ideas, but the others look less promising, as near as I can guess, so some help from the aliens = ET,if any, would be appreciated. Near term, our best bet is to make products that last for centuries instead of months.
Decades ago, we thought we could make electricity by burning trash, but it turns out the flue gases have dioxin if there are any chlorine compounds in the trash. Dioxin reduces human life expectancy and quality of life even at one part per billion. Presently most paper and some plastic contains chlorine. Please comment refute or embellish. Neil

alternative energy
my guess is the thousand large mirrors aimed at a steam boiler is our best bet, but cleaning the mirrors will be labor intensive.
One has operated for about 30 years and several are under construction that are somewhat different.
Another is a giant green house with a mile high chimney which turns wind turbines. I think it produces less energy than the mirrors unless the chimney is extremely tall.
At a few locations (top of a ridge) Wind turbines are making electricity when the wind blows. Denmark has made a big commitment to wind turbines, but most locations the wind does not blow often enough.
Every few months someone claims they are about to make cheap solar panels = photovoltaic,but one square yard still costs about $150 and makes a dimes worth of electricity per day under the sunniest conditions.

Ive heard of microwave transmission of energy using incredibly straight tunnels. I wonder if somewhere there isnt some research being done? I get the SCience and Technology Magazine ferom Lawrence Livermore, Its a free to the trade mag, very good and reflects one labs output.

As far as burning trash, I remember the trash to ethanol projects. It went nowhere.

as far as TCDD, the bad thing is that any TCDD congener with a molecular multiple of 7, is the real culprit. Fortunately the Kd of tCDDs and PCBs and Chlorodibenzofurans are really high, so its easy to capture the stuff in the stack, or develop a super heater, in which the molecules are destroyed as part of the combustion cycle. Ive lost track of the tech because weve moved to other tricks in ore beneficiation, so I have to admit Im rusty on latest adsorption technology

Neil, You have two threads with the same name. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_question.gif" alt="Question"/> <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_question.gif" alt="Question"/>.

I commented on the other one and referred you to a couple of points of interest.

Re Photo Voltaics. I think that your economics are a little off but if I paid $150.00 for a panel that made a dimes worth of electricity per day it would have a payback time of approximately 41 years. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad"/>

Next year the panel will cost $120.00 and the electricity will be worth $0.12. for a payback time of less than 30 years. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused"/>

It happens even faster if you use the panels for a roof on your house. Deduct the cost of the roof from the cost of the panels and your payback comes down to 10 years or so. Thats on a par with fossil fuels now and probably has something to do with the proliferation of sellers of Photo Voltaic panels today. Even J.C.Whitney can sell you one suitable to keep your batteries charged. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"/>

<img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea"/> Pay attention to your philosophers. Adam Smith and Maltheus have some rather accurate views on the subject despite despite the 2 or 3 hundred years that have passed since they made their observations. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"/>

ARE PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS oops, getting better? I have a couple of banks on my RV and they keep the4 drydock batteries charged nicely I can go indefinately on my own power if I dont use the airconditioning or the microwave.. I cannot develop a huge amp surge to run heavy appliances (and of course theres the Alternating current problem) ive wanted to change over the photovoltaics if there are any new techs that apply. Any ideas? Rvers are the most energy mizerly doofii around. We squeeze the amps and get change.
