I can come back and admit that I'm wrong, but I'll need to give my perspective first, as there are many perspectives on what is going to happen. It's important to understand this because it does no good to broad brush everyone into the same camp, for example, some believe that it will on crash on that one day. Others, like myself, believe that the day will probably serve as a peak in energies, or a marker, but on either side of the day will be a rising and falling of negative events.

Total chaos would take your list and multiply it a few times. Not just collapses, but complete collapses, 10's of millions to billions dead or dying from starvation, war, disaster, etc. Life as we know it grinding to a halt, with no bounce back on the horizon.

The pattern of events in recent years, to me, points in this direction. We have more wars and more to come, the cost of living is jumping at record pace (I just saw a Red Barron's pizza....... on sale for $6!), there are increasing crop failures, our 'mortal enemy', China, has strings attached to darn near everything we buy, do and use.

It's not looking good. We've got the government engaging in more and more outreach to people, trying to get the to disaster prep, e.g., earthquake drills, and I just heard this morning that Saturday morning cartoons were covering disaster preps!

More wars? The world has never had such a long peaceful stretch since we began recording history. Casualties of the last few wars (iraq, afghanistan etc) number in the tens of thousands of civilians and thousands of soldiers over the course of a decade. Tragic for the individuals concerned, but a pittance compared to the scale of deaths in the wars fought in the world since ancient times.

Cost of living rising and you point to a 6$ pizza? You do know that you also have to take into account the rise in income? And then you'll find that maybe its risen a bit since the current crisis, but if you compare it to cost of living in 1912 I suspect you'll find nearly everyone nearly everywhere has it better than then.
