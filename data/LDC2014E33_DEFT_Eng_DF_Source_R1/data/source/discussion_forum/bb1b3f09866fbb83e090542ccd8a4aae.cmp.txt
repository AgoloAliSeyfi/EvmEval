sure, it's a study run by some religious wingnut zealot at some christian cow college, but it seems that abstinence only sex education is much more effective in preventing teen pregnancies and STDs than either traditional general health courses or courses that focus on safe sex.
it should also be noted that abstinence in this case does not refer to abstinence until marriage.

next thing you know, there'll be pictures of dinosaurs with jesus. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eek.gif"/>

A study of middle-school students that found for the first time that abstinence-only education helped to delay their sexual initiation is already beginning to shake up the longstanding debate over how best to prevent teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.

This is a rigorous study that means we can now say that its possible for an abstinence-only intervention to be effective, Dr. John B. Jemmott III, the University of Pennsylvania professor who led the study, said Tuesday, hours after results of the study were released. Thats important, because for some populations, abstinence is the only acceptable message.

In Dr. Jemmotts research, only about a third of the students who participated in a weekend abstinence-only class started having sex within the next 24 months, compared with about half who were randomly assigned instead to general health information classes, or classes teaching only safer sex. Among those assigned to comprehensive sex-education classes, covering both abstinence and safer sex, about 42 percent began having sex.

What study or research has there ever been into the validity of a teenager answering a question about sex?
None of these studies are valid. Teenagers lie.
