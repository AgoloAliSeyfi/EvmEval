Maybe before complaining about immigrants not speaking English, you should learn to spell. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/>

But the point is that we have people already here who will need jobs either right now or in the future. And it's not just skilled jobs but also unskilled jobs. Any skilled foreigner can arrive in this country and take unskilled work, and they often do. This increases the competition for jobs, and there is also an assumption that Brits are lazy; all Brits, which is just not true.

Also, in my experience, foreign workers take two or more jobs to bump up their income. There is no law against this, but it does push out further those people who have no job and need a job; just one job. For every foreign worker who takes two jobs, for example, two British workers are left without a chance of a job. Is that fair?

I don't think so. It has nothing to do with being British or being foreign; it has to do with fairness. There is already a growing need for jobs; there is already fierce competition for jobs without the need for foreigners coming here and applying for jobs which only serves to increase the competition.

This is what creates this tension with foreign workers. Yes, they are hard working, and yes, some of us Brits are not as motivated to keep or get a job, but some of us do show motivation and some of us see that the work we can do is being taken by foreigners who should actually not contribute to the increase in competition and therefore sideline those who are in need of work. It is unfair to those who really are seeking employment. It may be good for the economy but it is not fair on those who feel the brunt end of fierce competition for jobs, especially when there is this notion of "lazy Brits" hanging over their heads like an extra black cloud.

I don't think most British people are too lazy to work but I think they have unrealistic expectations of work. Lots of Brits think they are too good to pick vegetables, work in a noisy factory or put up with the tedium of most office or shop work.

They want an interesting job with good pay and prospects but don't have the qualifications or experience. I don't think most Brits want to start at the bottom and do tedious low paid jobs before they get the experience to climb up the career ladder.

Immigrants will do the low paid tedious jobs and lots of industries like farming and cleaning have to rely on them. If they weren't avialable, lots of farms and cleaning firms would become uneconomical and would shrink or close down and deprive the country of taxes.

Employers are pragmatic, they don't care if someone is British of foriegn as long as they work hard and are reliable.

How does it affect you if people are speaking to each other in a different language? What does keeping England English even mean?
