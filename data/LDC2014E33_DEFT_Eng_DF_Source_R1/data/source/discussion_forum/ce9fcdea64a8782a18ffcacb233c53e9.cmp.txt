The Catholic Church is opposed to contraception for moral reasons.

Where is the morality in creating a life when food and clean water are rare commodities? Where poverty exists and educational opportunities are non existent?

Where is the morality when disease is spread?

Where is the morality when a women is the victim of domestic violence? When a women is forced to conceive and then trapped as the child become a lever to gain more power and more control?

The Churches take on morality is theirs and theirs alone. As for the birth control issue-

As to the food and water issue, The Catholic Church alone, has done more to get more food and water to starving people then you have or ever will. Its there right to provide there employees what the will.

The point I made regarding food and clean water, as well as disease, was focused specifically on current events in Africa. Not only is the Catholic Church opposed to contraception but the Bush Adminsitrtion was opposed to any efforts to protect pregnanat women (and their unborn children) from disease - water born &amp; AIDS - and poor prenatal nutrition.

I have no doubt the Catholic Church engages in good works and I have no problem with their moral objection to abortion. What I object to, strongly, is stupidity. How is preventing a child's conception a moral issue and how is it any business of the church. The answer is quite simple, more births = more Catholics = more power and money.

What the frack have you been smoking? The Bush administration expanded aid to Africa and threw a lot of money behind the effort to stop the spread of AIDS. He did a lot of things wrong, but that is one thing he got right, you should give yourself a wedgie for lying about it.

By the way, how is a preventing pregnancy not a moral issue? Do you think it was immoral for the US government to sterilize people without their knowledge simply because many progressives thought it was a good idea?

The Catholic church should concern themselves with trying to keep their house in order.
The pervert priests throughout the existence of the church should be of greater concern than what people think about contraception.

Fortunately the Catholic Church has been losing its power, and because of the pervert priest scandals, its money for some time now.

They are nothing more than hypocrites in a big way.

Contraception is about responsible parenthood. Why would Republicans choose to make it an issue in an election year is beyond me.

For some reason, anything having to do with sex puts them in a tizzy

Republicans did not, and are not, making contraception an issue.

Republicans are against women's health because they don't believe government should provide them with free contraception with money confiscated by government guns.

You don't think that's making contraception an issue? Seriously?

All that for a little pill?
