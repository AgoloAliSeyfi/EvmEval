<quote>
Ruggeri called the watch desk at ZNY, and was informed from Bruce Barrett that the [first] impact was a terrorist event. Barrett checked a Situational Display per Ruggeri's request.to locate AA 11, and it showed AA 11 in Whiskey 105 but on a coast track (since the computer was searching for the target, and projecting its flight path).

</quote>
So there were some people thinking "terrorist attack" immediately, even after the first impact. And just because something is on the TSD, doesn't mean it's still flying.

He adds this thought:

<quote>
Ruggeri noted that he holds the belief that the hijackers of UAL 93 overheard a FAA controller mentioning there was "something" approaching VAL 93's location "moving quickly", and that the hijackers thought this was a military response. Thus the hijackers crashed the aircraft.

She indicated that she had never seen security at the airport as
rigorous as it was on the morning of 9/11 (prior to the attacks in the United States). She said that the authorities double and triple checked passports., The atmosphere was tense and the security people appeared to be on a high level of alert.. "They obviously 'knew something was going on." (This took place prior to the attacks in the United States later that day).

And offcourse completely fail to explain what the link is between a hightened level of security on a Paris airport in the morning, with the attacks that occured in the US later that afternoon (CET).

<a href="http://media.nara.gov/9-11/MFR/t-0148-911MFR-01062.pdf">Suntrust bankers</a> partly explain a story about a security alert raised against al-Shehhi in June 2001 (although the mystery about why it was deleted remains):

<quote>
1. All documents (other than account statements) related to the June 11,2001 intemal "Security Alert" concerning Marwan AI-Shehhi.

Answer. As described below, the Security Alert dated June 11, 2001 was in fact a routine internal notice intended to protect the Bank from a financial loss related to a potential unauthorized transaction in a customer account. It did not relate in any way to a suspicion of more nefarious activity on the part of our customer.

On June 11,2001, Linda Gurney, who was employed at SunTrust's South Florida Security Services department, issued an email "Security Alert" to all SunTrust branch managers in South Florida, a copy of which is attached as Tab A. The alert described an unsuccessful attempt that day by "Marwan Alshehhi";' SunTrust Account No. 0573000259772, to cash a check for $2,818.00, at the Linton Avenue branch in Del Ray, Florida. The alert indicated that there were numerous inconsistencies between addresses attributed to Alshehhi from records on file at the bank and identification documents that were produced at the time the check was presented. The alert also indicated that the bank had placed a hold on his account. It warned managers in the South Florida area to "beware" of this activity in case Mr. Alshehhi attempted to cash the same check in another branch.

A companion computerized hold was placed that day on SunTrust's electronic teller information system for one month, from June 11, 2001 to July. 11, 2001.2 Under SunTrust's computerized system, any time a teller accessed Mr. Alshehhi's account number, the teller would be instructed to contact "Lisa" at SunTrust's Venice, Florida branch, where the account was opened. The computer instructions also indicated that there was a question about Mr. Alshehhi' s identification. The alert was deleted from the computerized system on June 12, 2001. Over the past several days, we have been able to reconstruct both the computerized alert, attached as Tab B, and a record of its deletion, at Tab C. However, we are unable to determine who deleted the alert or why it was deleted.

<quote>
Talbott noted the amount of criticism the administration endured for going after UBL that August [1998, post the Embassy bombings]. To him this was ridiculous given the fact that Americans had been killed. He noted that it took a 9-11 to bring the "national political will" to mobilize and support the type of military response seen today. He agreed that a 9-11 response required a 9-11 event.
