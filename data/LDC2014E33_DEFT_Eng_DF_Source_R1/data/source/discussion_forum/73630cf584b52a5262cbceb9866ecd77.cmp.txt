My biggest disappointment with Obama is that, in negotiations, he tends to give too much to the GOP in hopes that they'll be fair and willing partners in governance. I realize that he's trying to appeal to the middle, but at some point he's got to say enough is enough (which he SEEMS to be doing now - we'll see). If he didn't already know it, he should know by now that the GOP is not the least bit interested in compromise.

You mean like Obamacare? Give some examples of this. It just shows how looney left you are. Obama is the most divisive bitterly partisan President in my lifetime, and that's up against some pretty stiff competition.

Really? How old are you? I'd have to say Nixon was the most divisive one I've ever lived through. Do you have some examples of how bitterly divisive Obama has been?

Actually, the fact that you think Obama, who is quite conservative in his governance as Democrats go, is some kind of extreme left-wing ideologue, shows how looney right YOU are.

Nice diversion. Try answering the question.

I agree. Either Kaz thinks George W. Bush is a centrist, or Kaz is a child.

I wonder which it is.

You talk like he could have passed a public option Bill. He didn't have the votes from his own party for that. He had to bribe to get the Bill passed that he has.

And to what extent?

I think Obama has undeniably accomplished a lot in his first 3 years, but his over-reliance on diplomacy with Republicans has impeded critical progress.

I'm sure the cons/repubs on here are undoubtedly going to answer this question too, but at least try and be mature about it...

Obama should have invoked the 14th Amendment during the made-up debt crisis created by the Teapubs. He should have kept the Public Option on the table too. The Dems need to stop compromising when it's clear the other side has no intention of doing so. He'd better not compromise and give in to the pipeline if the Repubs attach it to the payroll tax cuts. I've been pretty pleased with Obama on the whole but if he caves on that one too, damn I'm gonna be pissed.

Yeah! it would be a fucking shame to put 20 thousand Americans to work and to find a source that isn't Arab.. we got it. we fucking got it. asswipe.

In this case, you mean Canada's got it. Yeah, it would be a shame to spend all that time and money investing in a filthy, polluting energy source instead of spending time and money on cleaner, cheaper alternatives.
Funny how the House Repubs are fired up all of sudden about jobs when they haven't given a shit about jobs since they took the majority.
