First thing. The Atomic Bombs were not ready until Summer 1945. Germany surrendered in April. We had no reason to drop said bombs on Germany.

The reality is that it took BOTH bombs to get the Emperor of Japan to over ride his Army Controlled Government and order an immediate surrender. With those bombs we would have starved Japan through the winter killing untold thousands followed by an Invasion of a Home Island which would have seen MILLIONS of dead Japanese civilians and soldiers.

Japan was teaching her civilians to arm themselves with Bamboo spears and human wave charge any invasion. The continued invasion of Japan could have seen the potential elimination of the Japanese race.

The lie that Japan was ready to surrender is revisionist history. Japan under the Army had no intention of surrender. What they "offered" through the Soviet Union was a cease fire with Japan keeping everything she still possessed and the return of Japanese home possessions like Saipan and Okinawa. Japan was offering to let us just stop attacking them. They would retain all of their Chinese, Korean and other possessions and we would return their home island captures.

Here is a link to SOURCE documents verifying that Japan was NOT offering a meaningful surrender, that even after two atomic Bombs the Army controlled government refused to surrender, that the Emperor failed to act until after the second atomic bomb and that the Army attempted a Coup to prevent the Emperor from surrendering.

The atomic bombs were necessary unless one thinks we should have just let Japan keep everything from before the war and not disarm. They SAVED millions of lives.

You're full of shit. The proof is not in what you stated, it is what you completely avoided. There are two simple yet often overlooked fundamental aspects that prove the bombs were not meant to get Japan to surrender.

(1) We had their offer to surrender before we dropped the bombs. It was the same offer we accepted after we targeted civilians with the A-bombs and dropped them.

(2) The bombs were not dropped to intimidate Japan. There were dropped to intimidate Russia.

Straight up LIE. Provide a single source to your claim the Japanese offered unconditional Surrender before the Emperor ordered it AFTER 2 Atomic Bombs.

I have in the source documents the actual meetings of the Japanese Government and their refusal to surrender after the first bomb and their refusal after the second until the Emperor intervened.

Midcan makes a good point. If you are one of the dead, how it happened is no longer of any interest.

We did have the history of the way the Japanese were fighting. We were looking at civilian casualties in the range of 65-95% For the living on both sides, the bomb was a lifesaver. But we aren't ever going to fight a war with an enemy like that again. And we have never fought a war in that manner since.

The reasons the cliche "The bombs saved lives" are many of the same reasons Bush supporters were reduced to defending Bush by saying "History will prove him correct."

Well, it's been a year. What say you? He still seems like a lying fuckwhit to me.

And the sad thing is, while he lied about Iraq having the A-Bomb, it now appears he failed to stop IRAN from getting it. Oh joy.

Bush never claimed Iraq had a bomb. That is left wing lying at its finest. As for stopping Iran, are you saying we were wrong for stopping Iraq from returning to research on the bomb by invading but we should have invaded Iran?

The Japanese had several negotiated settlements on the table. None of them conformed to the conditions set out and agreed to by the allies.

</quote>

The surrender offered by Japan prior to the bombs is the same surrender we accepted after the bombs.

</quote>

You are a LIAR. Provide a source document. I have provided a SOURCE document of the Japanese Governments meetings and then did not offered to surrender at all before either bomb was dropped. They offered through the Soviets to end the war in place exchanging territory they captured for territory we captured. After the first bomb they offered much the same.

Provide us a link to a source document.

One of you is right and the other is wrong...on the facts.

Is there no good source document to go look-see who's right, namvet? Has there never been a proceeding in the Hague or any sort of international court?

I GAVE you a link to SOURCE DOCUMENTS. They INCLUDE the Japanese Governments meetings involving just this. READ them.

After Japanese leaders flatly rejected the Potsdam Declaration President Truman authorized use of the atomic bomb anytime after August 3, 1945.
