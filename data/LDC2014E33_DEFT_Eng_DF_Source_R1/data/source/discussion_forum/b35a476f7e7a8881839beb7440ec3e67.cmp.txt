I apologise in advance if there is something similar to this thread, but this is a topic that has interested me recently and would just like to hear your views on the matter.
I'm a British Pakistani, born and brought up in London, however I would say I am very much in touch with my roots and my views lean more towards the traditional and conservative side. Recently I watched a documentary by Saira Khan 'Don't tell my Mother I am in Pakistan', made a few years ago, yet a very interesting watch. I have been on holiday to Pakistan a fair amount of times, and have traveled throughout the country, so I thought I had a pretty accurate idea of the country as a whole and it's people. However, after watching the documentary and various other programs and films on Pakistan I am absolutely shocked. I may be wrong when I say this, but was Pakistan not founded as a Muslim state, yet only 64 years on and I don't think the country matches the vision it was initially created with. It seems that the higher class are obsessed with imitating and adopting western culture, in a sense it boosts their superiority complex. I actually find it shocking, that most families who moved to England in the 60's like my grandfather have managed to maintain that cultural pride and certain traditions that have been lost among certain groups of people in Pakistan. Drinking is a common practice with the upper class society and personally I find it quite upsetting, it seems as if Pakistan is moving in the opposite direction- the rich becoming more obsessed with western culture and the less well off being neglected further. Also whilst I'm on this topic, has anyone seen the film 'Slackistan' and what were your views?

The westernisation of anything muslim can only be a good thing, western economy, culture and society is way advanced and more civilised and humane.

We're talking about India here, not Ireland. My knowledge of Ireland and the situation there is not really good enough to debate on the subject.

I know, just pointing out that Britain has been known to use some vicious sectarian-inciting policies. They sought to maintain confusion and violence in Ireland by pitting various local religious strands against each other, to stop them from uniting against British rule. Just a side note, do carry on.

At the time, an India that includes present day Pakistan would have been ruled by the Hindu majority Indian National Congress, which Muslims feared would totally ignore their rights and wants, with the added context of widespread sectarian violence, that is why Muslims felt they must have a seperate NAtion. Also, the INC rejected various proposals at federal deals and so forth.

Really, thats just bogus, as threat of secretarian violence had the Apostles of pacifism in Congress surrendering to the great evil of partition, the very thing they wanted to avoid, so are these leaders the type to impose, please.....No Hindu majority due to caste divisions, so who is majority?
Again USA model would have been best option, with stong regional states with regional laws and a weak centre.Majority of people 1947 did not want partition
India has as many Muslim faith people as Pakistan, so what was the point jeez.

Anyway whats done is done, this is just discussion over something that highly unlikely will ever be reversed, unlike Germany, so better if Pakistan and India can get along and workk for the betterment of the common people, like sewers, better roads, hunger, this is what unites people, regardless of what faith, feeding your family...

Frankly, I'm all for the balanced 'westernisation' if that's what you want to call it.
I call it freedom, that just so by happened to be promoted by the Western media.
