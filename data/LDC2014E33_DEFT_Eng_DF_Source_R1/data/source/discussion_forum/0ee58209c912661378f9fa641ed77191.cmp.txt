"If you run a giant bank that defrauds millions of small investors of their life savings, the bank might pay a small fine but you wont go to prison. Not a single top Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for Wall Streets mega-fraud. But if you sell an ounce of marijuana you could be put away for a long time."

Financial "success" isn't a good thing if it comes from Wall Street speculation or if you obtain it by accepting bribes from speculators. A wall between private wealth and the state is long overdue; however, I doubt elected Republicans OR Democrats would agree.

In the last three decades or so, income inequality has been growing. While wages are being driven down for a number of reasons, corporate executives are taking ever larger pay and benefit packages, even when they drive their respective companies into the ditch.

Now, here's a question that I would like someone to seriously try to answer: Why is it that TALKING about income inequality qualifies as class warfare against the rich, but income inequality, itself, isn't considered class warfare against the poor and middle classes?

Possibly because for thousands of years the richest members of any society, those who loan money at interest, have consolidated government's power for their own selfish ends. Even the American Revolution didn't change that dynamic very much; central bankers don't really have to worry about who's elected to office as long as the private creation and allocation of credit remains safely in their hands.

OWS has already launched the class war into the consciousness of millions of Americans.
Events coming up next summer at the Democrat and Republican Conventions could provoke your question onto the public stage during the closing months of a US Presidential campaign.

If the US economy is swirling the same drain in 2012 as it was in 2008 millions of voters, whose ranks may be swelled by additional millions of eligible voters who don't usually bother casting a ballot, might decide a "choice" between Republican OR Democrat is really no choice at all when it comes to class war.

The poor fighting over a chance to spend $180.00 on a pair of sneakers. How poor can they BE?

Here's a hint. Don't go into debt! Oh my garsh! What a novel concept! Take away their method of making money and they lose their power.

What a bunch of maroons you are.
