In addition to the adultery?

Newt is one of those guys who says he loves America but seems to hate Americans.

In the 1990's there was a news story about a woman whose baby was cut out of her belly. The rest of us were recoiling at the horror of people, individuals, who could do that. Newt was pontificating about the seething underbelly of the welfare society.

Newt has no heart. He has a brain and a weenie. And the weenie obviously overrules the brain more often than it should.

At least that's how he comes across often, and that's baggage.

I'm not his wife, and I'm not looking to date him, so I really don't consider his marital relationships, past or present, to be any of my business. And I really don't think now is the time to be quibbling about trivial bullshit. Our nation is in trouble, and to be blunt, I think anyone who's worried about "he's not a very nice or likable guy" at a time like this deserves to have their nation fall apart around them.

Now, show me evidence that Mr. Gingrich violated the law, a la former President Horndog, and we'll talk.

You're pointing at the marital infidelity side of the equation and poopooing us holding that against him. Republicans don't get to poopoo that. We've let the religious right carry the torch for us for so long that we are the preacher party. Democrats can cheat and not destroy their party. But if we cheat, we're hypocrites. You might not think it's fair or smart, but that's how it is. Newt burned his morality card and that's baggage.

But for me it's way more than the adultery. It's his hatefulness and lack of empathy. That's more than not being "likable". When a woman is murdered in a heinous way, you give condolences to her family. You don't start hurling around bullshit about the welfare state.

Back during the ground zero mosque upheaval he said something else which showed me that he hadn't learned his lesson, and which can be held against him in soundbites and on a deeper level. I don't remember the details and am not going to look it up at this time. I don't need to now because he's not a contender so I don't have to worry about him. Newt burnt his bridges with me long ago and I'm glad he's not a contender now.

What makes you think I'm a Republican?

Furthermore, please refer back to what I said earlier: if you're worried about his personality at a time like this, you deserve to have your country fall apart around you.

You asked about baggage. You don't get to define the terms about what should or should not be baggage and say "we'll talk" as if your terms make the baggage no more.

Baggage IS, whether you think it is logical or not. And Gingrich has it.

Yes, because there are a lot of shallow halfwits in this country who've been weaned on The National Inquirer and now don't seem to know how to differentiate between politicians and celebrities and set priorities when it comes to elections.

I don't get to tell you what inane bullshit you can or can't value over little things like issues, positions, and plans, but I sure as hell DO get to tell you that your "baggage" is a load of crap if that's what I think. And I do. So again, feel free to vote for the person who seems warm and fuzzy to you, but don't even consider coming in here and bitching about the problems in this country afterward. Your response is going to be, "But I'm sure he sends his condolences for your suffering, and that's all you cared about, isn't it?"

Myself, I'd rather have a coldhearted bastard who can fix our problems than a nice, likable person who sympathizes with them.

You asked about the baggage. I noted some of it. You can deny it all you want, but it exists.

Newt is not a viable candidate.

That's the bottom line.
