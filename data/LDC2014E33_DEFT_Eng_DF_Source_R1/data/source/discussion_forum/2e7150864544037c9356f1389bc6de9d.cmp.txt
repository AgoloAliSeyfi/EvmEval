@Montana,

I agree with most of what you said there, Montana, except that formula wouldn't result in "exceedingly rare."

I also don't believe there's a cure, but would be happy to be proven wrong. I refuse to believe, for instance, that a "normal person" could hack an innocent woman to death with a pick axe, for instance. I'll happily concede there are plenty of psychopaths out there capable of such deeds, who never do it, but normal people... no.

Those perps who's guilt-proof falls between "beyond a reasonable doubt" and death penalty-qualified-proof can serve as the lab-rats science seeks. One need not spare every rabid dog to study rabies.

@OCCOM BILL,

If the brain of a normal person malfunctions, they certainly can turn into someone who will hack someone up. For example, if someone has some kind of tumor growing in the brain in the area that controls our emotions and our ability to think like a normal person does, you're not the same person.
To be normal, you need a full functioning brain.

DNA is the most amazing thing to me and it facinates me on more than one level, so I believe that if science can find it's way into everyones own personal body design, they can do so much more.

I'm thinking the scientists will focus more on DNA and maybe find what makes people tick through that avenue.

Even if they wanted to use the dead bodies as lab rats, they can't do it without consent, so that's no help.

Anyway, science has come a long way.
