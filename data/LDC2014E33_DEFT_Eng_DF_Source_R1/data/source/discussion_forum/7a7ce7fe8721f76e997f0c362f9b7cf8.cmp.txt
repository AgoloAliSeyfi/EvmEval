There is nothing that can be posted that you would pay attention to unless it appeared to re-affirm your pre-maturely developed position. I've already posted evidence that you flat out ignore but demand more......

You have made a claim, that Japan offered to Surrender in 1945 NUMEROUS times before either bomb was dropped. PROVE it. The ONLY offer they ever made was through the Soviets and that was not a surrender it was a cease fire with a pullback to the 1941 Line for all sides. And according to this offer nothing else would be done to the Japanese.

After the first bomb was dropped they made an offer with 4 demands. We rejected it. After the second bomb and the Soviet Declaration of War and Invasion Japan's Emperor ordered an immediate surrender with no Conditions. The Allies accepted and changed the term to keeping the Emperor as a FIGURE head. Japan surrendered unconditionally.

This is rock solid proof you ignore facts you don't like because I've linked a government website showing japan offered a conditional surrender but you continue to ignore it.....like your twin Starkey.

Your website misinterprets the facts, thus the conclusion is wrong.

You would fail any paper you had to turn in on this subject with that interpretation. The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that you are intellectually anoxeric, refusing to ingest all the evidence. This is not being persuasive, but demagogic on your part.

Curve, the rest of America is not out of step, you are.

Straight up LIE. Before the bombs Japan wanted us to agree to a cease fire and a return to our 1941 start lines. They wanted no foreign presence in Japan, no Change of Government and no change of the Military. After the first bomb they still tried to make demands they want 4 things only one of which was the Emperor. After 2 bombs and a Soviet declaration of War they agreed to surrender and WE agreed to let them keep their Emperor as a FIGURE head only. The final surrender was UNCONDITIONAL. As evidenced by the Documents the Japanese signed.

You have yet to provide us with all the supposed surrender attempts by Japan in 1945. You keep making the claim but provide absolutely no evidence of such.

You are now engaged in the immorality of stubbornness. Your assertion has flatly been disproved. You can't admit it, which says very poorly about your character.

He cannot admit it, which only makes him pitiful.

You are a LIAR. I provided the minutes from the Japanese Government, I provided the Magic intercepts, they made a surrender offer ONLY after the first bomb. YOU have claimed they made numerous requests including JUST keeping the Emperor. PROVE your claim.

True. But like a bad dog which has shit on your rug, he CAN have his nose rubbed in it:

<quote>
We, acting by command of and on behalf of the Emperor of Japan, the Japanese Government and the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, hereby accept the provisions in the declaration issued by the heads of the Governments of the United States, China, and Great Britain 26 July 1945 at Potsdam, and subsequently to by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which four powers are hereafter referred to as the Allied Powers.

We hereby proclaim the unconditional surrender to the Allied Powers of the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters and of all Japanese Armed Forces and all Armed Forces under Japanese control wherever situated.

VJ day Honolulu. I don't think dead Japs were on their minds

65 Years Ago my Dad shot this film along Kalakaua Ave. in Waikiki capturing spontaneous celebrations that broke out upon first hearing news of the Japanese surrender. Kodachrome 16mm film: God Bless Kodachrome, right? I was able to find an outfit to do a much superior scan of this footage to what I had previously posted, so I re-did this film and replaced the older version There are still images from this amazing day, in color, at discoveringhawaii.com
