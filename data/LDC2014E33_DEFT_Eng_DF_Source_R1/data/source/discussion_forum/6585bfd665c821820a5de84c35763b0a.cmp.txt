Awe, The Peak Oil doomers are busted again by the August numbers. The chart below shows production capacity is outpacing actual production. We also have a glut of oil in storage. The price of oil is dropping even as the US Dollar weakens. THERE IS NO PEAK OIL.

Total World oil production capacity in July 2010 increased by 820,000 b/d from June 2010 from 90.16 to 90.98 million b/d. World production capacity is measured here as the sum of world liquids production excluding biofuels plus total OPEC spare capacity excluding Iraq, Venezuela and Nigeria.

With the big type, are you trying to compensate for your tiny argument? How bout providing an actual link, so that your latest round of drivel can be held accountable? Is that possible for you, or do you routinely pass off statistics and hope no one calls you on it around here.

In the meantime, "production capacity" right now doesn't mean squat for the course of the next 10 years. Do you even know what "production capacity" means? Probably not..... It's more a reference to existing infrastructure and known reserve capacity. Not future reserves. Where are the discoveries of new oil in any significance? Still waiting for you to provide that data. You won't, because you can't.

Meanwhile, here's the assessment of longterm production capacity by the Joint Chiefs:
“By 2012, surplus oil production capacity could entirely disappear, and as early as 2015, the shortfall in output could reach nearly 10 million barrels per day,” says the report, which has a foreword by a senior commander, General James N Mattis.
And here's how you link, to actually back up your assertions so they don't seem completely baseless:

<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/apr/11/peak-oil-production-supply">US military warns oil output may dip causing massive shortages by 2015 | Business | The Guardian</a>

As for the latest shale fan, who probably didn't actually read the thread, if you believe strip mining our own Rocky Mountains for a disgusting energy source that yields a 2:1 EROEI and honestly believe that will save us and get us off Middle Eastern imports, you really have no idea what you're talking about.

Do better.

Just as I thought. Now look at Chart 2 to the left, and notice what accounts for that total increase: Liquid fuels!!!!

In July 2010 world production of all liquid fuels increased by 860,000 b/d from June according to the latest fgures of the International Energy Agency (IEA). Resulting in total world liquid fuels production of 87.22 million b/d.

Definitions

Crude Oil, petroleum found in liquid and semi
liquid form including deepsea oil and
lease condensates.

Liquids, all forms of liquid fuels including
conventional, heavy, and extra heavy oil,
oil shale, oil sands, natural gas liquids, lease
condensates, gas-to-liquids, coal-to-liquids,
and biofuels.

In other words, light crude production continues to flatline or drop, while the difference (in order to meet ever-growing demand) is made up by ever dirtier, far-less efficient HEAVIER oil, like sands and shale. What's funny is that you think you've found something and are patting yourself on the back again, when in fact what you've provided actually SUPPORTS my thesis even further.

You're horrible at this.
