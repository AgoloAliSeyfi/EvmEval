How do you feel about anyone that wants you to fail?

How do you feel about terrorists who say Death to America?

Or how would you feel about a president who lied us into a war and got thousands of soldiers wounded and killed, or a radio host who was in on it? Seems the last time a soverign country was invaded like that was when Hitler invaded Poland for no reason.

And we don't hate Rush anymore than he hates us.

1. Obama's pastor said "God damn America". Obama continued to support him by attending his church and you still voted Obama.
2. PROVE Bush lied. Oh that's right, you can't.
3. It's an insult to those Hitler murdered that you compare Bush to him.
4. the last time a sovereign nation was invaded? Did you forget about Iraq invading Kuwait?
5. Did Rush say he wants Obama to fail or did the media twist it into him saying he wants America to fail?

1. Yes, God damn the racist America that owned slaves and did what it did to the indians.
2. Prove Bush lied us into Iraq? Oh yea, he got bad info. We all know he cherry picked. Are you only going to admit it if and after the dems launch a formal hearing or eric holder has an investigation? Because if we do, I god damn bet you a thousand dollars that you'll pull a 180 and start crying how we are wasting money on a partisan investigation. Fucking punks don't realize we know the games you fucking play.
3. Didn't one of you ask if we hate Rush as much as Jews hate Hitler? What a fucking hypocrite you are. And yes, I compare Bush to Hitler. Hitler created his own 9-11 like Bush let 9-11 happen so he could lie us into war. Read PNAC you dumb fuck?
5. Saddam had a reason to invade Kuwait, you just don't know what the reason is, you stupid brainwashed American who only gets Bush's side of the story.
6. Yes, we know you all want Obama to fail. And, we know that if Bush or McCain or Romney or Rudy were in charge, they'd be doing the same thing Obama is doing, only they would be pissing more money away on their buddies and Obama's spending is being spent in America.

but that's speculation so you'll say i'm wrong, but time and time again we've seen that you guys make everything political.

Hell, I've even seen Pelosi do this very same thing. When they weren't in power, they didn't like the Nuclear Option. Now that she's in power, she likes the nuclear option.

And the GOP was saying the same things we say about Bush when Clinton went into Kosovo. Only the GOP were wrong and we were right about Bush. Did you punish the GOP for being wrong on Kosovo? No you did not. Because you are a hack with a political agenda, just like the rest of us. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_shhh.gif"/>

Hmm... how many times have cartoons wished someone dead... I lost count. What about sitcoms... too many to bother counting. What about talk show hosts... at least half their jokes could be considered a "death wish" on someone. I am certain Rush has made jokes about it in the past (thus why he shut up about it). Thousands of songs about wishing someone dead... bah! Seriously... censorship at it's finest, that's all.

pretty dumb question if you ask me and you did,, what I want is a human in charge who can behave himself publicly with a little decorum... what he does in private is his own business. laughing outloud about "jokes" about the kidney failure and subsequent death of a talk show host everyone knows he and the left dislikes is not appropriate... it's the "politics of ridicule" it's disgusting.
