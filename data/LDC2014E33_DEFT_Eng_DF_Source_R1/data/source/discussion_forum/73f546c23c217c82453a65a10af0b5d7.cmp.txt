Good morning. Rasmussen is out this morning with a poll of how various prospective Republican candidates might fare against Obama. Scott starts out with a disclaimer, listing all the reasons why the poll is probably meaningless and then presents his results.
Romney 44% - Obama 42% (+2)
Huckabee 43% - Obama 43% (tie)
Palin 38% - Obama 49% (-11)
Gingrich 39% - Obama 47% (-8)
Paul 35% - Obama 44% (-9)
Other Repubs are further behind.

Obama, in the approval poll out today, is at -3 (48% - 51%). Ras suggests that an incumbent who polls in the 42% to 49% range is likely to face a very competitive reelection effort.
Obama won the popular vote in 2008 by a 53% to 46% margin. He carried the all important electoral college vote 365-173 (68% - 32%).
In responding to your question, Set, it would be useful perhaps to start with a map of the U.S. showing which states Obama and McCain carried.
Perhaps someone could post that.
Thanks for watching by the way. Several folks have told me privately that they are following this thread and are finding it informative but are not participating.

@georgeob1,

It would have to be a pretty special candidate, for the Republicans to capture a significant portion of Conservative Dems this cycle. I haven't seen that guy yet.

Do you not agree with the proposition that in order for the Republicans to have a strong success in the Senate, they need to have a strong candidate at the top of the ticket? I'd have to look the numbers up, but I seem to recall that the two tend to track each other pretty closely in Presidential election years.

@realjohnboy,

rjb, It's either scary or a good thing that Palin scores that high in the current polls; it means the GOP will be split enough to defeat their chances - or - Palin might be a threat to any democrat running.

@Cycloptichorn,

It depends on exactly what you mean with these somewhat imprecise terms. I don't believe that the Republicans require a Presidential victory to gain a 5-8 senate seats in the next election. Indeed I believe that outcome in the Senate is a near certainty in any projection based on current conditions, while, considering the Rasmussen poll RJB posted above, a Republican presidential victory doesn't yet look likely.

I guess you are also implying that a weak enough Republican Presidential candidate could deny Republicans even the success in the senate I noted above. While I'm willing to support the conjecture based on a self-referential term like "weak enough", I don't see it as a realistic possibility in the conditions at hand. Note that even in the "evil" Rasmussen poll RJB cited, Romney comes in about statistically even with Obama. Even applying the 5% bias you usually attribute to Rasmussen (something I don't believe is supported by the resultant facts where they are available) the poll indicates a close enough race to deny your proposition by any reasonable standard.

Guard against excessive demonization of the opposition. It often leads to underestimating them. Most people, even political figures, are complex creatures. Almost no one in the public eye is as good or bad as their supporters and opponents paint them to be.

@georgeob1,

I think the idea that the Republicans are going to gain 5-8 seats in the Senate in the next election is a stretch to begin with. Do you have specific seats in mind when you say this, or just sort of a nebulous idea of what you think SHOULD happen, based on the last election?

There are a lot of Dems up for re-election, but the majority of them are in very safe seats. And the Republicans have a few seats that they are going to have to fight very hard indeed to keep themselves.

You call the 5-8 seat outcome a 'near certainty.' I don't think that's anywhere near accurate. I'd love to see what actual data you look at that causes you to make statements like that, but I won't hold my breath.

Re: Rasmussen, you are simply incorrect. Educate yourself:

<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/rasmussen-polls-were-biased-and-inaccurate-quinnipiac-surveyusa-performed-strongly/">http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/rasmussen-polls-were-biased-and-inaccurate-quinnipiac-surveyusa-performed-strongly/</a>

Nate Silver goes into excruciating detail regarding the failings of the Ras model - and the self-selection bias that powers their strong Republican-leaning results.

Re: early candidate polling, it's useless and we all know it. It's impossible at this remove to have anything even remotely similar to the actual situation the country will find itself in in 18 months.

If you really think the Republicans are going to pick up that many seats in the Senate - tell us which ones they are. One would think that you would have an idea about that before making such a bold statement.

@Cycloptichorn,

Perhaps you missed my humble request, Cyclo. I would appreciate it if you could post a map of the electoral college results in 2008 between Obama and McCain.
Thanks.
