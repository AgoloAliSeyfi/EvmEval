That brings up an interesting question, shewolf. Is it easier to quit 'cold turkey' or by cutting back? Probably depends on the person but I was in the turkey camp.

I was too.

Because, I am an 'extreme' personallity style cold turkey was right up my alley

Either way, it takes a bit of resolve to stay there.
AS I have not..

I think.. and just M-O-, tappering off gives you room to make excuses to keep lighting up.

The all so typical - Im only smoking 2 a day now, that isnt dangerous-

or.. - I just need to taper off a few more weeks to ensure I wont start again-

i say, just do it. Dont prolong the withdrawls. Just do it.

but thats me

An ex boss would quit smoking occasionally but what she did was quit buying. She'd bum from me or someone else until she'd eventually cave in and buy some more for herself.

I was a regular smoker for many, many years but quit when I became pregnant for the first time. I was never a heavy smoker but I smoked every day, mostly in the evening after work.

My two sisters have one clear breath in the morning when they first wake up. There's nicotine in every subsequent breath.

Pregnancy was what stopped me for almost 2 years.
a funeral gave me excuse to start again.

I am honestly not looking to quit now.
I have always been a 3 cig a day smoker.
More, only if I have a beer to go with it.

but 10+ years of smoking and I have never EVER gotten worse.

I give.. im a smoker for life right now. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"/>

I'm the same way but it's more like three packs a year. My first response to major stress is to want a cigarette. Every so often I'll buy a pack, smoke one or two cigarettes to feel better and then stick the pack in a cupboard. I'll finish the pack over the course of a month or two and then not smoke again until I buy the next pack a few months later.

Smoking a two month old cigarette isn't very rewarding, I'm just too cheap to throw them away.

I really tried to quit for a decade. I'd quit for a week, a month, a few days... I finally got a Rx for Wellbutrin, and I haven't smoked for a year and seven months. &lt;well, I puffed about eight or none cigs since then, but none in the last year.&gt;

I swear, I feel so much better. All over. I visualize pink lungs. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"/>

Maybe some helpful aids, flushd? Quitting will be so good for you.

flushd....there's good news and bad news....

If you stay quit, the urges will become less and less. You've probably heard this before, but it really is like riding a wave. It will be like your floating along fine, then in an instant, you are caught up in this huge swell of the urge to smoke. I can't remember how long exactly, but the strong part only lasts a few minutes, like less than 5. If you can get past that a few times, you've put some notches in your belt. At first the waves come often, then, they fewer and fewer, and less and less strong, while at the same time your feeling of accomplishment gets stronger and stronger.

Can you ask your friend not to smoke around you? If she's a good friend, she'll take it outside.

The bad (well not so bad) news is, once you've successfully quit, all of a sudden, even years later, you'll get this sudden nostalgic urge. For me, it would be situational, I'd be in a great mood, doing something enjoyable, and I'll see or smell someone smoking and my brain will say "Remember how good a cigarette was when you used to do this"

However, when that happens, I'm able to laugh and myself and shake it off. It is just a momentary thing, like a minute, and you realize how yucky the cigarette would actually be.it's sorta like suddenly remembering an old lover.it's fun to think of him for a minute, but you're not going to go on a quest to find him.

BTW - the Wellbutrin is an excellent idea....talk to your dr. about it, it really does work.
