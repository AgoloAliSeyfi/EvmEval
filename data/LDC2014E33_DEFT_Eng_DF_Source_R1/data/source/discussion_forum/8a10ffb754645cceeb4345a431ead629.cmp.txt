Hugs.
From some of your post - I think you're better off without him...I know it may not seem like it when you have no where to go -but he seems like a real ass.

I know you were talking about your family wanted to you baptize Bella - is your family around?! Someone you could stay with for a while - so you can get your life together.

If you need someone to talk too - Im here just pm me. You're in my thoughts and I'll be praying for you and Bella.

I will keep you in my thoughts hunny. Im so sorry!!

I was kid of wondering how he can just kick you out. Did yall sign a lease together? He cant make you leave if you did. You dont have to sleep in the same room and you dont even have to talk.

What kind of man sends his child and his child's mother out to the streets with nothing?!! <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/frown.gif"/>

Please let us know how you make out hunny!!!

There are places for you to go though!! Im sure if you go to a local church, they can help get you put up somewhere until you can get on your feet!! <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/wink.gif"/> Whether its a shelter or with a church member, they are really about helping out people in need!! My parents had to do that when I was little!

Yur in my prayers hunny...

I'm so sorry sweetie....I know you are scared, and I would be too in your situation. Just remember, there is ALWAYS a way to make things work, ALWAYS. I have read posts about your boyfriend before, and you know what? He is an abuser. I don't know if he is physically abusive, but he is very mentally abusive on you. He wants you to think that you have no other option, and I can almost guarantee he will be begging for you to come back. It may be harder for a while, but, please please please break yourself free from this cycle! He knows he has leverage over you, because he pays the bills, and he makes you feel like living with him is your only option. It's not baby! You and Bella deserve a much better life than that! I am sure this situation is much more common than talked about, therefore, I am sure there are plenty of options for help in a crisis situation. Dont look back! You can do it! And, everything will work out just fine in time, as long as you have hope and faith!

I'm so sorry. <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/frown.gif"/> I think the other ladies gave some good advice. Where do you live - what state/city? My best thought is to try to find a good friend, family member or anybody you really trust that would take you in - even if it hurts your pride. Please don't be ashamed to ask for help if you have those options. This isn't your fault and you deserve a good home. Every one of us needs a helping hand sometimes. I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers.
