The truth is, now that Ohio went to Mitt the race is all but over. The problem is that all of the candidates are flailing around like a chicken with their head cut off. Too stupid to know they're dead, but determined anyways to do as much damage as they can on the way out. IF IF IF the nomination process ended tomorrow, Mitt might stand a fairly good shot at beating Obama. But the longer this goes on, the worse his odds get.

You think you could polish obama's ass with your pompoms any harder while you lick his boots?

There is NO WAY IN HELL the kenyan will win reelection, no matter WHAT happens during the republican primaries.

obama will lose in a land slide.

Eh. I don't think he deserves to win. I'm planning on voting for Mitt in the General.

The problem is that everyone is so concerned with winning the nomination, they're poisoning the well in the general. When you have a vicious hard fought primary in battleground states like Ohio and Florida, you have a lot of work to do to win back your own divided base and the Moderates who just watched you sling mud with sickening precision.

Now, if the nomination process ended soon, Mitt could start repairing the damage he's done to himself in this process. But the race keeps going, keeps traveling to battleground states where he keeps damaging himself just to win.

The general isn't a lock for Obama, but if you're thinking it'll be an easy win for the GOP you're quite frankly insane. Obama is going to fight hard, his proxies are going to fight hard, and right now the GOP Nomination process is doing their work for free. The longer this goes on, the more likely an Obama victory will be.

I totally disagree with your thoughts on all levels. I don't believe any damage at all is being done the republican candidates. I think this election cycle is making them tough and ready, and nothing I've seen or heard is making me dislike any one of them. I'll back which ever one wins. The only people that are parroting this "the republicans are hurting themselves" bull shit is the LIBERALS, so I think you're either gullible or here spreading crap.

You're free to have your own opinion on it. One thing you can't deny is that this process is flat out wasting money that should be spent in the General. Citizens means that Obama is going to have huge cash store in play and a pretty effective group of proxies.

Deny the damage done by the negative ads in the battleground states if you want, but even if none of that sticks come the General, the money spent is gone. Wasted targeting the other GOP candidates, and not Obama.

If Mitt wants to win, he desperately needs to get back on to attacking Obama and off of going after Santorum. But that isn't likely to happen as no one is dropping out.
