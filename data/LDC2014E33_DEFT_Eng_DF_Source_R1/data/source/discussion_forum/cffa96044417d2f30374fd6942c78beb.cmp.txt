Here comes Alveda. The "token" King.

Lots of non-white speakers at this event. Why would so many minorities show up and speak at an event like this if it was a discrace to MLK or if a bunch of "racist white people" were going to the rally?

It looks like reality and the anti-rally talking points are in conflict.

bodecca called her a "token" the other day. It was a jab at the asshole bodecca.

Sometimes it amazes me how easily lies roll off your tongue. Go ahead and show the post where I....I said she WAS a token....

Go right ahead. Amuse us.

Cause.....they were invited?

How many non-whites in the audience. I was looking and looking and looking and looking.

BTW, I enjoyed the singing of the National Anthem. Did you know that it used to be considered disrepectful to sing it in that manner? Marvin Gaye caught a lot of grief for going off the standard version in the 60s.

the american left support government tyranny and limited freedom. When Beck talks about restoring honor is talking about restoring the honor of our founding principles like faith, hope, and charity.

Obama and the left spouse a new system, an un-american system of government control and tyranny.

That is the honor. If you don't like it? Keep acting like fools. We liberty loving folk love laughing at you.

On a side note, it is not a party thing. Bush sucked almost just as bad as Obama when it came to securing liberty and founding principle. We need a man like Ron Paul, Paul Ryan, or Chris Cristie to set us on the right course.

We lost faith, hope and charity? Are they in the closet? Under the bed? In our bank safe deposit boxes?

Glen Beck is no George Wasington.

</quote>

ok. so can you answer the question please?

</quote>

No, I would not call George Washington a fascist.

Now answer my question. If honor needs to be restored, if must have been taken. How can honor be taken, and, if it was taken, who took it?

</quote>

What are you talking about?
Honor is not something that can be taken, rather it is something voluntarily ignored...honor is something we are inherently born with. We can choose to live by it..or not.
Clearly far too many people have forgotten not just honor, but integrity and the wisdom and care that what you do affects others, and what they do - affects you.

Dr. Glenn Beck? Oh PUUUUULLLEEEEZZZZ!!!!!!!!

Beck needs a doctor!(shrink)

His "faith" recipient just addressed Beck as "Dr." Beck. What a crock of steaming liquid shit!

Gotta change the chanel...these people are just too painfully ignorant.

more loons attacking the person and not the message. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/clap2.gif"/>

</quote>

Sit on it and spin sweet cheeks! Both Beck AND his message are crap!

I tuned in to give ol Glenn a chance. I made it to the "awards" part. Glenn is a self engrandising piece of shit and his followers of his "message" are morons.

I think you mean "aggrandizing".
