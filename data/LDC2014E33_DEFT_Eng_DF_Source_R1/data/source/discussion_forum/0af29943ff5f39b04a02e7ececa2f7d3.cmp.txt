Are you honestly too stupid to understand that the amount of birth control pills a woman uses has no relationship whatsoever to the frequency of intercourse she has.

ARE YOU HONESTLY THAT STUPID, or are you simply padding your reputation as a USMB troll?

Can't you just admit that the cost of birth control pills doesn't come close to the money she claims she requires to support her sex addiction? Are you deliberately stupid, or just trying to obfuscate just this one time. If all she needs are birth control pills, that doesn't come CLOSE to the $1,000 she claims she needs? No one wants to deny her birth control and disease control for this woman is a public health matter (which is why so many clinics give out free condoms) she just has to either pay for it, or extend herself far enough to get it free like the street whores do.

I don't know how much they cost. I don't take them. She may have been on the high end, but then I read this:

<quote>
In reality, oral contraceptives or The Pill range between $35 and $250 for the initial provider visit and the cost of a monthly supply of pills ranges between $15 and $50 a month, which amounts to between $180 and $600 a year depending on womans medical coverage.

This means some women without insurance coverage for contraception may pay over $850 the first year of their prescription. Other forms of birth control are far more expensive. For instance, the cost for a monthly supply of birth control patches ranges from $15 to $80 dollars, or between $180 and $960 a year. Combined with the doctors visit, uninsured women could spend over $1,200 dollars in the first year.

I do think she said up to. For some, I've no doubt it cost that much. For others, less. Nonetheless, a prescription should be something that should be covered in the policy for which she contributes premiums.

She did say 'up to', and she also made no specific reference to either here own sex life or her own use of contraception,

so all the slurs were manufactured out of thin air.

You can just tell those who didn't listen to her testimony for themselves. It's pretty revealing how many only go by what their right wing pundits tell them.

He apologized?

Oh man..that must have been serious.

</quote>

If you want to call that an apology. I wouldn't.

According to her, she's a slut. He just put the right term to it. Are you saying she's not a slut, she's a liar?

</quote>

She never references her personal sex life.

Years ago, Rush Limbaugh used to end his Friday show by saying to his dittoheads,

don't bother to watch the news over the weekend, on Monday I'll tell you what the news was,

and what it means...
