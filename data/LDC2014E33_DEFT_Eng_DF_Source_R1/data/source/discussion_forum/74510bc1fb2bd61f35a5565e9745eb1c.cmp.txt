<quote orig_author="Jonathan Chance">
The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) is a group of conservative activist doctors who oppose the 2010 health care reform law, the "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act."[1] Members of the group also believe that President Obama may have hypnotized voters and that climate legislation is a threat to human health. Some of the group's former leaders were members of the John Birch Society. Mother Jones wrote of the group, "Yet despite the lab coats and the official-sounding name, the docs of the AAPS are hardly part of mainstream medical society. Think Glenn Beck with an MD."[2]

False leprosy claim
The Spring 2005 edition of the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons contained an article[4] by Madeleine Cosman, headlined "Illegal Aliens and American Medicine," claiming, "Suddenly, in the past three years America has more than 7,000 cases of leprosy," citing a 2003 article in the New York Times as a reference. Among news outlets repeating this claim were WorldNetDaily[5] and CNN anchor Lou Dobbs. In fact, the 7,000 number in the Times article was an apparent reference to all then-current cases of leprosy in the U.S.; according to the National Hansen's Disease Program of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, there have been just 431 reported cases of Hansen's disease (leprosy) over the "past three years."[6]

Political contributions
Donations to political candidates by the AAPS' political action committee in 2000 and 2004 skewed rightward, with donations given to candidates registered as Republican, Libertarian or with the Constitution Party.[7][8]

Positions on health issues
Mother Jones, discussing AAPS's journal (called the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons), writes,

<quote orig_author="Jonathan Chance">
The publication's archives present a kind of alternate-universe scientific world, in which abortion causes breast cancer and vaccines cause autism, but HIV does not cause AIDS. Cutting carbon emissions represents a grave threat to global health (because environmental regulation would make people poorer and, consequently, sicker)... The organization opposes some of the most accepted practices in health care, including mandatory vaccine regulations. Peer review, a long-standing hospital practice that helps doctors learn from and prevent errors, is viewed as the source of great injustice by AAPS, which fights attempts to micromanage doctors with such bureaucratic nuisances as medical evidence about what works and what doesn't. Computers, too, are an ominous threat. The organization has resisted the use of electronic medical recordsÂ—which, naturally, represents an attempt by the government to acquire masses of private information about American citizens. (AAPS' executive director claims to keep all her patient notes in longhand.)[9]

Doctors for Disaster Preparedness
The website for the group Doctors for Disaster Preparedness (DDP) is registered to Jeremy Snavely of AAPS. [10] DDP and AAPS also share the same mailing address, in Tucson, Arizona. [11] [12]

DDP is skeptical of climate change, as the title of their web page on the subject suggests: "Ozone hole, Global warming, and other Environmental Scares." [13]

The AAPS certainly seems nutty, but what specifically is Rand Pauls association with them? I'm a little wary of reports that Candidate X is "associated with" whatever nutty organization, as they often turn out to be fairly tenuous links.

Here is a <a href="http://motherjones.com/mojo/2010/08/sharron-angle-rand-paul-association-american-physicians-surgeons">Fox "news" clip</a> where Paul mentions his his association with the group. He is supporting their lawsuit against so-called "Obama care".

The same article mentions Sharon Angle as another AAPS supporter. She was <a href="http://www.aapsonline.org/">a guest speaker</a> for at least one of their events.
