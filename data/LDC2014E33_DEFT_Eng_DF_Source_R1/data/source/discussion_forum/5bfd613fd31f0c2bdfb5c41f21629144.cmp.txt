I didn't realize Bill Clinton was impeached for adultery? I thought it was because he lied to a grand jury and used his office to influence others to lie? Amazing what you can learn on the internet <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

Technically, you are right.

Practically, nobody cared.

Because every MAN in this country would have told the exact same lie if asked.

People forgave Clinton for the lying because the question never should have been asked in the first place.

Just like they thought the "hi-tech" lynching of Clarance Thomas was wrong 7 years earlier.

Interrogating people about their sex lives isnt' kosher to a lot of people.

Now, in the interest of complete fairness, Clinton brought most of his troubles down on himself. He should have settled with Paula Jones years earlier. And he got a whole lot of millage out of sexual harrassment BS at the time of the Thomas hearings.

But all the real damage was done when Lewinsky's name came out. By pressing the issue, the Republicans made themselves look bad.

I find it interesting that you probscribe your personal values to "practically" everybody. I would suggest that a few more than "nobody" cared. Using executive privelege to lure women into sexual relationships is at best, sleazy...At worst, corrupt. Maybe a few of the problems in this country are caused by people who give a pass to the sleazy and corrupt?

If a BJ was the biggest concern of the nation with the president right now-the whole country would be a lot better. I mean seriously Clinton was 100X better than W. Bush and Obama.

You're also VERY naive if you think any modern president isn't/wasn't corrupt. They all are/were on some level.

PS-Nice icon! \m/

Back to my boy, Newt. I LOVE hearing him talk in these debates. He makes the other candidates sound like a bunch of kids squabbling over the last Popsicle. Check out the way Newt discussed Herman Cain's 999 plan. He started by commending and complimenting Cain, and then raised objections to the plan without ONCE denigrating Cain, or even sounding like he was denigrating the plan. He sounds so statesmanlike.

I've been following his website postings about the legislation he would propose as President. It's really good, and quite innovative in places. And I like his plan for his first Executive Order as President to be abolishing all "czars" in the federal government.

You like intelligence and a President who speaks in full sentences? We agree.

But.....then you say you like the plan to abolish czars. Don't you know that this is just a piece of grandstanding nonsense?

</quote>

You like intelligence and good speaking? I hadn't noticed, given your election of Barack Oteleprompter.

What I know about abolishing the czars is that they're Unconstitutional and have no business having power in our federal government, and thus, I know that it's an excellent idea to return that power to the people duly elected or appointed in accordance with law.

But as I mentioned earlier, I realize that laws are just suggestions to be ignored at will to leftists, so I don't expect you to understand why they're so important to the rest of us.

By far the best debater and most informed candidate and could easily kick Obama's ass in a debate...

Turned Clinton from a deficit spending President in a fortunate economy to a budget surplus and Democrat pro-sexual harassment hero..

Soo.. what's your beef with this Guy...?

Newt Gingrich: 2012 Campaign Staff Exodus Makes Me 'Feel Liberated'
06/15/11

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said during an appearance on Fox News on Tuesday night that he feels "liberated" by the mass exodus of staffers from his presidential campaign.

Last week, news of aides jumping ship from the Gingrich 2012 political operation sent shockwaves across the political spectrum. Campaign manager Rob Johnson and spokesman Rick Tyler were just two of numerous members of the presidential candidate's team to resign.

When "the best debater" and "most informed candidate" can't even convince his own campaign manager and spokesman to stay with his campaign at this early date - then something is definitely wrong!

When a mass exodus of staffers makes a presidential candidate feel "liberated" - then someone is out of touch with reality and my money is on the Newt!

Huffington Post? Puhleeze. I would have explained what happened to you if you hadn't proven yourself to be a braindead twink who's incapable of finding the truth, let alone comprehending it.

Dismissed. Move along.
