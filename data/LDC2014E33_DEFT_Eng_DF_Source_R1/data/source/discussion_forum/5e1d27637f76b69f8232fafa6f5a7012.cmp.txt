i watched the clip of it, he didnt answer it. he whined about the media and how disgusting it was for them to ask such a question.

nice try..... Like i said its rather meaningless anyways. Newt is a hypocrite when it comes to marriage so his opinions on it are meaningless.

Hey folks...

HERE IT IS....

PLASMABALL THINKS IT IS OK TO DEBATE SOMETHING BASED ON A SNIPPET...A CLIP OF WHAT HIS MEDIA DEEMED WAS WORTHY OF HIS KNOWING.

I mean...you actually said he never answered the question.

That is completely false.....he answered it completely.

</quote>

We do it all the time here...I watched the whole clip of him not really answering it, and giving King shit for it.

If there was more, feel free to provide said evidence and we can go from thier.

He didnt answer the question, he just blasted King and the media ( which was his answer). Im not sure where you are going with this and how you are reading my " he didnt answer the question".

He answered it with a dodge.

</quote>

Yo...

he reacted to the question....and then he answered the question.

Yet the media that deemed it appropriate for the question to be asked did not feel the public warranted knowing his answer.

I willnot provide you a clip. I dont need to. You want to assume you are correct....go for it....live in your ignorance.

I love it.

The media is on Romney's side.... Newt stings them back.

Actually, the media is on Obama's side.

yes that is right -- which also compels them to favor Newt over romney. most Democrats in DC feel he will be one of the easiest opponents for obama to defeat in the general election. right or wrong they think of romney as more electable

My was not a diversion. Mine was a response to something someone had said that was inaccurate.

No one is saying the media does not report the facts equally.....they do.

But it is HOW they report them that makies it appear there is media bias.

With the GOP candidates...we hear the media say "Rommeys critics feel he has something to hide in regard to his tax returns"

With Obama....we heard..."It is not unusual for a candiate to not want to release his college transcripts...some do, some dont."

Why didnt they say "Obamas critrics feel he may have something to hide regarding his college transcripts...afterall...it is true..his critics felt that

</quote>

Oh SHIT! Well, shit, why didnt you present that evidence earlier.

"Why didnt they say..." isnt proof of anything other than you thought up a question they didnt answer. Why didnt they ask Bush what happened to the millions that was lost in Iraq? Bias or they didnt ask?

Because I can think of questions they asked Obama and not Bush but what the fuck does that mean? Nothing.

</quote>

hey..

They intervvciewed Newts X right before a primary.

Did they interview any of Obamas former class mates?
Did they interview any of Obamas parishoners at Wrights church?
Did they interview anyne part of the Resko company?

Heck...I got a question....who did they interview to dig up any dirt that may be out there about Obama?

Who from his past did they intertview?

</quote>

Hey,

They asked Obama about Bill Aires but never asked Bush about his relationship with the Bin Ladens...You know what that means...Yep, Media Bias.

We can do this all day but at the end of it all, it's just you laying out bullshit to claim you are the victim of the liberal media, liberal education, liberal historians, liberal scientists, liberal brainwashers, liberal washing machines that wont get that stain out etc.

It must be tough always being under attack...Thats when you let your conservadaddy hold you tight and tell you what a big bad world is out there and he'll protect you
