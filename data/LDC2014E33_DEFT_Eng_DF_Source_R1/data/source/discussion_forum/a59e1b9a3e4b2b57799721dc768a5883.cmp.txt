Why sorry?

I disagree, the fact that a woman could have avoided being raped does not make it her fault. Did you know for certain that these "hoodlums" would be there at the time brandishing their knives? I doubt it. How could a woman know that a rapist is in the vicinity? Should she just assume so because it is a dark and secluded place?

All attacks (all crimes, really) can be avoided simply by being in a different place at the time, that doesn't make it the victims' fault.

I know this wasn't directed at me but it makes no sense whatsoever. Plus, since when are all shortcuts inherently dodgy?

Care to explain why you disagree with my reply to your post?

The fact that you clearly didn't understand the point I was making makes you sound even more childish. I have never said that she was right not to take a taxi because the danger shouldn't have been there, as many people seem to have interpreted my comment. Holmes was saying that she should have taken a taxi home, but what use is that when she had already been raped?

We should be advising women on how to be safe at night, and that includes taking taxis when needed and perhaps making some forms of self defence legal, as some have suggested, rather than making examples of women who have been raped. We should also work towards changing peoples preconceptions about rape, work towards improving rape prosecution statistics and prison sentences among other things and we might be able to decrease the number of rape cases.

By fault, I didn't mean it as in 'her fault she got raped har har' - I mean, if one exercises caution, these things can be prevented.

It's not about the cost. The reason women are being raped is because they're powerless. If the government is ****ty enough to not be able to provide protection for them then they should be allowed weapons.

We aim to be living in a free country. No one needs to constantly be on their toes "plan in advance" like some people suggested or to avoid taking short cuts.

If you hear of a man getting brutally murdered and robbed in a dark alleyway you won't be busy blaming his lack of rational thinking and saying he should have taken a taxi because men are more able to protect themselves in physical situations. Since women are at a natural disadvantage, people naturally blame them more for not taking more precaution. The solution: cancel out the differences by providing women with a means to protect themselves in order for them to avoid the inconvenience of "thinking in advance".

Of course I don't think this is a necessity, but it's a partially silly solution in response to the ridiculously stupid statement some people here made about women being partially to blame for rape.

How can the government protect every female? it doesn't make them ****ty. If you can't answer this with an actual viable reason you're also ****ty.

Was this women carrying a rape alarm? do you carry a rape alarm? most likely the answer is no to both, so once again the weapon thing isn't a solution and would be very open to abuse.

Planning in advance and not taking short cuts is pretty sensible really...I do it all the time and I'm male.

The rest of what you wrote I agree with. But society isn't perfect, so avoiding danger is common sense. Rather than doing what you think is morally right for a perfect utopia you should probably do what is safest for you taking into account what society is like right now.
