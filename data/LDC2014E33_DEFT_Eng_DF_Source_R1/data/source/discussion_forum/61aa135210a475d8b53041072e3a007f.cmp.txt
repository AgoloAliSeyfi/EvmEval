You can't guarantee prosperity, some people have bad luck, or make unwise decisions that don't work out. It's the way it's been since the beginning of time.

But if you work hard and do right, you will have a much better chance of being prosperous than you will by sticking your hand out to uncle Sam.

I do feel we should look after those who truly need it. That does not include chronic baby factories, or healthy individuals whose only ailment is lack of motivation.

I totally agree.. However our politicians who allegedly represent us use tax dollars to buy votes - more specifically progressive politicians...

Of course republicans have their own dirty too, however I recognize the difference between a RHINO and a real republican, libertarian or whatnot..

I have absolutely no problem with our government helping the truly needy, however using tax dollars to entice a specific base to vote for you is wrong.

If you're 25 years old you should be working, you shouldn't have to depend on welfare to get you through life, however democrats have no problem handing money out to perfectly healthy 25-year-olds with 15 kids just as long as they vote democrat and of course if that 25-year-old wants to keep her benefits she better vote democrat..

Our government is just dysfunctional...

Or maybe your just dysfunctional. Its easy to label all that shit as liberal/progressive but its corporate liberalism that got us here. Unfunded prescription drug program, unfunded tax cuts, bailouts, no bid contracts, all happened under the Bush regime.

Dont expect a response to your reply. We have been through this enough to know for a verifiable fact that your a dumbfuck. I just wanted to pop in and remind you of that today. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

I love how bitches with 4th grade educations are shitting kids and look to our government to support them..

Of course in your LITTLE WORLD only the needy get fed...

In my world there is epic welfare fraud, and I have seen it..

Yeah minorities are proud to have 10 kids they can't support and they will CONTINUE to vote for Obama because activist organizations give them a free tote bag if they do..

Not only do they get free shit they're escorted to vote for the fucking democrats and told who to vote for...

The old saying is: "a grand jury would 'indict a ham sandwich,' if that's what you wanted."

You could buy a democrat vote with a ham sandwich....
