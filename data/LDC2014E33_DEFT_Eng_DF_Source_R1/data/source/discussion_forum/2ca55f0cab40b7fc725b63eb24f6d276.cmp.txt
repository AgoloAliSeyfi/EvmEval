Due Process begins with proper police procedure, you stupe. As it's evident, the cops in that area didn't even do that! A matter of history, a matter of fact that...which now requires scrutiny by other forces (state and possibly federal).

But do continue to babble like a good little neocon/teabagger/libertarian flunkie....it would be funny if it weren't so pathetic. Carry on.

Thanks for proving my point, Pauly. Have the last word, if it makes you feel better. You're dismissed!

Ok. You're also an angry bigot. See ya. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

Aw, Liberal cretins are just pissed because Zimmerman is actually Hispanic. It kinda throws a wrench in their 'Evil Whitey kills Black Kid' Race-Baiting hysteria. Liberal Media Outlets like CNN &amp; NBC are absolutely befuddled as to how to proceed. First they called him 'White' and indicted the entire White Race. But now they're backpedaling and have become distraught. The Liberal Media is a joke. Period, end of story.

Pauly is STILL babbling in his ignorance regarding the true origin and definition of the word "hispanic".

Zimmerman's own history of calls to the cops and the following set his mindset regarding racial prejudice

The "fight" was a result of Zimmerman PURPOSEFULLY CONFRONTING MARTIN WITH HIS PREJUDICE IDEALS....IDEALS RECORDED ON THE 911 TAPE.

WTF are YOU babbling about?

Why do you hate America so much?

Are you just being a stupid crank with this neocon/teabagger BS? Or are you truly just another libertarian lunkhead parroting your neocon/teabagger cousin's stupidity?

In America we have a thing called Due Process. We do not approve of Lynch-Mobs. I know that bothers you Socialists/Progressives, but that's the way it is. So get over it.

Hey genius, "due process" includes PROPER POLICE PROCEDURE....that means you DO NOT just let a man involved in a fatal shooting go scott free without so much as taking them to a precinct for questioning, drug/alcohol test. The call for justice is a call for Zimmerman to be arrested, not "lynched".

Intellectually dishonest libertarians/neocons/teabaggers are quick to distort and misrepresent anything that does not fit into your warped version of life....but the FACTS will always be your undoing. Carry on.

My brother, I implore you, do not engage with circus barkers...for you just stoop to their deplorable level. They are to be laughed at or pitied from afar, but certainly not fed.
