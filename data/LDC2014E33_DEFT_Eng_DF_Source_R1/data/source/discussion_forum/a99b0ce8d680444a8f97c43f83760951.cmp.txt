Hence ADG will reveal exactly this, simply because ADG reflects the competition to contract space between 2 bodies.
Exactly like when 2 person compete to eat the same piece of spaghetti.

Ok, so the gravitational forces are zero, but ADG isn't? (since ADG is a measure of the contraction of space, after all)

Now explain to me how something can accelerate without a force, in your theory.

I have promised to come back when the measurement result of the DOMUS VISTA Project was done. - Here we are.

INTRODUCTION
It should be possible to measure whether our understanding of CENTRAL gravity is correct.

Even though the prevailing understanding is build on Human logic, and sounds as rational thinking, we can't be sure that this reflect the "logic" of nature / space.
I mean how logical was it 100 years ago that space deforms. (?)

If matter consumes space and hence bends space toward matter, - space must "stretch" towards an object. Hence we are talking about the exact same property of space responsible for the expansion of the Universe. This would have huge consequences. For example "dark matter" would be nothing but naturally central gravity.

Our "logic" tell us that; Acceleration Due to Gravity (ADG) must be a result of how much mass there is under the measurement point. This could be wrong.

The way gravity (ADG) works could be completely different, and rather illogical. Space could very well continue to stretch the whole way towards the centre of a body. The reason could be that central space is trapped by encircled "space-consuming" matter.

To know which of these theories that is correct, it is necessary to measure CENTRAL gravity and compare the result from result below and above the central area.

There idea was systematically to measure a buildings gravity above and below the gravity centre, (see the red line in the image) and that's why Denmark's biggest resistance building originally was the target.

But the problem was that the only place where identical systematically measurement was possible (in that building) was in the southern end of the building, at the staircase. ( see the green line ).

<a href="http://www.science27.com/english/Measurement/Space.jpg">http://www.science27.com/english/Measurement/Space.jpg</a>

To easy understand the buildings own gravity, try to imaging the building was floating in space.

Measurement on the one side of the building (maximum 5 meter inside) is off course only superficial.

Such can compared with gravity measurement near the surface of Earth.

In other words these measurements can't be used to confirm any of the theories.

However these systematically measurement was executed, - and was useful to learn from, to prepare for the final project.

The result of the measurement can be seen <a href="http://www.science27.com/english/Measurement/Domus.pdf">here</a>

The Final Project
Experience shows that that building can't be used to confirm the new theory.

Data are too inaccurate. It's too much noise and too many unknown factors that play a role, and the building is simply to light, compared to the gravitational noise etc.

A heavy / solid homogeneous and well define object must be the target instead.

<a href="http://www.science27.com/english/Measurement/Container.jpg">http://www.science27.com/english/Mea.../Container.jpg</a>

The next project is to build a container that measure 5 meter in diameter and 5 meter height. This should be enough to confirm which theory is the right one.

(Pi * 2.5 * 2.5 * 5) = 98.125 M3 approximated 98125 KG

The containers own gravity should hence be - MG/r^2 &gt;&gt; 98125 KG * 6,67E-11 / 2.5^2 = 104 mGal

This should be enough to show that the containers own CENTRAL gravity not is zero.

Measurement can be done as follows;
1.) Below the container (central) from a tunnel.
2.) Right below the centre and above the centre (in a tunnel)
3.) From 2 places of the side
4.) On the top (central) of the container.

My opinion is that science must if possible be built on objective observation and measurement, not on believe also not on "Human Logic".

In this case it is easy to prove.
It is unacceptable that is today still not is done.

Any support &amp; suggestions are welcome.

I have plotted your readings into a graph. Even if the gravity of the building is close to the noise floor, your thesis predicts a distinct jump in gravity when the center of gravity is passed. That did not happen. Similar measuremetns have been made before, on more massive buildings. Those series also confirmed the conventional theory.

Bjarne, you did actually go through the experiment, and you have my respect for that. Now try to keep it by admitting that your thesis failed.
