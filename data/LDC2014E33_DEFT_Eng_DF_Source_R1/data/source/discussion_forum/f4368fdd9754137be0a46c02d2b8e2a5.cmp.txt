While they need help, far too many do not want it enough to make the life changes necessary.

</quote>

Want has very little to do with addiction. If you understood how the addicted brain works you'd know that.

<quote>
And most people do not expect that smoking cigarettes will give them lung cancer or some other respiratory disorder. Both are "risk taking behaviors" shared by gamblers and skydivers. You have removed personal responsibility from the equation.
</quote>

No I have not, part of treatment for almost any disease involves the patient undertaking certain behaviors to aid in their recovery.

<quote>
"Just say no" is directed toward those who have never imbibed and are not addicts. It combats the likelihood of addiction if you chose to use addicting drugs.
You started this so don't claim foul now - Bullshit. You need to check your facts. There are 2 types of Diabetes mellitus. (actually there are three types of diabetes but only two are because of insulin - Diabetes refers to the excessive production of urine which is a symptom. Diabetes incipitus is the third type) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1">One</a> is the result of the lack of production of insulin and the other is best described as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes">retarded production of insulin</a>. In either case the condition is aggravated by poor diet (diet is not the cause) and is treated with that which is lacking or the balance of available resources is restored. Have you ever heard of gestational diabetes mellitus?
</quote>

While diabetes is not contagious, it has the same route- underlying genetic issue triggered by behavior.

<quote>
Another Bullshit alert. Those are called pathogens. Do you know what those are? That fits the disease model. What is the "bug" in the medical model that many are deluded into believing in addictions like AGW.
</quote>

What is the bug in many diseases with a genetic vs viral or bacterial cause?

<quote>
Wrong again. Addicts are screwed up in the head but you posit it as something they catch. Much like inmates who state, "I caught a new a case," as their reason for returning to prison. There was not a disease or a case out there floating around with their name on it, they did something to be addicted or be charged. The problem with disease model is that it removes the responsibility from the addict and places it on an outside factor - stress. Poor coping skills is a behavioral problem. It is the model that is the problem.
</quote>

Your assuming drug taking is poor coping skills. But the evidence shows that the drug taking urges are centered in the mid brain which is not ruled by logic like the higher brain. Its part of the basic survival mechanism.

<quote>
The addict has to make a real effort to examine the addiction cycle and avoid the events that lead to relapse -- people with whom he or she participated in substance abuse, places in which it is available, and things that lead them toward the behavior.
</quote>

And the heart disease patient, diabetes patient, cancer surviver etc all have to make those same types of introspection, self examination and life style changes.

<quote>
They did not become addicts the first time they used. You do not become allergic to something the first time you are exposed either. The body has to first develop an antibody to the antigen or the "bug." There must be multiple exposures for addiction to occur and the change in brain function to occur.
</quote>

The genetic evidence suggests they did.

<quote>
Yet another -- You mean DISORDER; the DSM is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Do you see the word "disease" in the title? Again, the disease model is used for treatment because of "treatment" considerations.

Treatment is funded through insurance companies which require a ICD (International Classification of Diseases ) code. Treatment is supervised by Medical Doctors whose specialty is Psychiatry. Nurses are involved in the treatment regime as are counselors in the medical model.
</quote>

Your parsing words, the NIH, AMA and APA all classify addiction as a brain disease.

<quote>
When you move to the self help movement, NA/AA you find folks who have none of these fancy degrees, titles, and need for funding. Guess what. The program works because responsibility is part of the program.
</quote>

Responsibility is part of the treatment regime for almost every disease.

<quote>
Do you? "The mission of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is to lead the Nation bringing the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction." Sounds like they have an agenda.
</quote>

They are part of the NIH a part of the US government, and are joined by the AMA and APA.

<quote>
Features is not disease.

I rest my case.
</quote>

As a trained expert in psychology you know what belief perseverance is, I suggest you check yourself for it.

<quote>
With regard to the imaging studies, they are after the onset of addiction.
</quote>

Not all of them.

<quote>
People do not use drugs because of the down side but because they feel better when they use them. But they sure get ensnared by the down side. Prevention is far more effective that trying to get the genie back in the bottle.
</quote>

Prevention is more effective than trying to get the genie back in the bottle- based on what evidence? The war on drugs has failed.

Prevention as in education and regulation or stopping the substance of the addiction?
