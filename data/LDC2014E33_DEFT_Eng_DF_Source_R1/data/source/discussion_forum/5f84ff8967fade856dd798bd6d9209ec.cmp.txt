Is it just me or does Tony Blair, amidst all this strife and turmoil, look ever more like Prince Charles?

This one from Daniel Finkelstein in the Time's brilliantly funny:

<quote>
<a href="http://timesonline.typepad.com/comment/2006/09/splits_resignat.html">It all sounds familiar</a>

Splits, resignations, media frenzy, calls for a new leader. It all sounds incredibly familiar to someone who has worked for John Major and William Hague. So I thought my Blairite friends in Downing Street and elsewhere might enjoy the benefit of my experience:

1. You will be tempted to call for unity. Calls for unity never work.

2. You are quite right, you are surrounded by nutters. But the funny thing about nutters is that they don't appreciate being called mad. Don't bother, therefore, attacking your internal opponents.

3. You were quite wrong. Things can't only get better.

4. Every cunning plan you dream up for diverting the news agenda will fail. Don't think that getting Margaret Beckett to make a speech on CAP reform will move your splits down the news.

5. There is nothing you can do. Nothing. And therefore the best thing you can do is.....

6. Nothing. The only card the Prime Minister still has is incumbency. He should keep his head down, keep his mouth shut, and keep going. This will fail to work, but do so less spectacularly than anything else. Oh and.....

7. Don't write anything down.

<quote orig_author="Steve 41oo">
A number of MPs and junior ministers have signed a letter calling for Blair to go now, but Blair has not sacked them. Now one of them Tom Watson, has "resigned".
</quote>

Hmm, hmm.. the quotation marks around the "resigned" are correct..

In his own resignation letter, Watson explains how it happened:

<quote orig_author="Tom Watson">
As you know, I had a conversation with the chief whip last night, in which she asked me to withdraw my support from the 2001 intake's letter calling on you to stand down, or my position would be untenable as a government minister.

I have reflected on this overnight. I cannot withdraw my name, and therefore I accept her judgement.
</quote>

<a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,1866017,00.html">Full text of Tom Watson's letter</a>

His letter is admirably plainspoken, at least relative to the standards of this Blairite age, by the way.

The impression you get is of someone who truly believed in the Labour Party-make 2; that is, one of that rare breed of New Labourites-by-conviction. The sheer naivity he expresses in his dreamlike impressions of how

<quote orig_author="Tom Watson">
"We have revolutionised the lives and expectations of millions of our citizens, combining social justice with prosperity in a way which is unprecedented in the history of our country"
</quote>

(take that, Clement Attlee), is daft to the point of being kind of endearing. You certainly have to feel for a life so well wasted when he points out that

<quote orig_author="Tom Watson">
The Labour party has been my life since I was 15 years old. [..] The struggle to fashion the kind of credible, convincing, effective Labour party you now lead has been the preoccupation of my adult years.
</quote>

Yet when addressing the PM he is surprisingly straightforward:

<quote orig_author="Tom Watson">
So it is with the greatest sadness that I have to say that I no longer believe that your remaining in office is in the interest of either the party or the country.

How and why this situation has arisen no longer matters.

I share the view of the overwhelming majority of the party and the country that the only way the party and the government can renew itself in office is urgently to renew its leadership.
</quote>

His letter, moreover, refrains from most any dig, which speaks for Watson though it reduces its entertainment value. There's just the one, which obliquely but snidely refers to Blair's well-known obsession with his (personal) "legacy":

<quote orig_author="Tom Watson">
For the sake of the legacy you have long said is the only one that matters - a renewed Labour party re-elected at the next general election - I urge you to reconsider your determination to remain in office.
