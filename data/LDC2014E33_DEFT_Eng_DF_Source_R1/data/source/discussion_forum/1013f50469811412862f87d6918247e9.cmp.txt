Saying that people in the US aren't concerned with global warming and are selfish is just dumb. You can't make that conclusion based on what 4 or 5 people out of the whole entire country say. <img src="http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/doh.gif"/>

Perhaps you should realize that the main problem is it sounds like you are attacking Americans and blaming the entire problem of global warming on us and that we are the ones responsible for fixing it. That makes people defensive and not want to hear anything you have to say. Whether you meant it that way or not I don't know, but that's the way it came across to me.

Now to address your question on what we plan to do is simple; we as individuals cannot do much. out geographic and urbanization settings are set up much different than more of Europe. Other than a few large cities like NYC, Atlanta, San Francisco and so on, most of Americans live in cities that are spread out. Because of this, you cannot get to your job or the grocery store or to school or anywhere besides your backyard without a car. I want to eat so I need to have a car to drive me around. That simple. A bus system would help cut down on the cars, but again in the smaller, spread out towns it would end up being worse because there aren't enough people to ride them to each destination.

Before I can do anything to cut down car pollution companies need to 1. produce many many more hybrids or other fuel efficient cars at a price that the majority of Americans can afford. or 2. find a fuel alternative to gasoline that is about the same price and then make it available at all locations and start only producing cars that run off that.

There are lightbulbs that cut down the use of electricity, but they are $10 a bulb. Quite a bit higher than the 75 cent ones.

I know most of the world thinks Americans are insanely rich and have money to spend on anything and everything, but the fact is that American money is not evenly divided. Most middle class people live paycheck to paycheck and cannot go out and buy a new car that is fuel efficient or insert solar panneling on their homes to use that as their energy source.

Perhaps the better question here is what are all of the multimillion and billionaires in the ENTIRE WORLD going to do about global warming? What are scientists who are educated in how to treat and prevent the problem going to do? What are television and news anchors who help spread the word and educate others about the problem going to do? What are government officals going to do to make sure that everyone does their part in this. Until everyone is properly educated in the problem and what they as individuals can do while staying in their budget, we can't really do much.

I totally agree! This isn't just an American problem, this is the worlds problem. Each country should do what it can to help solve the problem of global warming. To say that it's all America's fault is not correct. Yes, America does not do all that it can to relieve global warming, but then who does? The leaders of the world need to get together and begin constructing a massive plan to stop global warming. In every industry, with every resource, all the professionals and experts on the matter should be called in and lets SOLVE this problem. We don't need to be caught pointing fingers when this problem eventually blows up into our faces. Let's go with a worldwide plan to STOP this before it's too late!

Looks like Pat Robertson is now concerned about global warming, and taking it seriously.

Heat converts Bush ally Robertson on global warming

By Timothy Gardner

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Conservative Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson said on Thursday the wave of scorching temperatures across the United States had converted him into a believer in global warming.

The view put him at odds with fellow Republican President George W. Bush, who has benefited politically from Robertson's backing and who has refused to embrace the concept of human-caused global warming.
"We really need to address the burning of fossil fuels," Robertson said on his "700 Club" broadcast. "It is getting hotter, and the icecaps are melting and there is a buildup of carbon dioxide in the air."

It was an abrupt about-face for Robertson who reaches about one million U.S. viewers daily and is credited for helping shape political views of evangelical Christians, a vibrant force behind the Republican Party.

Last October, Robertson said the National Association of Evangelicals was teaming up with "far left environmentalists" for saying global warming was caused by humans and needed to be mitigated.
Also last year, Robertson, 76, said natural disasters affecting the globe, including hurricanes Katrina and Rita that wrecked the U.S. Gulf Coast, might be signs that the biblical apocalypse was nearing.

Temperatures have soared to near record levels in some eastern regions and Robertson said that was "the most convincing evidence I've seen on global warming in a long time."

Most scientists link greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide emitted from the burning of fossil fuels to global warming that could lead to heat waves, stronger storms and flooding from rising sea levels.

Bush, himself an evangelical Christian, pulled out of the international Kyoto Protocol setting limits on emissions causing global warming soon after taking office in 2001 saying it would hurt the economy and unfairly favored developing countries.
