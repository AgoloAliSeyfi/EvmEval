Well, actually, he does. She stopped being a "private citizen" the minute she got up in front of Congress and testified and took a political stand. Then she became a "political activist", which is pretty much stepping up into the dunk-tank of public opinion.

Not saying this is "right" or even "good". In fact, I suspect a lot of people who would make good leaders stray away from politics because of EXACTLY this sort of thing.

But it's part and parcel of our system. Even back to the oldie days when they talked about Thomas Jefferson's mistress or slandered Andrew Jackson's wife.

(Of course, Andrew liked to challenge people to duels. Maybe we need to bring that back!)

I think not. There's a long standing position that political speech, no matter how vile, is protected under the first amendment, as it should be.

Otherwise we'd all be in trouble.

Political speech is. Slander isn't.

Looks like the Left is just pissy because they can't beat this dead horse anymore. The man apologized. And that's more than hateful Left nutters ever do. It's over. Time to move on.

Did you let Monica Lewinsky go? He's the spokesperson of the GOP. We are in an election year. Imagine the thousands of undecided or new voters that Rush has pushed over to our side???

Wait a minute. Clearly by your comment you were in favor of cutting funding to Planned Parenthood, and now you want to use it as a source women can use to get free birth control?

Are you sure Planned Parenthood still exists after all the cuts/changes the GOP made during the Debt Ceiling fiasco?

Now listen and listen good. Free market For Profit PRIVATE insurance companies did a cost analysis on birth control and decided it would save them money if they provide contraception as preventative medicine. Much cheeper than paying for a child birth.

So you aren't paying for it. Its saving you money. Stop paying for contraceptives and watch your healthcare costs rise. Facts. So sort of goes against your GOP theory huh?

You have an amazing ability to read words that are not written, it seems to be a gift only brain-addled liberals get. Do you trade your common sense for it?

If for profit insurance companies thought it would increase their bottom line they'd ALREADY be providing that benefit FOR FREE. The FACT is that if that benefit is provided, SOMEBODY, namely the policyholder, is going to PAY for it. In the case of religious organizations, that's just not going to work.

You get the fucking insurance companies to stand up and SWEAR that this benefit won't cost policyholders ONE THIN DIME and you might be able to sway the majority opinion. Short of that it's all a bunch of bullshit.

The majority already understands what I am saying. You think you are a majority when you are actually a fringe thinker?

Its a fact jack. If they don't pay for birth control then they'll pay more for pregnancies.

Or if you want to say we are paying, then if WE don't pay for birth control it is going to raise premiums because of expensive child births.

Fact.

</quote>

Fringe thinker?? You really are full of yourself, aren't you?

Get the insurance companies to TESTIFY or sit down and SHUT THE FUCK UP!!

Sure. Thousands of new voters just drooling <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_drool.gif"/> to vote for Obie.
Less then 5 per cent of the electorate will remember this come next November. (And I'm being generous!).
You are a F'ing idiot!!!
