BTW, your avatar just cracks me up. Really nails Ron Paul. He tries to be the real thing but he's a fake. And, his darling little boy proves that the crumbs don't fall far from the fruitcake.

I'd give a lot for a real Libertarian to run but Paul and his nasty little plutocrat son ain't it. I knew Dave Nolan back in the 70s. I had worked with Dick Lamm who was registered Dem but who was really a closet Libertarian. I'm afraid real Libertarians are long gone now.

Nah,you're wrong about Dr. Paul. You can insult me all you want. Like i give a shit. lol! But you don't know anything about Ron Paul. He's an educated &amp; experienced physician who also served his nation honorably in our Military. What have you ever done for this country? You just sound like another spoiled Entitlement brat. You and Wall Street. So why are you so angry with them? You really aren't any different. You are on the same team.

First I wasn't insulting you. Anyone who would post THAT avatar doesn't think much of Ron Paul and I was insulting him and his posing as a Libertarian.

Second, you don't have a friggin clue about "entitlements" v. Wall Street. Did you even think this through before you said those two are the same or even related?

Entitlements are earned by real people who work for many years for real companies. The Wall Street mess was caused by just the opposite. Why don't you know that? do you have parents who get Social Security? Talk to them.

If you were a Libertarian, you would be very angry with Wall Street.

Now I see that you're just a kid who thinks a president with a light saber would be cool or some such silliness.

Well, good luck with that and be sure to vote for Paul.

lol! I bet you get told you're not a very good listener all the time huh? Read and comprehend. Try it. Who knows,you may even like it. I am very angry with Wall Street for always demanding their handouts from Taxpayers. But i'm also angry with many of you in the OWS Movement who do the same thing. You both have an Entitlement attitude. I think you both need to stop demanding handouts. We're broke for God's sake. Enough is enough.

Why do some of you keep saying that Wall Street fat cats are the same as the working class who pay into their entitlements and then want to draw on them when they retire?

What makes you think Wall Street is "stealing" from fellow citizens?

Jeez. You just make it up as you go along, don't you.

I'm not "IN" the OWS movement.
I've never demanded or gotten a handout. I've worked for everything I have, I'm comfortable and no, you can't have it to give to the 1%.

And, if you think "we're broke", you haven't been paying attention. Educate yourself and stop thinking that Ron Paul is going to save you.

Then why are they protesting? They can still do that. That hasn't changed. They just want their Taxpayer Freebies just like Wall Street does. It is 'Generation Gimme.' But we just can't afford them.
