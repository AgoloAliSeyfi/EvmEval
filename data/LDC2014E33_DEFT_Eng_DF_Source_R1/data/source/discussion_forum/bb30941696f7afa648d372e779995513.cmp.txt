Good spoofs on the styles of Tony Blair and John Reid, respectively.. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"/>

Tony Blair says: 'It's time to start a national debate over whether we should erect two 40ft statues of me at either end of Pall Mall'

The Prime Minister today will announce the need for a 'widespread public conversation' about whether he should best be remembered by having two 40ft-high statues of himself put up in London. 'I'm not saying we should,' he will say.

'All I'm saying is it's important at this stage to rule nothing out before the public has had this unique opportunity to have a chat with me about why we should do this.'

Though funds have already been allocated and voted on for the project, Blair himself insists that things are still 'very much open', because materials haven't yet been chosen nor pose agreed (though he himself favours sitting on top of a pile of city academies looking ahead of him into the windows of a much larger city academy).

Home Secretary John Reid says Polonium-210 is safe but everything else isn't

The Home Secretary today tried to allay public fears over Polonium-210 by asking his wife to gargle with it in front of the cameras.

'Please do not panic,' he told the press. 'The only way it could kill you is if two tons of it fell on your head from an aeroplane. There is absolutely no risk to public safety. 'Everything else, on the other hand, is a very grave threat to the security of this country.

'Lipstick, cough medicine, shoes, and hats may all look safe, but in the hands of terrorists could be suicide bombers in disguise. Walls, bread, handkerchiefs, drums, and hair are all potential sources of the utter destruction of this nation by our enemies.

'Let me be frank; at some time in the not-too-distant future, this country will be destroyed and you will all be killed, unless you heed the warnings I give you.'

this encapsulates exactly the fear and trepidation under which we all now live.

<quote>
Dismayed Labour MPs said Mr Blair seemed "oblivious" to the damage being done to the Government while he refused to give a timetable for his departure. "There is a sense of total frustration across the backbench," said a Labour MP. "It is agony, like watching a car crash in slow motion. Things are just falling apart."

Isn't it pathetic. He lies his country into an unjust and illegal war and then only gets brought down by the kind of payola which has been going on for centuries.

Home Secratary John Reid is slowly drowning in a sea of problems... and they're all of his, or New Labour's, own making. After years of trying to score political points with grandstanding about ASBO's and law and order, they've simply run out of prison space.

The Home Secretary pledged to make his department fit for purpose. But last week its multiple problems threatened to engulf him

Bad forward planning, I'd say, nothing much stronger than that.

But why do we lock up more people than any other comparable country?

Right. As the article notes:

The overall impression is of Reid fighting a losing battle. And last Friday, the scale of the fight became all too apparent. Figures slipped out quietly by the Home Office showed the prison population had jumped by a record 627 in just one week. Even seasoned prison experts were taken aback.

'To put it into context, the prison ship Weare held fewer than 400 people,' said William Higham, head of policy at the Prison Reform Trust. 'John Reid could buy one ship a week at this rate and moor a whole armada of them around the coast without solving the crisis.'

If even your own ever-whipped MPs are starting to make fun of you, you know you're in trouble - at least you do when you're Tony Blair, and you had once been famous for reducing your parliamentary party to a unitary applause machine in a way no Labour leader had ever done before. Simon Hoggart observes:

It's fascinating to watch power dribble away like an Arabian wadi in summer. [..] Mr Blair had to stand there as if he were in the stocks and the village idiot had arrived with a basket of rotten fruit. David Cameron asked him if he didn't realise that it was all over. David Haworth, a Lib Dem, wanted to know if he had "taken the fifth" on the cash for honours scandal, to avoid incriminating himself. Alex Salmond of the SNP compared him to Richard Nixon.

What must really have hurt was the parade of Labour MPs who also wanted to mock and revile him. Tony Wright, usually the least smart-alecky of all, asked silkily "can it be true that we had to pay GPs a lot more money to do a lot less work, and now we have to pay them a lot more money to do the work that we paid them to stop doing?"

All sides collapsed at this carefully crafted jibe. It was the equivalent of the small boy saying that the emperor was not only naked, but pot-bellied, flabby and criss-crossed with varicose veins.

This was after William Hague had queried deputy PM John Prescott (also leaving) about "how it was that, in spite of all the government's initiatives to cut spending, Â£645 had been spent on changing the plate outside his office from Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to read The Deputy's Prime Minister's Office."
