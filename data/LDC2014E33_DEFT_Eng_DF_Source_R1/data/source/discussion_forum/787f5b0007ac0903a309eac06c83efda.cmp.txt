@djjd62,

bullhit. executing someone witha firing quad costs at leats 100 dollars max.

they already paid for the guns, and the ammo should be way less than 100 dollars.

3.wshatever million dollars my ass, thats whats wrong with this fucking country, paper paper paper red tape, oh man lets milk the government for more money for some stupid shit, gee effing gee, AMMO and thats it, plus court costs i guess?

3 million dollars to fuicking kill someone, you could kill like 1000 non-americans with that!

ffs...
