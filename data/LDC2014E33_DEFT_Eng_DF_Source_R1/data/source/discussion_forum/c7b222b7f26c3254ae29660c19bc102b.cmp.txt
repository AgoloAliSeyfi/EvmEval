BANGKOK, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Suspected separatism insurgents launched over ten coordinated strikes in five districts of Thailand's southernmost province of Narathiwat in early Monday morning.

The attacks, which included arson and bombing, took place in Waeng, Joh-I-Rong, Ra-ngae, Janae, and Ba-joh district.

However, no death or injury was reported during the coordinated attacks, which occurred approximately from 5.30 a.m. to 6.30 a.m. local time, according to the website by Thai-language newspaper Matichon.

The country's deep South comprises mainly the three southernmost provinces of Yala, Pattani, Narathiwat and some parts of Songkla province. Over 3,500 people have been killed in insurgent violence in the deep South since January 2004.

Thailand's political trouble has calmed down, but it can flare up again. But as it holds the rotating chair of the 10-nation Association Asean until the end of 2009, it still has an obligation to host the postponed Asean summit.

The venue is now Phuket a southern province away from the troubled Muslim provinces. It should be safer from protests as it is at an island resort linked to the mainland by a roadway.

Let's see how it goes.

<quote>
BANGKOK, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's government Monday said it will propose to other ASEAN leaders and dialogue partner leaders to host the ASEAN Summit and Related Summits during June 13-14 in Thailand's southern province of Phuket.

The proposed date of the summit in June is not finalized since many leaders have not yet confirmed,...

As the Thai government has guaranteed the full safety, however, Deputy Prime Minister Suthep declined to commit whether the safety arrangement would meet the international standard.

Suthep added that local residents in Phuket would not hold any protest against the summit.

The 14th ASEAN Summit and Related Summits were initially scheduled to be held on April 10-12 in a hotel in Thai resort town of Pattaya and the Thai government announced the postponement of it on April 11 after anti-government-red-shirted protestors stormed into the venue.

The dust of political storm in Thailand cannot be settled until there is a good new constitution and new polls. But how?

11 May [ChannelNewsAsia] BANGKOK: Bangkok has returned to normal after protests marred the Songkran holiday, but the political strife is far from over.

Analysts say the upheaval during Songkran holiday was not the last of the red-shirted supporters of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, but for now, their cause is weakened.

However, if Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajivas administration genuinely wants to reconcile the nation, now riven for years by political conflict, it will have to deal with its establishment backers and the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), neither of whom may be happy to hand back electoral dominance to the rural majority.....

Bomb attacks in southern Thailand.

<quote>
27 May [GMANews] YALA, Thailand  A series of bomb and arson attacks believed to have been carried out by Muslim insurgents rocked a provincial capital in southern Thailand early Wednesday, police said.

The attacks, beginning before dawn, were staged at eight locations across the capital of Yala, said police Col. Ekarit Wiriyapap. Yala is one of three provinces in the country's deep south hit by a separatist insurgency that has killed more than 3,400 people since 2004.

No casualties were reported but there was extensive property damage, Ekarit told reporters.....

"The attacks did not aim to kill anyone but rather to cause chaos and intimidate people in the area because there were no people at the time and location of the attacks," he said.

A pro-independence movement has long existed in the predominantly Muslim provinces of Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat. It turned violent in 2004 after a period of relative peace.

Many Muslims feel they have been treated as second-class citizens in a country dominated by Buddhists, but only a few thousand are thought to have taken up arms.
