In spite of the fact that this argument has been made numerous times here....we never seem to see any of the dug-in nutters acknowledge the truth in it.

When lots of people have money to buy necessities AND a few bucks to spend on wants AND a few bucks to save and invest..........................we all benefit. I sure wish that every McDonalds employee had a the cash to remodel their kitchen.

And despite the fact that their way didn't work, won't work, isn't going to work, they will never admit it. Look at how bad things were in 2008 and they basically voted for another 4 years of Bush. That's how brainwashed they are.

Thank God for the 99%ers' They seem to understand the system is rigged. I think most of them are going to vote for Obama again. The economy is getting better and Mitt is against them.

But man are a lot of middle class and even poor Americans brainwashed. I've narrowed it down to God, Gays and Guns. Flat out ignorants. Racist, Stubborness. Or they even might actually possess a gene that you and I don't have. Greed, bitter, always think somoenes out to get theirs. Not realizing they benefit too when we are all in this together.

And I know a lot of very good people who are voting Republican. They have been brainwashed by Fox and/or Rush. But again, they must have the gene that makes them seseptable to it, because all I get from watching Fox is mad.

People have been brainwashed. Now they are set in their ways. All we can do is hope they wake up or stop voting.

Think about what you go along with:

Free but not fair trade
Pollution
Paris Hilton and Shell Oil pay no taxes and you pay 35%
Citizens United
Deregulations to the banks, wallstreet, mortgage industry,
Lied us into a war
Hiring Illegals. Remember Jobs Americans Won't Do? I didn't.
Lowering wages/Breaking Unions. Why? Don't you like 40 hour work weeks and sick days?

Why, because of God Gays or Guns? Or have they convinced you we are socialists because we are pro union/labor? That's the middle class buddy.

What have the poor done to deserve our support?

Don't talk to me. Talk to your "Jesus".

</quote>

And where did Jesus call for forced support thru government over voluntary charity from one's own heart??

For in this country you are free to be generous and nobody stops you... and if you are indeed a miserly and selfish person, you also have the freedom to be such... and nobody has the right, even the government, to force them to support others

He said love your neighbor and take care of the sick and poor. That's what our government is doing.

We are all in this together.

I dont know how to answer with so many assumptions and projections.

You dont have a clue to my views.

Let me help you out, because you people seem to believe collecting that extra 70 billion a year will stop the trillion and half deficit. That deserves mocking. But hey Obama found 300k a year and its the first time democrats didnt immediately aim at heating for the poor.

BFS, Dickhead. I served 23 yrs in the USN and I came from an upper middle class family. While there is a percentage of the poor, most of the people I've met in the Military came from the Middle Class. negged for being stupid.
