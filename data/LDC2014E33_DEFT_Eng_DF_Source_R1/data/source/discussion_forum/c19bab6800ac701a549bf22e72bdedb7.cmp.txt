LOL then you do. The service is the strings attached if you want govt help. if you don't well god bless you the govt can't make you give back to the country that provided you that high standard of living.

the question was, should it be mandated? what was your answer again?

I have no problem with any of this if its not compulsory, I for one probably would have taken advantage of it, but I would have been mortified to find out I didnt have a choice.

America Serves

"When you choose to serve -- whether it's your nation, your community or simply your neighborhood -- you are connected to that fundamental American ideal that we want life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness not just for ourselves, but for all Americans. That's why it's called the American dream."
As the new administration takes shape, Barack Obama and Joe Biden will call on Americans from every walk of life to serve. President-elect Obama and Vice President-elect Biden will expand national service programs like AmeriCorps and the Peace Corps and will create new service organizations to meet the nation's challenges head on:

a Classroom Corps to help underserved schools
a Health Corps to serve in the nation's clinics and hospitals
a Clean Energy Corps to achieve the goal of energy independence
a Veterans Corps to support the Americans who serve by standing in harm's way
Obama and Biden will call on citizens of all ages to serve. They'll set a goal that all middle school and high school students engage in 50 hours of community service a year, and develop a plan for all college students who engage in 100 hours of community service to receive a fully-refundable tax credit of $4,000 for their education. Obama and Biden will encourage retiring Americans to serve by improving programs available for individuals over age 55, while at the same time promoting youth programs such as Youth Build and Head Start.

The Obama-Biden administration's volunteer initiatives are still taking shape, but take a moment now to let us know that you're interested, and we'll keep you posted on all the latest developments.

Enter your information below to let us know you're interested in serving the nation -- and contributing your energy and efforts to confronting the problems we face together.

Obama reflected on how the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy both made public service hallmarks of their administration and how the nation was the better for such efforts.
He promised to increase AmeriCorps slots from 75,000 to 250,000 and pledged to double the size of the Peace Corps by 2011.

"We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives we've set," he said. "We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.

WASHINGTON - A Republican congressman from Georgia said Monday he fears that President-elect Obama will establish a Gestapo-like security force to impose a Marxist dictatorship.

" It may sound a bit crazy and off base, but the thing is, he's the one who proposed this national security force," Rep. Paul Broun said of Obama in an interview Monday with The Associated Press. "I'm just trying to bring attention to the fact that we may — may not, I hope not — but we may have a problem with that type of philosophy of radical socialism or Marxism."
Obama's idea endorsed by Bush
The Obama transition team declined to comment on Broun's remarks. But spokesman Tommy Vietor said Obama was referring in the speech to a proposal for a civilian reserve corps that could handle postwar reconstruction efforts such as rebuilding infrastructure — an idea endorsed by the Bush administration.

There is a write up about a future program. Like the majority of us have said, if it's volunteer it could be a good thing, if it's not it's a bad thing.

That would depend on what programs were "approved" for credit. If one can get credit for working with an anti-"O" NPO, then it's not. If you have to work for Greenpeace, it is.

That really doesn't make it any better in my book. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/wink.gif"/>

the question was Should Obama's Service Plan be mandated? the answere should be no, if its yes then it "fascmmunist", if its volunteer, then it could be a good thing.

When I was growing up, the schools taught that the whole point of forming a Republic was to create a government that served the people, not a people that served the government.

I have heard it said that "the past is a another country and they do things differently there". I guess that man was right.
