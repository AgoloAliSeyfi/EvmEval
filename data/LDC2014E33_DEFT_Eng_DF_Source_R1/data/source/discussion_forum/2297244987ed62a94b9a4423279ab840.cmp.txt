also, people think it's going to hit the bankers purse - the idea that 'they got us into this mess, they can pay up for it'.....stupid stupid stupid. do people not realize what Investment banks are happy to do? they pay their so-called w anker bankers in SHARES - instead of getting paid 1million cash, you get it in shares - so when you sell the shares you don't get taxed income tax, you get capital gains tax - at 18% !!!!!!...so bankers, will end up paying less percentage tax than someone in the lowest tax bracket!!!! this increase in tax to 50% (61.5% if you include National insurance) is going to increase this practice further.

ironically, this increase in tax is going to make 'w anker bankers' richer - if you increase tax, you encourage share payments - it has to be noted that, at the moment, shares are very cheap and oversold...hence their 1million pound shares bonus will actually increase in value considerably over the next 10 years...meaning this brilliant 50% tax is going to increase this whole shady practice and so make bankers richer....well done Labour, great policy. if only you labour voters realized Gordon Brown is treating you like thick poor people who will fall for the bait...this tax will not help....

the only people this tax will hurt is people in our society who we all respect - doctors, surgeons etc, who will be genuinely hit by this tax, who clearly had no part to play in this recession. so well done Gordon Brown, tax the honest, hardworking people and try and convince poor people that they come under the 'w anker banker' category.

High earners dodging tax is not a reason not to increase it - should shops close down because people shoplift? Maybe if they didn't try and hide their money there wouldn't be a need for an increase.

And sorry to be petty, but the shift key is there for a reason!

It's half their money over the 150k threshold. I really didn't think I'd need to clarify this.

Firstly, when I told that person they didn't understand the tax system, I was correct as they didn't. And it was very relevant because they were making unfounded allegations about the impact of the 50% tax rate on high income earners.
Secondly, I don't understand why you quoted me and responded with that message, as 99% of it was not in relation to anything I've said in this post <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/confused.gif" alt=":confused:"/>
At no point did I say "tax the bankers, they got us into this mess".

No. I do understand the tax system. I'm very aware that the tax system is banded so that in this instance the 50% applies to any money earned over 150,000k. I'm not a dunce and I paid tax in the UK for well over 10 years before moving to the US so I know how it works.
