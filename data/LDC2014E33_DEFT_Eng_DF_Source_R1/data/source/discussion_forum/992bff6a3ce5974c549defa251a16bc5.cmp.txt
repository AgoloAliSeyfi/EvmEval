I find this fascinating. Obama's approval ratings are hovering below 50%, yet he has made the list for the 4th year in a row. To me, this says that Americans are willing to give Obama the benefit of the doubt in 2012. Once his re-election campaign is in full gear, his accomplishments will come into the light (his failures have been made all too apparent by Fox News.)

Perhaps they are starting to realize that the president isn't a cure-all for a damaged economy. They understand that that there are many other factors to be considered (i.e. the politics of Congress).

That, of course, is just my opinion.

And an opinion based on very little meaningful analysis it is.

The poll asked about 1000 people who they admired the most: About 170 said "Obama."

That means 830 admired someone ELSE.

You do understand the concept of representable samples, right?

About 83% of those polled said 'someone else', and not Obama.

You do understand the concept of math, right?

No, you missed/purposely ignored the point.

From that list 83% said someone OTHER than Obama.

You do realize this is nothing more than a popularity contest right? Just look at the names on the list. There are far better people that should be on there, the Medal of Honor recipients for starters). These names are just those that are the most familiar at the moment. This is one of the problems with this country. The "American Idol" mentality too many people have.
