The poor Obama/OWS supporters,they must be so damn confused on what their Talking-Points should be. Some come here everyday boasting about how well Wall Street is doing,not realizing they're supposed to hate Wall Street. Clearly their Talking-Point signals have been severely crossed up. Do they love Wall Street? Do they hate Wall Street? Who knows? They don't even know. I guess all that HuffPoop and MSLSD stuff isn't helping them much. Stick around a bit longer and you're sure to see an Obama/OWS supporter here crowing about how great Wall Street is doing. It's pretty bizarre but very funny too.

Boasting about it as Obama demonizes them on one hand and garners campaign funds from them all in the same breath...

Astounding.

The sheep are confused by the actions of thier herders.

Yeah,there are a few rabid loyal Obama/OWS supporters who routinely come here crowing about how well Wall Street is doing. It's hilarious everytime i see them doing that. They don't have a clue as to what their Talking-Points should be anymore. Should they love Wall Street? Should they hate Wall Street? They're just so confused. I guess they see Wall Street doing well as somehow a benefit to their guy in the White House. So they they're torn between cheerleading for Wall Street and hating Wall Street. They just don't know which Talking-Point to embrace. Stick around awhile longer and i'm sure you'll see a couple of them expressing this confusion. It's some fun entertainment.

Indeed. You try to educate them and it is roundly rejected. So why not laugh at thier foibles as a consolation prize? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

the OWS mission was the change the narrative from deficits to income inequity.

In that sense OWS was successful.

</quote>

Actually, it changed the narrative from deficits to "hey, look at those trustafarians camping out in the middle of the city, smoking dope, raping each other and shitting all over the place," then it went back to deficits. But at least those brats think they had their own little Woodstock moment, which counts for something, I suppose.

OWS changed the discussion. That alone is a major victory. If the Dems follow up, and use the real inequities that exist in our system, present remedies for those inequities, we may see some real progress this election.

</quote>

You do know, don't you, that your saintlike Dems are perpetuating and profiting from those inequities?

They don't give a shit about you, Roxy. But you just keep blindly pulling that D lever.

</quote>

No shit. Voting for the people that are taking advantage...stuffin' thier pockets...and 'the other guys' are responsible.

The sheep are indeed bleating...
