It was understood at the time that unless the Japanese surrendered, we would lose as many as a half a million to a million of our fighting men to finally defeat the Japanese Empire. And the Japanese were not going to surrender. The citizenry was being trained in how to fight to the last man, woman and child.

It took the atomic bomb to prove to them that it was futile. And even the first one didn't turn the trick.

Compared to how many of OUR soldiers' lives were at stake -- not even counting the many fold MORE Japanese lives that would be lost -- the math alone underscores a tragic (but real) morality in going atomic.

A horrible, horrifying and wrenching decision by President Truman? Absolutely.

But immoral?

Based on the quantification of human life, the decision was far more moral than the alternative.

This is the same exact line that's been proven wrong on several levels.

The bombs did not make Japan change its conditions for surrender. At. All.

Straight up LIE. Before the bombs Japan wanted us to agree to a cease fire and a return to our 1941 start lines. They wanted no foreign presence in Japan, no Change of Government and no change of the Military. After the first bomb they still tried to make demands they want 4 things only one of which was the Emperor. After 2 bombs and a Soviet declaration of War they agreed to surrender and WE agreed to let them keep their Emperor as a FIGURE head only. The final surrender was UNCONDITIONAL. As evidenced by the Documents the Japanese signed.

You have yet to provide us with all the supposed surrender attempts by Japan in 1945. You keep making the claim but provide absolutely no evidence of such.

There is nothing that can be posted that you would pay attention to unless it appeared to re-affirm your pre-maturely developed position. I've already posted evidence that you flat out ignore but demand more......

Targeting civilians or civilian population centers is always unethical; using weapons of mass destruction makes the situation unimaginably worse from a moral standpoint. By 1945, Japan's military had been crippled to the point of ineffectiveness. A bombing campaign against strategic military and industrial targets could have been carried out with minimal casualties among the US military as well as among Japan's civilian population.

One of the reasons the sites were chosen was based on creating an atomic barometer. They needed to drop the bombs in places that were very much in tact to measure the damage and fall out.

That is exactly what happened: two atomic bombs and the Soviet invasion ended the war with very little casualties to Americans. No atomic bombs, no surrender.

You are now engaged in the immorality of stubbornness. Your assertion has flatly been disproved. You can't admit it, which says very poorly about your character.
