The OWS movement rails about "greed", like we can outlaw an emotion.
But what is greed? Is someone who works hard because he wants to get ahead greedy? I don't think anyone would say so.
It seems greed is wanting money that legitimately doesn't belong to you. I can be as greedy as I want, but unless someone gives me money voluntarily then it doesn't do much. If I deceive someone, then I am a criminal. But if I deliver on what I've promised then I've earned my money.
By that definition the OWS crowd are the greedy ones. They demand their student loans get paid off, yet they've done nothing to deserve that. They demand--well, I dont know what they want. Neither do they. But demanding someone else's money is greed.

Greed is one of the Seven Deadly Sins of the Bible:

<quote>
1909 painting The Worship of Mammon by Evelyn De Morgan.Greed (Latin, avaritia), also known as avarice or covetousness, is, like lust and gluttony, a sin of excess. However, greed (as seen by the church) is applied to a very excessive or rapacious desire and pursuit of wealth, status, and power. St. Thomas Aquinas wrote that greed was "a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things." In Dante's Purgatory, the penitents were bound and laid face down on the ground for having concentrated too much on earthly thoughts. "Avarice" is more of a blanket term that can describe many other examples of greedy behavior. These include disloyalty, deliberate betrayal, or treason,[citation needed] especially for personal gain, for example through bribery. Scavenging[citation needed] and hoarding of materials or objects, theft and robbery, especially by means of violence, trickery, or manipulation of authority are all actions that may be inspired by greed. Such misdeeds can include simony, where one profits from soliciting goods within the actual confines of a church.

If we want to stamp out lust we can start with Congress.
But this isn't about the 7 Deadlies. It is about the definitin of greed. How do you separate greed from ambition?

Greed can mean an excessive desire for getting or having something, especially money, but greed is not always a bad thing. Greedy people can be, by virtue of their own ambitions, very benevolent and are often charitable people who also employ many others and sign their paychecks. There will always be greed, however one defines that, and there will always be people who benefit from greedy people. Greed can be a very good thing. It can mean JOBS.

What you are describing is ambition, not greed. I maintain greed is wanting what doesn't belong to you rightfully. By that definition the OWS people are greedy.
