It's the same as the government being between you and a doctor with universal healthcare. The only difference is the government will put all the competition out of business and then Americans will have only one provider. At least with our current system there is some competition.

Funny how the private companies spend about 31 cents out of ever dollar on administration. Medicare spends about 3 cents.
That's why the private companies can't compete... they're bloated.

the same was said about the Post Office.....look at UPS and FedX....compitition took away a hell of a lot of the parcel business and overnight deliveries....the only one BLOATED is the govt one...so much for CANT COMPETE....

the USPS delivers most everywhere and this analogy is similar to putting up side by side Charter schools next to Public schools. APples and oranges--still fruit, but no cigar.

Nice liberal spin. Here's the truth:

But like many core beliefs of the left, the claim that government-run health care has lower administrative costs than private care is just plain false. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, for example, likes to cite data showing that Medicare only spends 3% of its total outlays on administrative costs compared to 14-22% for private care. The numbers themselves are correct, but measuring administrative efficiency by a percentage of total costs is completely useless. Heritage fellow Robert Book explains:

Imagine, for a moment, that Fred and Jane each have a credit card from a different bank. Fred charges $5,000 a month, and Jane charges $1,000 a month. Suppose it costs each bank $5 to produce and send a plastic credit card when the account is opened. That $5 administrative cost is a much lower percentage of Freds monthly charges than it is of Janes, but that does not mean Freds bank is more efficient. It is purely a mathematical artifact of Freds charging pattern, and it would be silly to compare the efficiency of bank operations on that basis. Yet that is how many analysts compare Medicare with private insurance.

A much more accurate way of capturing each systems true administrative costs is by a per-patient basis. When this is done, government-run health cares administrative costs are routinely higher than private care. In the years from 2000 to 2005, Medicares administrative costs per beneficiary were consistently higher than that for private insurance, ranging from 5 to 48 percent higher, depending on the year. This is despite the fact that private-sector administrative costs include state health insurance premium taxes of up to 4 percent (averaging around 2 percent, depending on the state)an expense from which Medicare is exemptas well as the cost of non-claim health care expenses, such as disease management and on-call nurse consultation services.

A Heritage fellow pulling facts together to attack a government program. What else is new. I wonder how his data was collected and how it was manipulated.

Do you want an insurance company employee telling you what you need and what you don't need when it comes to you and your family's health?

It is EXACTLY the same thing.

Of course it's the same thing... both are bureaucrats. The private bureaucrat is more likely to deny you coverage.
