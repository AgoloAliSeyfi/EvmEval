Hi all

Basically my mum died a couple of weeks ago, she had never discussed dying so when we were with the funeral directors we didnt know if she wanted to be cremated or buried, he suggested we try and find her will as it is normally in there.
Me and my 2 sisters looked through her house but couldnt find one anywhere.
Since then another relative has said she had destroyed her old will and made a new one leaving everything to charity, if this will does exist we have no idea where it is, my father died many years ago and we all know there is no way he would have wanted everything he had worked for over the years not to be passed to his children.
My main question is what happens now? As we stand there is no will that we know of anywhere.
Does it automatically get split between me and my sisters or do we have to try and track down this other will?
Have tried reading round but searching the word will on google brings everything but will and testament
Anyone who has been in this kind of position plse let me know how you went about everything and what we need to do

thanks

Hi, so sorry to hear about your mum <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/frown.gif"/> I was in your situation back in June when my dad passed away very suddenly. He was only 67 and we had never had any form of conversation about what he wanted when he died, and he and my mum split up 10 years ago, he didn't have a new partner. I didn't know if he wanted to be buried or cremated, so me and his sister went with cremation as that is what happened to his other sister and parents, then we scattered his ashes in the sme place <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/frown.gif"/>

I couldn't find a will either. I found paperwork from a financial meeting he had with the bank in which he said he did have one, but i don't know if he just said this cos i couldn't find one anywhere when i sorted through his house. We are now preceeding as if he didn't have a will (he is classed as dying intestate). Legally you only have to make reasonable efforts to locate the will, so i phoned local solicitors he had dealings with, along with his 2 banks who sometimes hold wills. No one i phoned had any record of a will for him, so the solicitors are happy to proceed along this line. Hope that helps
