Im not sure if I have any ptsd, I know what the doctors tried to tell me I have, but my case is a little different. Worst part of Iraq lasted about 48hours just prior to me coming home. Im desensitized to most things, like dead people, and really really dead people. People die whether its car accident or battle. Seeing mutated corpses don't bother me. I seen piles of dead human beings. That's nothing new in Iraq.
Smells bothered me when I returned home. I cant stand to smell of cooking food. It reminds me of skins being burned, I don't like the smell of hot metal- certain kinds of metal smell worse than others when hot. I was in Iraq, everything is hot. The smells of cooked engines piss me off. The smell of diesel really pisses me off. The smell of gun powder smoke dont bother me to much, but it take me there. The sound of fireworks in the distance makes me think air strikes..

Reality is, I was there before and returned again. But when I went the first time. I come back home to my family. When I came back home the second time. The police had killed my bother, my ex with newborn vanished. There was nobody waiting for me to come home. I was served with warrants by the state police on the air nation guard base here in pgh.. Thanks for all the fine work you did in Iraq. Here is an arrest warrant for you, But they were for things my bother did. I was not detained but once again, I just wanted to run away from it... I had to face the pig justice system. Since my legal problems were cleared up, expunged, entire case dissolved against the sheriffs office. Its like that whole little legal business didnt even exist. But it did. They cant bring back my bother. In fact 3 people in my family died while I was serving in Iraq. My Bother, Aunt, Uncle and mysteriously this old women that was also involved in my court case. She was the judges mother. So I can play conspiracy games all day, it really isn't going to do me any good. And its not going to do me any good to go on a shooting spree, build a back pack bomb, attack a bus load of people. Nothing I could do will change the face of the past. Harming innocent people isn't going to get your message across. You could kill an entire police force. Its not going to effect the world one bit. Only the news hounds will make a fortune on the misery of others. It would be posted on the internet for a few days, and into the past it will go. They will dig thru your personal crap looking to blame more than themselves for what happened.

What kind of outlets did this veteran have? Where was he getting treatment. What medications was he on?... I dont take medications other than cannabis. They tried to give me all kinda of brain damaging shit. Mention cannabis and they roll their fucking eyes. Well cannabis makes me feel better. Isnt the point of treatment to make the patient feel better?

Truth is I closed the book on the treartment the VA was giving me. The dont identify me as a real preson,.. you see Im a transgender person and thats a big fucking NO NO when it comes to veteran treatment. I go to a private clinic for transgender people, I get treated like a Human being, NOT A TOOL.. I am not a robot, unless I feel like dressing up as one..

As well I cope with things better as my true self.. My true self hasnt ever changed. I just went on a little ride with some bad people. But I did some good things for the people of Iraq and Afghanistan. Many times I can see the faces of the people I helped. But I can also see the faces of the people I horrified..

May Allah bless us all and give guidance to follow the right path and do no more harm..

Society trains our soldiers to kill in time of war and yet expects them to respect life in time of peace. And for people who have gone through that experience life is cheap and with a shell-shocked mind can be extremely dangerous to themselves and to others <img src="images/smilies/frown.gif"/>

Often, none of that seems to matter once they've been used as means toward achieving an end desired by the machine.

I know a few people with PTSD. It ranges in severity from getting a little nervous at the sound of fireworks to talking about killing people like it means nothing to you to drinking every day just to cope and having intense breakdowns every night.

I think a good support network upon returning home helped all these guys. Not all soldiers have that.

Maybe this incident will force the military to focus on processing these soldiers with a little more care when they return from war.

Of course, like Orison said, treatment usually involves forcing a bunch of medication down your throat. This guy could very well be on some kind of powerful psychoactive that influenced his actions moreso than PTSD.
