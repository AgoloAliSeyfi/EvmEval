I have family in sweden and it is not as rosy as people think, especially the social democrats in the UK. They have gone through a long period of privatisation and turned the country round since the 70's and 80's, even further privatisation destroyed a lot of their debt and unemployment in the 90's. Small homogeneous population, similar people, similar interests, mutual understanding, good work ethic, good education (most of which operates under a voucher system, contrary to the socialised system people are deluded with). Their manufacturing industry is also healthy, lots of natural resources aswell as VERY skilled labour in areas of production, especially metals and chemicals. They also have a skilled generation that constantly renews itself, speaking english and strong physics skills are 2 primary areas of education, or so from what I have observed.

They have been practacing capitalism as near perfect as it should be, a well defined and separated free market (aside from the bank industry) and a well defined public sector which actually works in the interests of the people and is efficient due to a market mechanism they have put in place, though social welfare is now seeing some areas of decay, as it always will. They used to treat it as a real safety net, but it becoming a bit of a fishing net in malmo at the moment.

The welfare state is crumbling in a few big cities however, there is a lot of crime in places like malmo, growing numbers of rape, more gang violence, growing anti-semitism, free speech is gradually being suppressed. Their immigration is the cause and the problem is in many ways worse than ours, they really did have an open borders policiy and up until only last year (as opposed to us in 06') stopped it. In our country a lot of our social problems aren't due to immigration at all, immigration has brought more benefits over-all, aslong as it is moderated, and multi-ethnicism not multi-culturalism are encouraged, this is very healthy for our country. Sweden this is different though, as with Holland and Norway aswell now. I'm afraid, their good nature and tolerance has been hijacked and they are paying the price, their aren't taking any s***, Scandinavia has made a significant step to the right on this sole issue.

Evidence of that? I have family in Sweden and the welfare state is hugely important to everyone in the country by all accounts, they also think that the lack of social welfare provision in the United Kingdom and the United States is vulgar and uncivilised.

Urgh, I never said they want rid of social welfare or want to drastically minimise it but they want it audited and re-organised, many want a swede first policy, which is what the United opposition are propeosong, who lost by less that 100K votes in 2010 and keep rising whilst the social democracts are falling..... fast.

Not really, most of the lost SDP votes went to the Greens.
