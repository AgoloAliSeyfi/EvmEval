A company that hires through a temp service.

A temp service always has 2 customers, at least.

One to bring people in for the pay.
And one that just sucks that almost no one will take.

When the big payer ends, the temp co can offer the worker the shitty job, hoping they won't take it, so it's a voluntary quit and thus no UE&gt;

Actually, as an owner of a temporary placement agency (we are a business planning and human resources solutions firm in the NYC area), it does not actually work that way. We can not offer a temp a lower salary and then deny him/her unemployment if he/she rejects the assignment. It willbe a valid rebuttle and we would lose.

Furthermore, we would never want to alienate a good tempoorary employee with such an act. Maybe some of the smaller shops that try to maximize revenue at the cost of quality service do...but as someone in the industry for over two decades, 75% of that time as an owner, that is only successful for the short term. For your inventory (temps) is at a constant and constantly rotating in and out. You need to grow inventory to grow revenue.

What many people dont realize is we value our temps as much as we value our clients. We must perform superior customer service for all of them.

I never had any luck with the temp agencies, one time I got a voice mail from one of them saying they had a job for me. I called back, and the lady said sorry since you didn't answer we offered the job to the next person on the list who answered the phone, that didn't make any damn sense to me.

Part of our business is very time sensitive. We may get a call from a client saying that they need something and called another service as well..and the one who performs the quickest gets the order. We explain that to our tempos when they apply with us so they understand the importance of always being reachable..to the best oif their ability.

We have some temps that make great money with us. Great relationships. We give them bonuses this time a year. Last few years they werent overly impressive...but the appreciation was there...and returned with GREAT quality and a great representation of our firm.

I suggest you spread yourself out. It is a matter of establishing yourself with one who sees your differential...whatever it may be. Present yourself as confident, reliable, and willing to do whatever you can to represent them at the highest of levels.....dont make it like "I need to make money...or....im desperate...or....Im doing this only so unemployemtn sees I am looking for a job.

Instead, make it like you are an asset to them.....not that they are an asset to you.

You will find you are treated with great respect with that typoe of approach.

I was application support for trading and market data systems. I also helped build out NOCs, RNOCs, contigency floors and data centers. I was the SME for a proprietary application that we sold to customers. Before that I did consulting for application and hardware migrations. I have admin level experience with HPUX, SUSE, and RHEL. Applications and OS's that I am familiar with include TIDAL/BIG BROTHER/HP Openview/TANDEM NonStop/Remedy/Service Now/Tripwire/Perforce. I've trained ITIL v1, v2 and v3. I can write PERL/KSH scripts and use SQL. And I just completed a CCNA class...so I am studying to take the certification test. That..and I make a really mean omlette! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

Well...for starters.....If you look anything like your avatar, I think I may know what your problem is and why you cant find a job. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_whistle.gif"/>

I just copied and pasted your qulifications on a word doc. I am going to make some calls to people I kow that do tech and see if your qualificatiuons are something they may be able to present to a client.

If I get any positive repsonse, I will PM you...and do something I am very much against doing...but would do iot for you....give you my personal/business information.

And if I do...just an fyi...I have a very vicious puggle guarding my house.

I suppose you can call anything a bubble if you like..and point to things to support your point.

My understanding of a "bubble" is a sector that is artificial propped up..despite weak demand. Like the "Housing" bubble at the beginning of the Bush administration.

There is Strong demand for US education. And that's world wide.

Low cost loans, credit not a problem. Try thinking beyond that. Add state government increasing funding to buy votes. One Result is higher tuition. But those teachers deserve all that money and perks on the tax payer dime right?

</quote>

Yep.

People are just standing in lines waitin' to become teachers. Hoo boy. And cab drivers too! Although I think cab drivers pay slightly better.

Just say, the topic is beyond your understanding and its all good.

Great move having government take over loans and reduce the payment. You will be paying longer and more interest. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_clap.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_clap.gif"/>
