I never had any luck with the temp agencies, one time I got a voice mail from one of them saying they had a job for me. I called back, and the lady said sorry since you didn't answer we offered the job to the next person on the list who answered the phone, that didn't make any damn sense to me.

Part of our business is very time sensitive. We may get a call from a client saying that they need something and called another service as well..and the one who performs the quickest gets the order. We explain that to our tempos when they apply with us so they understand the importance of always being reachable..to the best oif their ability.

We have some temps that make great money with us. Great relationships. We give them bonuses this time a year. Last few years they werent overly impressive...but the appreciation was there...and returned with GREAT quality and a great representation of our firm.

I suggest you spread yourself out. It is a matter of establishing yourself with one who sees your differential...whatever it may be. Present yourself as confident, reliable, and willing to do whatever you can to represent them at the highest of levels.....dont make it like "I need to make money...or....im desperate...or....Im doing this only so unemployemtn sees I am looking for a job.

Instead, make it like you are an asset to them.....not that they are an asset to you.

You will find you are treated with great respect with that typoe of approach.

Mr. Obama? Is that you?

If it is, you're going to be losing that job in about a year.

So you may want to consider my advice.

Great time to add another fee to those taking out mortgages then.

Why?

My tongue was planted firmly in my cheek, referring to the new fee in the payroll extension that dings folks getting or renewing mortgages.

It's no "bubble". The world comes to the United States to educate it's people.

The United States Colleges and Universities are top flight..bar none.

</quote>

OMG....there is no way you just denied that education is a bubble market right now. You didn't.

Wow.

</quote>

I suppose you can call anything a bubble if you like..and point to things to support your point.

My understanding of a "bubble" is a sector that is artificially propped up..despite weak demand. Like the "Housing" bubble at the beginning of the Bush administration.

There is Strong demand for US education. And that's world wide.

Um...what?
Using your definition - there was no housing bubble.
A bubble is a market that is artificially propped up for any reason. Including creating an ARTIFICIAL demand.
Education demand is false. It is not reality. We have eons of kids who couldn't graduate high school getting 4 year loans including room and board. No college in their right mind would accept these kids in the past, and not one bank would give them a loan prior to the government guaranteeing the loan.
Colleges are filled with kids who don't belong there. And the only reason they are there is because of insane student loan practices that are identical in everyway to the insane mortgage loan practices.

20 bucks a week isn't? Especially when you give 1 week a month back if you ever get or renew another mortgage.
