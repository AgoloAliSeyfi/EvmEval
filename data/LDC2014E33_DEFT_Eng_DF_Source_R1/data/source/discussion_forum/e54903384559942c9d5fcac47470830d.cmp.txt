I just checked the EIA charts for the last 3 years &amp; other than (Other OECD) Crude Oil production is rising in every sector of the globe.

United States........ Production is Rising
Other OECD.......... Production is Declining
Total OECD............ Production is Rising
Non-OECD............. Production is Rising
OPEC5.................. Production is Rising
Former U.S.S.R..... Production is Rising
Other Non-OECD.... Production is Rising
Total Non-OECD..... Production is Rising
Total World Supply. Production is Rising

is linking beyond your intrawebz skill level, or are you purposely not linking and hoping no one asks you for context?

I gave you the source. I said it was from the EIA. It is a Excel spreadsheet. <a href="http://www.eia.gov/emeu/ipsr/t21.xls">Here is the link.</a> They always manage to keep production in line with demand so it is hard to tell what is really going on. If a pipeline gets blown up in Nigeria it drops their sector &amp; others rise to compensate. There is always spare capacity. As the charts below show, when demand dropped because of the recession then so did supply. Now that demand is rising so is supply. We are currently way over supplied. There is a oil glut in "Floating Storage" <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29495753/">Oil producers running out of storage space.</a>

Earlier this decade, people were worried the U.S. was running out of natural gas... a vital commodity we use to produce chemicals, heat our homes, and generate electricity. From 1980 to 1999, domestic natural gas reserves fell 18%. Production only grew 1% a year on average. In short, we were pumping out more than we were finding... for nearly two decades.

Then, about 10 years ago, two incredible technologies entered the industry in a big way: Hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. Through the use of these technologies, we've learned that the U.S. sits on top of an incredible amount of natural gas. We've gone from dwindling reserves and plans to import gas... to boasting the world's second-largest hoard of the stuff, just behind Russia. You want energy security? You want natural gas.

Shale rock is thin layers of fine-grain sediment, stacked like pages in a book. There is nearly no "conductivity" in shale, which means fluids like oil and gas can't move through it. But shales are typically full of organic material and hold enormous amounts of oil and gas locked up inside.

In my college days, we learned shale was the oil and gas "kitchen," the source of the black gold we wanted to find. Some of the good stuff would migrate out into sand stones, where we could get it out. Other than thinking about them as source rocks, we ignored shale... until hydraulic fracturing opened our eyes.

Fracking is a process that uses high-pressure fluids to force the layers of shale apart. Carried in the fluid are tiny grains of "proppant"  sand or ceramic spheres  that hold the layers of shale open after the pressure from the fluid fades.
