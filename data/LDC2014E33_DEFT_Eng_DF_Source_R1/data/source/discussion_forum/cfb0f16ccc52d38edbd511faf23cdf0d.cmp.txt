I'm more interested in why one dry quart (&amp; gallon) is different from a wet quart (&amp; gallon).

There's a pretty good common <a href="http://www.hoptechno.com/nightcrew/sante7000/convert.cfm">converter</a> bere.

Interestingly this converter doesn't include a hectare (1 ha=10000m^2=(100m)^2) which is a pretty good unit of area--far handier to remember than the US acre (1 Acre= 43560 ft^2).

BTW 1ha=2.47 Acre, and I remember acre by knowing there are 640 of em in a square mile.

My dearly departed souldmate and best friend used to sing that ditty---to me and our children.

Boomerang - I don't know much about measurements, but I do know about the song. It's from Guys and Dolls, and done as a performance song within the show by the character of Adelaide with several "showgirls" for backup. They do this number dressed as farm girls (straw hats, gingham blouses, and denim shorts in the last production I worked on). Hence the farm references. Oh, and the word that rhymes with sleep is actually heap, which I'm guessing is a non-specific measurement. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"/> My mom used to sing it to me, too.

I love you, a bushel and a peck
A bushel and a peck, and a hug around the neck
A hug around the neck, and a barrel and a heap
A barrel and a heap, and I'm talkin' in my sleep
About you
About you
About you
(My heart is leapin'
I'm having trouble sleepin')

'Cause I love you, a bushel and a peck
You bet your pretty neck I do
Doodle, oodle, oodle
Doodle, oodle, oodle
Doodle oodle oodle oo

I love you, a bushel and a peck
A bushel and a peck and it beats me all to heck
Beats me all to heck how I'll ever tend the farm
Ever tend the farm when I want to keep my arms
About you
About you
About you
(The cows and chickens
are goin' to the dickens)

'Cause I love you a bushel and a peck
You bet your pretty neck I do
Doodle oodle oodle
Doodle oodle oodle
Doodle oodle oodle, oo

Good-bye now!
(they repeat the "doodles" as they exit)

@boomerang,

According to one source, the "heap" was the pile from which the farmer filled the barrel, bushel, peck, etc. I could not find a specific measurement for a heap - but it would be a bunch!
(A farmer's daughter - I carried a "heap" of bushels of corn, oats, etc., to our livestock.)

@flutterbybev,

I assume this is why the song was popular.
