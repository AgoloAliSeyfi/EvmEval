Vengeance? Isn't that the kind of thing a liberal should be against? Vengeance brings more vengeance remember?

Funny how those oh so self-righteous liberal sensibilities go out the window when its convenient... Well if its vengeance you seek, take it out on your lifestyle.. After all if you follow the trail back to its source, and get to the core of the entire evil you will find consumerism and modern lifestyles the prime culprit...

If there wasn't an ever increasing need for oil, we wouldn't be drilling there. If there really was a viable alternative oil wouldn't be an issue.

BP nor the owners of the rig wanted a disaster like this, it hurts them publicly, in a very hard and very hard to get past way. not to mention the sheer costs and legalities to follow. Also loss of property, loss of revenue from the oil, and various other things. They did not take shortcuts or skirt any regulations in place, they were just inspected recently and passed.

This was an accident. A very tragic and unfortunate accident and nothing more. They will pay for the clean-up and damages, in fact who do you think will be the main employer of those doing the cleaning? BP will of course just as EXXON did before.

Vengeance? Really? Then look to your car, your house, your boat, your electricity, your medicine, your consumables, your food, your water, and even your very existence.

Perhaps. I think it will take time to analyse what exactly went wrong on the rig...but it really does not matter, legally. The BP Corp. is Strictly Liable for the spill and all its consequences.

I am not a "Greenie". I can throw a plastic container into the trash without weeping. But I protested against the Alaskan Oil Pipeline, I have agitated for/against EPA activities, and I do care about the State of Florida because I lived and loved there.

How innocent of bio-impact must I be before I am ethically able to condemn BP?

And where on Earth did you ever get the idea that all Liberals are sweetie-pies who cannot get angry? Miss the 1960's entirely did ya?

Nice response! Seriously you got me on the 60's remark..... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

I concede that to you...

However, I do feel for the desire to lash out, I cannot stress enough how this is not the way to effect real change.... All this WILL do is push a bill and legislation through that is not designed nor intended to save any environment. Cap and trade is about CO2 and CO2 only, it will not address anything such as this. And whats more giving an opportunity for greedy business men to make the make money off the product AND the effects of using it is the work of insanity in regards to reduction.

I do know BP will pay dearly, as will the owners of the rig, and rightly so. And that in reality is all we can hope to get out of this. There can never be enough legislation to counter every possible thing that can happen. Only thing it does is generate revenue for politicians and government. And whats worse the most of that revenue will go to feeding the infrastructure whose job it is to regulate those new regulations.

We get a law requiring a new switch or cut-off valve, and what would it change? Well the fact is it wouldn't change anything in regards to this spill or any like it. The explosion was beneath where any such switch would have been. And since we cannot regulate natural disasters, or every possible accident imaginable, the legislation is a waste.... Sure it may stop some kinds of accidents which haven't occurred yet to my knowledge, but it will not stop this type of accident..

I am very sorry for the damage to the environment, but new legislation will only feed itself and not change anything...

Regulations don't mattert if those in chgarge of enforcing the regulations reoutinely issue exemptions.

BP has lobbied the White House Council on Environmental Quality -- which provides NEPA guidance for all federal agencies-- to provide categorical exemptions more often. In an April 9 letter, BP America's senior federal affairs director, Margaret D. Laney, wrote to the council that such exemptions should be used in situations where environmental damage is likely to be "minimal or non-existent." An expansion in these waivers would help "avoid unnecessary paperwork and time delays," she added.

boycott....no...calling for the death of the CEO.... YES! The taxpayers are already footing a portion of the bill!!!!! It's called the US Coast Guard and the US Navy being on scene and providing support...do you want them to do the entire clean up now?

</quote>

Well, alright, calling for the death of the CEO is a bit extreme. I'll give you that.

Though if deaths occur from this, like say from cancer from the pollutants, that would be murder by negligence, wouldn't it?

As far as the other part goes, I want BP to pay for this anyway. Personally I don't care if they go bankrupt from legal fees. They fucking destroyed the Gulf! My father's half of the family lives in Tampa.

That would have to be proven in a court of law....a highly unlikely prospect....

and BP didn't destroy the Gulf.....now your sounding like a complete retard....
