@genoves,

In your opinion, genoves, what is so bad about socialism?
I get the general pros and cons, but it seems odd to me because I am from a place where socialism is always used as a positive term, not a negative.

@panzade,

I don't, of course, read the Possum's posts--on those few occasions when i have, and have responded, i've always realized it's foolish and a waste of time, because all it wants is an opportunity to pick a fight, and it is never interested in the accuracy of it's statements.

I did think, though, that it would worth while to point out that "quote mining" is part of the Possum's MO. Quote mining is taking someone's remarks, and taking portions of them out of context to attempt to distort the actual meaning of what the person in question has said. This is a favorite technique of the creationists, who love to indulge quote mining to make it appear that reputable scientists reject a theory of evolution.

It works just as well, of course, with political hysteria.

@Setanta,

That just proves that when the multi-cloned Possum has his head up his ass which is most of the time, it's only covering his eyes and ears but his mouth and fingers unfortunately still work. His vain attempt to accuse others of claiming intelligence is a screen for wanting us to believe what he writes is intelligent. There's no other alternative unless what he writes is instead, stupid and regressive, and copied from a Google search.

********************************
You note, of course, Panzade, that there is no one on this thread named Possum.
Could it be that Setanta is doing an Ad Hominem. He piously asserts that he is not in favor or Ad Hominems but he indulges in them routinely.

If you are really interested, Panzade, you might want to go back to note the savage attacks on me by Setanta and others AFTER THEY DISCOVERED THAT THEY COULD NOT REBUT MY POSTS AND AFTER I SHOWED THEY WERE IN ERROR.

But, why should you do such work.

Setanta indicates that I am not interested in the accuracy of statements. Well, anyone who really wants to do so can see if my posts and my points do indeed REBUT Setanta over and over.

If he really thinks that I cherry pick my points, Panzade, why it is easy for a professor (ex?) like Setanta, who has won plaudits throughout the world for his incisive commentary on Historical events, could easily show where I was wrong.

The fact is, Panzade, that I rubbed Setanta's nose in it with my exposition, where I gave evidence that Setanta did not, indeed, could not, rebut, to the effect that the NAZIS were, in many respects, left wingers, not right wingers, in their policies and proposals.

One point serves to show how Setanta was wrong. The Nazis( which I proved in my posts giving direct evidence and quotes were strongly opposed to Christianity and Roman Catholics in Germany. Only someone who either knows nothing about the period or about the Catholic Church can call the Nazis "right-wing" in that respect.

The left, Stalin, especially, opposed the Church. The Catholic Church in the twentieth century must be viewed as a conservative right wing force.

And the Nazis were against the Catholic Church.

These, and scores of other points, Panzade, are points which Setanta dare not address since it will show that his old notes( cribbed from Howard Zinn's books?) are mainly erroneous.

Setanta, Panzade, is just an intellectual coward!
