I talked to one of my Republican friends today, and she said her 18 year old daughter got pregnant because she didn't have enough money to pay for birth control.

And she's a REPUBLICAN.

These are real life issues that women understand better than men.

Republican or Democrat, any girl not smart enough to get BC from Planned Parenthood DESERVES the consequences of her STUPIDITY. My God, this issue is NOT about access to birth control, you can get it almost ANYWHERE for FREE!!

This issue is about forcing unwilling people to PAY for it, one fucking way or another!

Wait a minute. Clearly by your comment you were in favor of cutting funding to Planned Parenthood, and now you want to use it as a source women can use to get free birth control?

Are you sure Planned Parenthood still exists after all the cuts/changes the GOP made during the Debt Ceiling fiasco?

Now listen and listen good. Free market For Profit PRIVATE insurance companies did a cost analysis on birth control and decided it would save them money if they provide contraception as preventative medicine. Much cheeper than paying for a child birth.

So you aren't paying for it. Its saving you money. Stop paying for contraceptives and watch your healthcare costs rise. Facts. So sort of goes against your GOP theory huh?

Georgetown will NOT run a cost analysis I bet.

Even back to the oldie days when they talked about Thomas Jefferson's mistress or slandered Andrew Jackson's wife.

Edith Wilson took a lot of heat also; she accepted it like a woman, and the JOB.

Edith Wilson kind of had it coming. What she did, essentially, keeping the Vice President and Congress in the dark about Wilson's incapacity, was reprehensible and had terrible consequences for the country.

The keyword is 'force'. It is obvious that liberals like S-Bobo are control freaks whom want to impose their beliefs on all others through force, since they worship at the altar of Government.
But isn't this the purest expression of Liberalism? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/sad.gif"/>

Looks like the Left is just pissy because they can't beat this dead horse anymore. The man apologized. And that's more than hateful Left nutters ever do. It's over. Time to move on.
