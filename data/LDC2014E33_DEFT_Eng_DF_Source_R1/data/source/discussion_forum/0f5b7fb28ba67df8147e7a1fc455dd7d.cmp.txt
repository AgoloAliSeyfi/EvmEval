Oh puh-lease, I went to an inner-city comprehensive school during Blair's ten year stretch of failure and it was anything but well run. Well funded? You betcha, but stuffed to the gills with Labour's other main failure: forcing every single half baked social-liberal idea onto everything:

Setting classes by academic capability helps everyone to learn to the best of their ability? Screw that! That's discriminatory! Stick the cretins in with the people who have a high capacity for learning! Oh, what's this? Now the class is split straight down the middle, with half learning at a rate far too slow for them and the other half learning at a rate far too high for them? Well at least no-one's feeling excluded.

What's this? Students are assaulting teachers at a rate of 9000 assaults per year (source: On The Edge p19), with high levels of under-reported crime? Oh, and if the teacher uses self-defence, or if the teacher physically separates a pair of fighting students they can (and are, same source) be jailed? Ah well, at least it proves that we don't agree with corporal punishment.

Don't even get me started on how badly Labour wrecked the economy, or how they totally destroyed the police force. Suffice it to say, the time I spent at one of our lovely little inner-city comps was the most depressing, violent, and utterly worthless seven years of my life. Labour definitely isn't good for state education - quite the opposite.

Case in point: at my state comprehensive I achieved BCCD grades at A-Level. When I left and studied on my own I achieved AAAC... In dramatically harder subjects.

If you want to see gangs stabbing one another, then go to a comprehensive. If you want to learn absolutely nothing, whilst watching the poor old teacher trying to play a role that largely consists of being a jail warden, then go to a comprehensive. If you are fascinated by knives and guns, then go to a comprehensive. But don't go to a comprehensive if you actually want an education, and don't start prattling on about how the Labour government provides a great education for those too poor for private school.

Keep in mind here, that I'm not saying the Tories are any better - they aren't - I'm saying that Labour is abysmal and your claims are wrong. Regardless how much money they pump into the system, they still don't manage to produce anything semi-decent for that investment.

EDIT:

What is this I don't even...

Please, for the love of God, tell me that you aren't one of those people who think the riots were political? You can't possibly think that if you attended a normal city comprehensive, so you're either being dishonest in your implications about your educational background, or dishonest in your raising of that incident.

The riots were caused by the fact that chavs know, thanks to over a decade of having no consequences for any of their behaviour, that they can get away with doing whatever they want. They smashed stuff up and stole stuff because it's fun to smash things up and steal things. Why did one of them attack another with a drill in my school? Because it's fun, and there are no consequences. Why did one of them attack another with a knife in my school? Because it's fun, and there are no consequences. Seeing a pattern here yet?

If you've lived your whole life seeing that no-one in your community has a (legal) job, any form of responsibility, even the most basic form of care and appreciation for their kids or community, with absolutely no meaningful consequences, then of course you're going to become a disgusting little amoral chav.

But I'm just wasting my time here: if I even get a reply then it'll just be full of New Left weasel words and obfuscations. You either haven't directly experienced any of the cultures you're talking about for any length of time, or you're so immersed in them that you can't see why they're wrong.

So you draw on one word out of a list of Tory fails and write an essay...and for that reason alone I won't waste my time reading it. Thanks for taking the time to write me a mini book though <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/> byee

Labour tried to make university accessible to everyone

</quote>

1) 50% is not "everyone".

2) It is accessible to everyone provided they work hard enough.

It's not just a case of "working hard" - they also have to be initially bright enough, and also have the opportunity to better themselves up to university standard.

A pedantic point, I know, but an important one nevertheless.
