Hey guys, I am so torn up over my daughters changes.....I am dealing with such a negative, angry person now, she's just not the same.

I have done my best to allow her to develop peer interactions with kids at school, sports and in the neighborhood. We've adjusted our work schedules to allow for more family time, etc.

This whole situation is breaking my heart. Before we moved my daughter was a typical 9 year old, happy, carefree, sometimes she got an attitude when things didn't go her way and even the occassional sibling rivalry.

Now, she's just plain out rude, disrespectful, unappreciative, unhelpful, etc, etc. This is not my daughter!! She never is tolerant of her sister, she's physically hurt her sister, she's postured aggressively at me, even grabbing my wrist in her bedroom and getting in my face screaming at me.

Theres been so much she's gone through and she's not opened up to the therapist about anything, she's pretending that she's great in front of her and I know she's not....uggg....

i know this is not her Dads fault but all of these changes,us moving, Dad got married, had a new kid with his new wife, they put her down in the basement in a roughed in bedroom with no heat, etc. just because she complained about sharing a room, now she feels detached and unimportant over there but she won't tell them that, she feels like we never do anything fun anymore. Its hard to explain that VA is not FL, we don't live 20 min from the beach, and hour from orlando, bush gardens, etc. anymore. We have the river and washington DC in our backyard now. I think she is depressed...I don't know ugg!! but the therapist can't tell cause she doesn't talk! grrrr

what the heck do I do? I can't let her continue to do everything she wants when she is acting this way. <img src="/images/smilies/frown.gif"/>

I can hear the desperation in your words. It's obvious that you love your daughter and want what's best. I wish that I had advice, but I can only tell you what I did when I went through the bad years with my son. Whenever he acted out with someone new I would say, congratulations, he trusts you. So, it sounds like she is saving all her anger and pain for you because she trusts that you will be with her no matter what. When my son would do things that were almost unbearable, I would (when I could get past my own fury) say, "No matter what you do, I will love you. I can't stop loving you, even if I wanted to. You are part of me and always will be." Or words to that effect. He was testing me constantly, still does sometimes, to see whether he could force me to hate him. I know that his situation is not the same as your daughter's; all I can tell you is what I learned from my experience. Also, about opening up to the therapist: that took a REALLY long time. At an hour a week, it's hard for a kid to build that trust. We stuck it out, though, and it eventually worked. I said on another post, recently, that I wish the transporters from Star Trek were real. Then, when you are going through the really rough spots, a parent or parents who KNOW what you're going through could beam in to help. A network of parents willing to help. Wouldn't that be great? In the meantime, I'll just keep you in my heart and mind and hope that will help in some small measure.
