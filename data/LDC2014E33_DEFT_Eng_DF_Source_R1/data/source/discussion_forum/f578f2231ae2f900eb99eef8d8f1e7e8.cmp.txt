Verbal diarrhea isn't much help. Why not tell us why you disagree with Kurt instead?

Here's the rest of what he wrote, to give you a start:

<quote>
This is why a candidate like Newt can use racially coded language in attacking the president and pay no penalty. In essence, the Republican Party base sees America as heading for a race war, in which whites will have to coalesce around the GOP to defend the conservative cultural and political values that existed under the pre-1960s, white-supremacist polity.

It's a pretty dismal vision for America. Rather than reaching out to black and Latino voters, the GOP is following a strategy that's totally dependent on polarizing the country into two parties, a conservative, backwards looking party for whites only, and a liberal, Democratic party for "everyone else".

That strategy might work for a while. But as the older, white, conservative population declines, it can only cling to power by using more and more blatant tricks to keep its opponents from voting. Ultimately, the path the Republican Party is following will lead to the apartheidization of America.

We discussed how in Florida, Jeb Bush (GOP) was actually making an effort to reach out to Latinos. This is in contrast to what Republican candidates were doing in SC, and Bush knew it. That's why he spoke up: he wants his party to prevail, not go down the path Kurt described.

What else do you have to say about the quoted material? You can't persuade people unless you offer an alternative or at least explain why the given viewpoint is in error. "Verbal diarrhea" won't change anyone's mind.

I'm basically asking you the same thing C2 asked Meade, who has conveniently stepped out for the duration.

Thank you Sno.

That seems a bit vitriolic to me. Conjures up images of Charlie Manson and Helter Skelter. I don't like it because it doesn't lead to a thoughtful discussion.

Heck take out the vitriol and I'm inclined to agree with much of what Kurt said. I do think Republicans have less traction with SC non-whites because their way (more self-reliance) will take longer. Who wants to hear that when you've grown up in an entitlement culture?

I do like to see guys like Jeb Bush realizing they need to address it.

What does a conservative believe?
By SHELBY STEELE | February 2, 2012 |I believe that freedom of the individual — as opposed to good works or “social justice” — is by far the highest goal any society can strive for. I became a conservative precisely to deal with my fate as a black American born into a segregated society. Racism had deprived me of individual freedom as I grew up in segregated America. But then, as segregation faded, there followed a flood of good works intended to make up for the past: school busing; welfare that asked nothing of its beneficiaries; racial preferences at universities that did not discriminate; and amorphous, do-good concepts like “diversity” that are merely a license to shallow social engineering — to arranging an optics of race and gender harmony.
The problem with all these liberal good works is that they associate blackness with permanent inferiority. They don’t really believe in the fundamental human equality of the people they claim to help. They want to be valued for their good intentions, never for their effectiveness in uplift. I grew to hate these programs and policies because they not only believed in my inferiority more than my capacity for excellence but also encouraged me to use black weakness — the inferiority imposed by four centuries of brutal oppression — as leverage and entitlement in the larger society.
Modern liberalism seduces blacks with an idea of justice into an investment in our own historically imposed inferiority, as though it were a kind of talent. Only conservatism gave me a shot at true human equality. Possibly the greatest irony in American political culture is that conservatism — even today — is stigmatized as oppressive to minorities when, in fact, it is literally our only road ahead. We already have equality under the law. Only contemporary conservatism — which simply wants fairness by individuals rather than by groups — offers us the chance for true dignity, for freedom from both bigotry and paternalism.
And let there be no confusion: history has escalated the terms of equality from civil rights to merit. Today an equality of merit is expected to match the equality of rights. You are competitive by merit with others or you are not. Today the great weapon of equality is the pursuit of excellence.
I became conservative when I realized that the era of protest was over. We blacks won everything we could win through protest — but it was an idea of what others must do for us, of how others must be moral and tolerant. Conservatism is the road ahead because it is an idea of what we can do for ourselves.
