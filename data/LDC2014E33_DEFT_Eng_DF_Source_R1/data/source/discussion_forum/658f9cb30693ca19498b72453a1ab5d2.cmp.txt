Personally, I didnt' give a crap about the mosque. But I can understand how some might have found it insensitive. But I don't see how finding it insensitive constitutes holding those behind it accountable for 9/11.

How is it insensitive if the mosque has nothing to do with the 9/11 terrorists?

</quote>

As far as I can tell it would mean that people who had nothing to do with 9/11 were doing a victory dance for something that they had nothing to do with.

</quote>

Yup.

And I agree that it's a pretty silly accusation, but believing this and also believing that crime begins and ends with those who commit them is not contradictory or hypocritical, as the OP implies.

I see another wingnut is too scared to defend his own words

Why do wingnuts always run when challenged?

Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were being serious.

I did in fact laugh out loud when I read your post.

The answer seems obvious to me, but let me give you an analogy that might help you out...

How would it be insensitive for me to call a black man a nigger if I had nothing to do with slavery?

Suss that out and maybe you'll get it.

Last time I went by the area, the mosque wasn't calling black people "nigger". Please explain how it is insensitive to build a mosque on the former site of the Sacred Burlington Coat Factory

I can't explain why something that doesn't offend me is offensive. But neither you nor I get to tell other people what they are allowed to find offensive. Again, the point I'm trying to make is that being offended by the mosque and also believing crime begins and ends with the criminals who commit them is not contradictory or hypocritical, no matter how much you and geaux want to pretend that it is.

Gee, earlier you said that building the mosque is insensitive and that the reason was obvious and simple. Now, it's suddenly impossible for you to explain why it's insensitive <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Keep dancing

Those responsible for 9/11 were Muslim

Those who want to build a mosque are Muslim

Some view this as insensitive. That much seems obvious, you hacktard. It's the WHY that I can't explain.

But you've clearly demonstrated that you are incapable of objectivity and it's been duly noted. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/thup.gif"/>

Thanks for showing your hand so easily...
