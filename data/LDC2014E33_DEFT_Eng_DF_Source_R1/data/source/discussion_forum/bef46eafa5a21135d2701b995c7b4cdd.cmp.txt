@William,

Please give me some time to try to grasp it better than in just one sitting. I do, off the top of my head see a few bits of data which go against what has been well shown by neuroscientific and psychological studies, but there may be no real need to go into that. I may not be able to get back on line later tonight, so it may well have to wait until tomorrow.

Thanks for the input, and the compliments (I hope I can live up to them). KJ

@William,

The whole man over women thing I always thought had it's origins from the hunter gatherer era, and then sort of died out with the socialist era, where women no longer relied on men for survival of themselves and their children, rather the state.

Of course the big time capitalists still hold on to, emphasize, and promote it to keep their sink or swim lifestyle a float.

IMO, if you want to find someone who loves you for you and not just your money or ability to support, hook up in a socialist country.

The only big thing that concerns me over the differences is the emotional differences, which in my opinion are more learned as parents reward emotionalism with girls with comfort, and reward boys with emotionalism with scorn and discipline.

I think this hinders the ability for the sexes to relate to each other and creates the impression of weakness in women. IMO, boys need to be allowed a wee bit more to cry and express their emotions and girls need to not be allowed to as much as children, in other words, they should be treated equally in this arena, and encouraged to express positive emotions and discouraged from negative ones.

@William,

Please do forgive the time it has taken to get back here. I had to really throw some of it around a bit to see what associations may come out of it, and to grasp those ( [and I have suddenly had a surge of workload increase ).

I agree that we can focus on just the H. sapien, the humanbeing, but also realize that by doing such, we will not be cutting the line of continuum with all other life forms that are, and have been. By focusing on the H. sapien, for example, we will not be giving consideration to the H. neandertahlensis, H. heidelbeergensis, H. erectus, H. rudolfensis, P. robustus, and so on, or, even, the H. sapiens idaltu (which is very intermmediate in build--globular braincase) We would not be focusing on the Great Apes, even our very near relatives the chimpanzees (including the bonobo), regardless of the overlap in genetic material we share. So, while we do this, we should, nevertheless, keep that in mind all along.

As far as I can tell, and I could be misreading a bit, I'll grant, it does appear as though further information could be useful on understanding the general and most common referent for the word memory. Firstly, there are a number of memory types; and I am not talking about simply implicit and explicit, episodic, emotional, and so on, but memories that have been shown to be there in brains but which do not reach consciousness level-- we don't know of them subjectively. These matters, however, I do feel (and reason) would have to come little by little on the other threads which I am also slowly posting on, rather than on this one.

And with that...time is up. I'll be back, in due time. KJ

@William,

William, I can't help noticing the generalizing and assumptions in your OP. I can see your views on one hand and understand where they may come from culturally, but as a feminist I disagree with the 51/49 partnership idea of yours. What are your reasons for suggesting that a male's view should be accepted in a stalemate scenario by default? Also, what are your thoughts on femininity and why that is a more desirable quality than feminism? What is your understanding of feminism? Just inviting friendly discussion. (If you happened to already answered these, forgive me, I'm still reading through the thread. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"/> )
