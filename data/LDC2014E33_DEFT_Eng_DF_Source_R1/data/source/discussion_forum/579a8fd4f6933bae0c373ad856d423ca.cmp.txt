Congratulations. You won a debate with an anonymous poster on the internet.

Yet you are please as punch that you have no idea that he answered the question.

An example of someone who prefers to be labelled a winner over knowing the truth.

FYI...a simple google search will give you dozens of links to his COMPLETE answer.

But, of course, you prefer only knowing what your media wants you to know....so you wont conduct that search.

Live in ignorance.....enjoy.

you did not answer my question....

They interviewed Newts ex wife right before a primary.

They interviewed people that worked for companies once owned by Bain.

Who from Obamas past did they interview?

</quote>

Reverend Wright...any other assumptions?

</quote>

See how that works?

Exactly...Reverend Wright.

Obama claimed to know nothing about his sentiments.

Then he claimed he did but paid no mind.

So one answer was a lie...so we know he, like all politicians, will lie for political expediency.....

So exactly who did they interview to find out the truth?

You seem content with the truth....you know...."I didnt know of them....oh yeah...he was my mentor...so yes...I knew of them....but I never really paid attention..."

And you were just fine with that.

And to you? The media did a great job.

</quote>

First you complain they didnt interview anyone from his past. Since you are wrong Now you are going back to the "they didnt ask the question I wanted them too sooo that means..."

Moving those goalposts pretty fast there skippy <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/> But in order to be a victim you have to see attacks from everywhere.

No way the "media" is bag for ANY republican. Whatever they do in the primaries for or against a republican is what they think will be best for the democrats.

Of COURSE the media is in the bag for Gingrich. They would LOVE to see him represent the GOP. Easy target, lots of baggage, a verbal gaffe just waiting to happen. The only thing better than Gingrich would be Gingrich/Palin. Holy crap, they'd think they had died and gone to heaven.
