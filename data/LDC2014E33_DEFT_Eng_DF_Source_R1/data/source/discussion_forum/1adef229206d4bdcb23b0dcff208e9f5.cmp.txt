President Bush expanded the federal budget by a historic $700 billion through 2008. President Obama would add another $1 trillion.

President Bush began a string of expensive finan*cial bailouts. President Obama is accelerating that course.

President Bush created a Medicare drug entitle*ment that will cost an estimated $800 billion in its first decade. President Obama has proposed a $634 billion down payment on a new govern*ment health care fund.

President Bush increased federal education spending 58 percent faster than inflation. Presi*dent Obama would double it.

President Bush became the first President to spend 3 percent of GDP on federal antipoverty programs. President Obama has already in*creased this spending by 20 percent.

President Bush tilted the income tax burden more toward upper-income taxpayers. President Obama would continue that trend.

President Bush presided over a $2.5 trillion increase in the public debt through 2008. Setting aside 2009 (for which Presidents Bush and Obama share responsibility for an additional $2.6 trillion in public debt), President Obamas budget would add $4.9 trillion in public debt from the beginning of 2010 through 2016.

As to... "Why didn't we hear about the deficit during the Bush administration?"

Answer - You didn't read the NYT or WaPo or the internet? You did not watch CNN or FOX News? In other words, what's this "we" stuff kemosabe?

Sorry you can add the debt from '09 to BUSH'S total since the budgert ending Oct '09 was passed by BUSH!!!! Do you understand how that works?

Just another bit of that graph thats false.

OK that explains one more trillion of Bush's addition to the national debt. There's still another 3 trillion not showing on that graph.

It's just a false graph.

why do you think bush's poll numbers were in the 30's, and bad through most of his second term given the fact that we are pretty much a 50/50 nation. I'll help, it's because right of center people were angry about bush's spending.
