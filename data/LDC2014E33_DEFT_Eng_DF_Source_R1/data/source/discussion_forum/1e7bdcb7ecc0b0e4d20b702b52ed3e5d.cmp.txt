Where's YOUR criticism of Shrub twinkle toes?

</quote>

I've criticized him many times, for not wielding his veto pen nearly enough, for not fighting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan aggressively enough, and for spending money like a drunken Democrat.

Where's your criticism of SCOAMF?

</quote>

I was pretty pissed he didn't put up Public Option, he didn't fight hard enough for Health Care Reform. I think he gave and gives the Republicans too much leeway, in other words he doesn't fight then nearly enough. He agrees with them too much. He didn't shut down gitmo. However, I temper that with the realization that said Republicans are fighting him tooth and nail on everything.

You praise him with faint damns. "He isn't far moonbat left enough!!" <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

You just make sure you keep blaming Republicans. Don't hold Dear Reader accountable for anything.
