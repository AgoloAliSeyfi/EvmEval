And if I said I wanted to tax aerospace companies in Washington state that gross over $10 billion a year, that wouldn't be the same thing as creating a tax on Boeing Aerospace, would it?

</quote>

Not if Boeing opts to make pencil erasers instead....or have a bad year and gross less than 10 billion a year.

I believe THAT is the point RDD is making.

The tax wouldnt be on Boeing...it would be on any company that fits the criteria.

Don't be stupid. Of course it's a tax on Beoing. A federal court ruled exactly that when the state of Washington tried to impose exactly such a tax.

That's like saying I don't have to pay income tax if I want to starve in some cave.

That has to be one of the most idiotic arguments ever posted on this board.

NOT IF BOEING OPTS TO CHANGE THEIR BUSINESS MODEL and no longer be in the aerospace industry.

Regarding the proposed million dollar earner tax
A million dollar earner is taxed as a million dollar earner ONLY when he has an income of a million dollars or more. The following year he makes only 900K? He ios no longer being taxed as one earning a million bucks.

Now...I agree with your senmtiments about a tax on those earning a million bucks or more...

But I cant figure out why you cant see the point RDD and I are making.

He doesn't get it, he won't ever get it. Apparently it's too tough of a concept.

</quote>

You're the one who doesn't get it. The fact that you use some criteria to identify people to tax other than identifying them by name doesn't mean you aren't discriminating against them by name.

I already posted you an example that proves my point.

You're mad, aren't you?

So, the left wants to redistribute wealth with taxation and that isn't an attempt to legislate some equality in wealth, right?

</quote>

Not mad at all. You're just wrong. No one wants to make us "all the same". That's just your typical brainwashed bullshit that I hear all the time from the right. You ask ANY progressive on here that same question and I doubt you'd even get a positive response from ONE of them.

No one said the rich can't be so. That's just Rush Beckbaugh talking to your ignorant ass.

</quote>

And that's always the lefts excuse for denying what they really are. Believe it or night most people on the right don't get weekly marching orders from Beck or Limbaugh. Do you see me accusing you of being a Michael Moore or Paul Krugman parrott?

The left wants equal outcomes. How do I know that? Look at the policies they push for. Giving more and more to the poor and taking more and more from the rich. Are you really trying to deny that? How can such policies result in anything but an equally mediocre society? Freedom and safety are opposites where government is concerned. The more you you gain of one the more you lose of the other and the simple fact is liberals value security more than freedom. We can all strive for risk free lives, but keep in mind that is going to curtail the ability of anyone person to succeed much beyond another and believe it or not there are benefits to members of society defining and achieving measures of success as defined by themselves rather than government.

3% that was cut in the beginning of the Bush Presidency was paid for by loans from China. Asking the Rich to return to that sustainable level is hardly asking for more and more is it?
