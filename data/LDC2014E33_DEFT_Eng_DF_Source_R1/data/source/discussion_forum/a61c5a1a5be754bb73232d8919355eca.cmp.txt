This is exactly what I'm talking about when I speak of the growing disconnect between the Military and the Civilian sector, you obviously never served a damn day in your life. VA Benefits are a case by case basis and that amount is different for everyone depending on their disabilities, and they are not hand outs you stupid fuck.

yeah right. every bum I know has told me they had their discharge upgraded and they get VA benefits.

every time I've volunteered at some homeless shelter or food place some VA guy shows up and tries to sign up everyone.

I've been told how to screw the VA, get benefits and live off the system

wake the fuck up turd boy. I know people who ran the VA and have to keep my mouth shut around them, because like you they are all blind

So if these people are in the homeless shelter how in the fuck are they using their VA Benefits for mortages and car payments you boot licking faggot? if anything it sounds like their benefits need an upgrade. Also you keeping your mouth shut around the guys who run the VA shows how much of a spineless little pussy ass bitch you are.

You are the kind of stupid that there is no coming back from. VA benefits aren't a hand out, they are not welfare, they are earned from time in combat and time in service. You know, fight for the country boom truck hit by an ied wow 200 a month few more times I might have a decent check on my hand.

before 911 -

most every vet I know never saw a day of combat in their lives.

most every vet I met over a certain age, went into the military as a last resort...they were criminals and bums. they got paid and became criminals and bums on leaving military.

then some VA counselor shows up and tells people how to scam the system. just ask any honest vet. It's an open secret

And to think of the sacrifices you, me, HG, and our families endured...

Pathetic - and totally unpatriotic.

To alot of people the service that we gave was no different than working as a school bus driver or as a cashier at Home Depot.

We are wasting our time with that ass hat Dante, to her VA benefits and disability are one in the same as food stamps, Welfare checks and Cash aid.
