Clearly we need the poor to have money in their pockets so they can buy our goods and services.

And the rich use them to build their empires.

When did a poor person ever create a job? Last time he had money in his pockets. Before Bush took office. That's when.

In frequent threads here the brain-dead leftists moan about how the "idle rich" (like there is such a thing) don't deserve their money. But look at the other side. The poor in this country enjoy a lifestyle envied by even middle class people in most of the world. What have they done to deserve this? The idlest of the idle rich invest money and help other hard working people get ahead. The poor simply absorb tax payer funding and have babies.

How dare you. Most of the poor have already contributed to the system and what they get they have earned. There are some who are poor because of no fault of there own and because of corrupt government has mis managed there tax money. GOD said take care of poor and if you were any kind of christian you would not bitch about the little the poor do get. Beware that you may be standing now but could fall at any minute?

New International Version (Â©1984)
So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall!

Warning GOD gave to Isreal before their fall.

How would you solve the debt problem?

Allowing corporations and the rich to not pay their fair share certainly isn't the way. Or lying us into the Iraq war and paying for it with borrowed money.

And why when they were in power did the GOP pass tax breaks for companies sending jobs overseas? Is it because our government now works for the corporations instead of the people? Citizens United would suggest so.

The GOP are only cutting spending on things that help the poor and middle class. Drop in the bucket but making America a much worse place than it was before. Eliminating safety nets during a time when you caused a great recession? And the rich have never been richer? And you think they need more tax breaks?

History repeats itself. This happned in 1948 and before the Great Recession. And most Americans don't realize they are brainwashed through Fox and Rush and Drudge. The media has been taken over but they've brainwashed you for 30 years by telling you its the liberal media. Its only as liberal as they want it to be.

A lot of straw in that rant.

How would I solve the problem? Too many to list really but we start with restructure of government. That alone covers up to 400 billion a year in redundant services.

Now as far as other cuts. Lets remeber our broke entitlement system, SS is broke. Democrats made it law to put this money into the general fund and that SS be made a budget item.

Should I thank you or kick you?

</quote>

They broke SS. It wasn't broken before they purposely broke it. And now they want to end it or privatize it? How about put it back to what it was before. Didn't Bush tap into SS to pay for the Bush tax cuts? End the Bush tax cuts and first order is to put all that money back into SS where they found it.

Clinton tapped into it too. Lock box. Remember that discussion in 1999? LOL.

</quote>

Can you put the kool-aid down for a few minutes.

That became law in 69. Democrats have sold spending the money and here you are defending. Here is fact you can not dispute. If SS had been reformed and we were allowed to invest that ten percent. There would be money in that fund today. You can not say that with government.

What frightens you about investing ten percent of your money?

Really?

Well, in that case ask your congresscritter to provide you <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/1997-09-24/politics/irs.hearing_1_irs-abuses-irs-agent-jennifer-long-irs-management?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS">transcripts of the 1997 Senate hearings</a> which amply demonstrated that the gestapo agency known as the IRS is judge, jury and executioner.
