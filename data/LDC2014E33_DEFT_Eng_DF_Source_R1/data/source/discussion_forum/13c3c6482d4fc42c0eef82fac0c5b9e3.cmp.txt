Stop getting your info from Fox.

You guys talk about class warfare, I think the right is more involved in class warfare than anyone else. The problem is, you are going after people just like you.

Dont be dim.

I listen to what they say on camera, on msnbc, abc and fox.

They are all a bunch of spoiled kids, or whiny adults that want other people to take care of them.

No genius, THEY WANT MORE JOBS TO BE AVAILABLE....THEY WANT THE RAT BASTARDS ON WALL ST. AND THEIR BANKING BUDDIES TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE CRIMES AGAINST SOCIETY (THEFT), AND THEY WANT TO STOP BEING USED BY THE WEALTHY TO PAY FOR THEIR LARGESSE AND ERRORS I.E., UNION BUSTING, LOPSIDED TAX BREAKS AND LOOPHOLES.

I got that from listening to MSNBC, ABC, NPR, WBAI.....seems YOU need to get your head out of Limbaugh's fat ass, clean out your ears, and EXPAND YOUR COGNITIVE REASONING AND LISTENING SKILLS.

Wow, if you're attempting to insult someone, try improving your spelling skills for a better impact.

Are you truly this ignorant of what went on in the last 12 years, or are you just some insipidly stubborn neocon/teabagger hack?

Stop, take your two thumbs out of your ass and THINK! Why was the Wall St./banker bailouts necessary? Then do some honest research and see when all this crap started (hint: 8 years of GW Bush).

But I suspect you're just some dumb kid who'll repeat his neocon/teabagger nonsense ad nauseum while refusing to look at any facts that will contradict your beliefs. Carry on.
