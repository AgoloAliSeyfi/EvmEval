Don't deal well with the truth, huh? You state, without support, as a categorical thesis from authority, that most white people believe in white supremacy, and that this is evident from the history of European colonization and exploitation. When it is shown that the thesis is not supported by the historical record, you now start ranting about intent v. effect. How does that support your shakey thesis about a pervasive belief in white supremacy? Oh... it doesn't? I see, we've change the direction of debate because the other was fruitless? Just wanna keep up with the changes here...

Nah, it comes down to pure anthropology and genetics. Humans are naturally prone to hate others who are different from them. That is why we form peer groups, polarized societies, bad politicians, and why we go to war. The EFFECT, to use your caps, is the same anywhere people are, or feel, oppressed.

Noah,

No one is disagreeing that the "social economic gaps between blacks and whites.... are due to... slavery, colonization, Jim Crow exploitation" etc. etc. etc.

But you are making a very big leap when you say "Most whites are racist" and an even bigger leap when you say "whites believe in white supremacy".

When you accused Craven and others of latent white supremacy just because he disagrees with you, you crossed the line into complete blind absurdity.

You've have got a lot of pent up anger inside.

Most of us of all races are just trying to live a good life now. I like the fact that I have good friends I can trust of many races, and if someone treats me decently, the color of her skin doesn't matter at all.

Of course broad social issue do matter. Trying to get underrepresented groups (be they Black, Latino or poor) is important goal that I (and I suspect most of us here) support.

But what is this anger going to get you.

I am aware of the fact that some of my ancestors oppressed some of my other ancestors. But so what.

I am worried about living a decent life and teaching my children to do the same. Unless you are personally 400 years old and experienced all of this oppression, I would suggest you do the same.

Setanta, Wrong, what I proposed is that the doctrine of white supremacy existed in the past as so-called white scientist and scholars propagated this belief as science. This is not just a PAST phenomenon either, just go to your local bookstore and pick up a copy of “The Bell Curve”. However, I digress. I never stated that the doctrine of what supremacy was at the root of cause of slavery. Long ago I stated that ECONOMICS was the root cause of black exploitation and that black inferiority was simply the pretext or rationalization that needed to be provided to a religious society. Thus, blacks were characterized as savages and uncivilized and that exposure to whites, even as slaves, would be to the benefit of blacks.

I don't think anyone disagreed that economics was the root of black exploitation there, Noah. It was many other portions of your thesis that were in question.

The bottom-line, that all of you keep filibustering, is the notion that if people are poor, relative to others, not due to external factors, then why are they poor? If blacks are not poorer than whites due to external factors, then why are they poorer than whites? This is not rocket science. Heck, it is not even primary school arithmetic. To suggest that blacks are not poor due to external factors leaves black disproportionate poverty to be the result of internal factors, which could only mean that blacks are inferior. Thus, I have a right and logical validity to say that people who assume the internal as causing disproportionate black poverty are racist. You cannot speak for these other people Mr. Brown. The fact that you made the statement acknowledging the external does not mean that you can and do speak for the others. They could easily do as you have done, but they are not……you should wonder what is creating their inertia to go on record and stop trying to blast me for pointing out the obvious.
