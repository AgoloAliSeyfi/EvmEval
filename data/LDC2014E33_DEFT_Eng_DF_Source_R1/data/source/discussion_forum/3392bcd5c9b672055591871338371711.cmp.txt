I don't know how to go about seeking vengence on BP for desecration of the Gulf. I am beside myself. My best friend #3 was going to St. George Island with her family for Mother's Day this weekend. But they will probably cancel because the oil slick will have reached those sugary sand beaches by then.

About a month after the ocean's shores have been befouled, the inland waterways will begin showing the devasation. The Wakulla River, where my kidlet taught me to canoe. The St. John's River, where we hung out in a biker bar in St. Mark's on Fridays after work, eating broiled shrimp and drinking cheap beer, just watching the Earth do it's thing.

Eventually the oil will travel the underground and above-ground aquifer to every Florida body of water, including the beleagered Everglades...a natural phenomena unparrelled on Planet Earth and precious not only to Florida, but to the entire Planet for the role it plays in our wildlife, ecosystem and so on.

Death would not be too severe a punishment for BP's CEO, as I see it.

Don't buy BP gasoline!

Try to boycott, especially if you are purchasing large quantities for a commercial trucking, farming or airline business.

I welcome any additional ideas on how to afflict BP.

I am just heart broken. I cannot tell you what this preventable insult to the Earth will be like for all of Florida, and beyond.

Works for me, let the boycott begin.

I believe it is referred to as 'trial by television'. There is no actual, CREDIBLE report that confirms any one company is responsible.

But, we can't let that get in the way of moronic whining and hysterical ranting.

What complete fuckwhitery. There is OIL in the GULF. Case closed, you knucklebrains.

ZERO tolerance for spillage means NONE AT ALL. The Strict Liability standard applies. There is OIL, ergo, BP is guilty.

Put down your twitter-vibes and stop obessing about Linsay Lohan's vagina shots. Try reading a fucking newspaper, you 'net parrots.

*Note to self: Call Mom and thank her for teaching me the ability to think for myself.*

BP's Oil, Transoceans platform, US Governments consent, the states bent over backwards to help BP, each and every American uses the products of the oil industry and refuse to cut their consumption.

Fuck you. We are all responsible, including those who are probably going to lose their livelihoods. Idiot.

Culpability may lie elsewhere, you baggy cunt. But it is gonna to lie FIRST on BP's executives.

I'm not surprised you need to call your Mommy. Tell her someone is being mean to you, and remember, you nasty case of cunt-grease, that Sunday is Mother's Day.

Mebbe she can teach you some fucking manners too, on a remedial ed program.

Some issues are more important than your narcissistic, neurotic need to attempt to goad me, you snail slime trail-blazer, California Girl.

You are a fine one to lecture on manners, you fucking freak.

I prefer to judge on facts, not hysterical whining and the bullshit in the media. It's not my fault you're stupid so name-calling won't change the fact. You're a ranting idiot and I am not. Live with it.

However, your posts do disprove one old wife's tale "With age comes wisdom".... clearly not.
