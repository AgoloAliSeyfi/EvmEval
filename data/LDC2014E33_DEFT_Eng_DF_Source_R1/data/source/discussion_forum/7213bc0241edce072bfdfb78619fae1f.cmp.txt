um...newt played this up because SC is a very right leaning state who already thinks the media is far left. Newt basically jerked over all their faces and the people wanted more of it. You can see it in this thread as well.

In the end the story is this. Newt played it up to the base, they loved it, but he still dodged the question. You can't take one debate in a primary and use it for the rest of the race. If he were to win it would be a different ballgame, so his answer would have to be different.

Or

He could answer it the same and risk loosing the middle more moderate Indies and GOP...

Another one who decided to deabte something he knows nothing about.

Obviously, you didnt watch the debate.

i watched the clip of it, he didnt answer it. he whined about the media and how disgusting it was for them to ask such a question.

nice try..... Like i said its rather meaningless anyways. Newt is a hypocrite when it comes to marriage so his opinions on it are meaningless.

Hey folks...

HERE IT IS....

PLASMABALL THINKS IT IS OK TO DEBATE SOMETHING BASED ON A SNIPPET...A CLIP OF WHAT HIS MEDIA DEEMED WAS WORTHY OF HIS KNOWING.

I mean...you actually said he never answered the question.

That is completely false.....he answered it completely.

We do it all the time here...I watched the whole clip of him not really answering it, and giving King shit for it.

If there was more, feel free to provide said evidence and we can go from thier.

He didnt answer the question, he just blasted King and the media ( which was his answer). Im not sure where you are going with this and how you are reading my " he didnt answer the question".

He answered it with a dodge.

You want to be the next one bitch-slapped by Newt - ?

Facts are sometimes difficult to accept aren't they?

If the media is in the bag for Newt, then it is possible that CNN set up the question so Newt can answer in a forcible way. Forcible enough to send undecided republicans into his corner for the South Carolina primary.

I have called Newt a sabotuer for the Dem's, and the 'handling' of the debate by Newt appeared staged to me. If the liberal media was against Newt, they would have taken into account how Newt performed against the moderator in past debates. The moderators normally would not ask the question right off the bat(which King has done) but knife Newt through his opponents like in previous debates so that Newt could not answer directly.

All Newt did was verbally body-slam a liberal. That is how a Newt won S.C. In that case, Hannity should run for President!

What makes you think John King is a Liberal? Or were you not thinking?

</quote>

Oh my fault. It is better to say that Newt verbally body-slammed CNN, a media outlet held to be liberally biased by many republicans. That is how a Newt won S.C. In that case, Hannity should run for President!

Now is there a problem?

Just saying Diversion doesnt work anymore. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_shhh.gif"/>

My was not a diversion. Mine was a response to something someone had said that was inaccurate.

No one is saying the media does not report the facts equally.....they do.

But it is HOW they report them that makies it appear there is media bias.

With the GOP candidates...we hear the media say "Rommeys critics feel he has something to hide in regard to his tax returns"

With Obama....we heard..."It is not unusual for a candiate to not want to release his college transcripts...some do, some dont."

Why didnt they say "Obamas critrics feel he may have something to hide regarding his college transcripts...afterall...it is true..his critics felt that

</quote>

Oh SHIT! Well, shit, why didnt you present that evidence earlier.

"Why didnt they say..." isnt proof of anything other than you thought up a question they didnt answer. Why didnt they ask Bush what happened to the millions that was lost in Iraq? Bias or they didnt ask?

Because I can think of questions they asked Obama and not Bush but what the fuck does that mean? Nothing.

</quote>

hey..

They intervvciewed Newts X right before a primary.

Did they interview any of Obamas former class mates?
Did they interview any of Obamas parishoners at Wrights church?
Did they interview anyne part of the Resko company?

Heck...I got a question....who did they interview to dig up any dirt that may be out there about Obama?

Who from his past did they intertview?
