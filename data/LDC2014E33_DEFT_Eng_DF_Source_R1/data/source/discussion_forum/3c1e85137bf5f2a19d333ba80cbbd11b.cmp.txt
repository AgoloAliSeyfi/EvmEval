According to the container experiment it is easy to calculate its on GF to 104 µGal (not 104 mGal)

Show your calculation.

A building like DOMUS I believe it own gravity is max 20 µGal, uncertainties is 8 µGal, + you have diffrent noise and several other uncertainties.

Show your calculation.

My friend I do not know the excact weight on that building
Do you.

This is what is predicted, (based on a assumed weight) and this is enough.

What assumed weight?
Show your calculation.

Look at your graph: Thank you for confirming that the Domus Vista experiment destroys "central gravity"!

Crap
Central measurements haven’t been executed.

Crap
Central measurements have been executed. The Domus Vista experiment is the experiment that you designed to test "central gravity". The fact that you designed and executed a experiment that does not support "central gravity" is the point.

So fare our understanding of gravity is; curvature of space.
Space is not just nothing. Space (must) have some kind of consistency / density.

Wrong.
Space is not "nothing" - it is the location of everything that there can be.
Only an idiot would say that is has a density. It is what is used to assign a volume and so density to something existing in space.
Alternately: If you are dumb enough to divide space by space (the "density" of space) then you always get the number 1.

So what causes gravity?
Gravity is caused by space-hungry matter wherever that matter is.. the rest is self explaining

In that case the experiment/measurement is completely controlled. We can eliminate a lot of G-noise We will know how much mass we have We will know that the mass is homogeneous. We can measure empty and full.

This is exactly described here :

So fare our understanding of gravity is; curvature of space.
Space is not just nothing. Space (must) have some kind of consistency / density.
Matter (the whole way towards a bodies centre) gradually consumes / contract space.
Hence, towards the centre of a body space is therefore gradually stretching until the centre is reach.
The cause of ADG is that matter consumes space, and hence that space between two bodies is stronger consumed, the result is bodies approach each other.
CENTRAL GRAVITY = understanding of the point mention above.

The line is always there, and it is possible to calculate.
Let say you put fifth 75 ton tanks in a ring, and measure ADG in the middle.
Now you will have opposition - a body in the centre will be attracted to in the 5 direction you have the tanks.
BUT in the middle of the ring of tanks a new central global gravitational (GF) field will weakly build up too, because even tough you have a ring of GF opposition, - you are also encircled / trapped central space, and hence affecting that area stronger.

Depending on how much you are encircling central space, (how many tanks you add to the ring) the global central GF will increase its strength.
This is shortly the secret of so called dark matter.
Its in fact only to understand the simple stretching nature of space/gravity.

Every stone on Earth contributes the Earths global GF, because every strong contributes to encircle the global central space, also even though the stone on short range is in opposition to the Earth GF.

This is why space must continue to stretch, in order to feed every stone and every atom with space, the whole way to the centre.

The experiments I linked to a few posts back rule out your theory by many, many, many sigma. To the extent that it's coherent or well-defined at all, it's totally inconsistent with just about every experiment ever done involving gravity.
