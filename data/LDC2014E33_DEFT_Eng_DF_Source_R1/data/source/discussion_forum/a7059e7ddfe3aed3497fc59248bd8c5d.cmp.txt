Space in the New York Times is a premium. I don't know why they'd devote it to this drudge that insults people's intelligence.

Well they devote space every week to David Brooks to write tripe like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/17/opinion/brooks-the-jeremy-lin-problem.html">this</a>.

Jeremy Lin is anomalous in all sorts of ways. Hes a Harvard grad in the N.B.A., an Asian-American man in professional sports. But we shouldnt neglect the biggest anomaly. Hes a religious person in professional sports.

He posted an opinion about their opinion piece?

My opinion:
It seems that the writer of the NYT op-ed would be OK with a fascist one-party state - just as long as they mostly did what he considered would make the nation great.

His main point seems to be that you can justify restricting democracy as there are objective "right" courses of action, which the powerful can perceive but the hoi-polloi are too ignorant to appreciate. (Consider me underwhelmed)

He also appears not to value highly:
a) the right to disagree with him (aka what right would he have to force his policies on an unwilling majority)
b) Cut down corruption and keep politicians responsive by the threat of not re-electing them.

Far from being dogma, point (b), when combined with transparency, is a very practical tool for encouraging good governance.
Point (a) may somewhat be considered dogma... but to ignore it would be to throw away vast amount of equal rights/equal protection ethics and law.

In my opinion, his opinion ain't worth the paper its written on. (And that's plenty bad as the NYT aint worth much at all).

Are you reading his mind?

You're trying to argue a strawman.

Supporters of the US (such as myself) will say: supporting unsavory regimes may or may not be justifiable, i.e. aid given to Stalin in WW2 - despite him being 'orrible - was arguably the lesser evil. When we view Chinese oppression (i.e. at Tiananmen Square) there doesn't seem to be, what we would consider, a moral justification for it (unlike some US actions/aid given during WW2 and the Cold War).

Note: that doesn't mean that the US always made the right decision, or that said support always turned out for the best, but it was intended to and often did. Unlike the Chinese regime - which appears to simply value the amoral pursuit and retention of power.

You seem to be using the exact same argument you say is strawman! The article itself does not say the Tiananmen Square atrocity was a good thing, what he argues is that it "was arguably the lesser evil", which is the exact same argument you use to say why you will support at times regimes that commit atrocities. As I said above it's an "the ends justify the means" argument.

And America's Tiananmen? The Bonus Army attacks? Was that necessary too?

None of which addresses the question, what exactly about the American form of government makes it proveably superior to what actually worked to get a billion people from the primitive conditions of the mid 20th century to China's status today?

And for me being a pragmatist this is very important to understand. I feel that my democracy (warts and all) is "better" but lets say look at something that I consider very important in my society i.e. social mobility. It is hard to argue with the empirical fact that the government in China over the last two decades has done more to enable and promote social mobility than has been possible under my preferred system over the same period. It may well be that my preference is fundamentally no different to the fact most Christians are born into Christian families.

The article is rather silly. It contends that democracy is young and that therefore history favors dictatorial systems of government. In doing so it ignores such facts as that the world changed in the past 100 years by more than it has changed in the previous 6000 - or indeed that the Chinese system it praises produced - just in the past 60 years - two major upheavals, one of which ended up as the greatest humanitarian disaster in history. It also ignores the fact that the rise of China coincides perfectly with their shift towards a more western model of economy.

It's patently ridiculous to claim their system is superior because it produced better economic results in the past three and a half years.

Well, for one it did get approximately a billion people from the primitive conditions of the mid 18th century to Western status today. That counts?
