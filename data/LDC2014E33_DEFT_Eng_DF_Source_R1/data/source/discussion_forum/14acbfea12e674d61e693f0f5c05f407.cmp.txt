now that can hurt them.

TR can be named as a "Renault Country". so if they can shift this by using their influence that would be quite a blow for France.

To my understanding Renault is closer to the current opposition in France.

I might be completely wrong on this, because it's based on perception who wins the bids for police cars according to the ruling parties there <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/cool.gif"/>

UPDATE: French Constitutional Council Says Armenia Genocide Law Unconstitutional

<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20120228-717139.html">UPDATE: French Constitutional Council Says Armenia Genocide Law Unconstitutional - WSJ.com</a>

(Updates with further comment from Turkey's government, further detail)

PARIS (Dow Jones)--France's top court on Tuesday ruled that a controversial law criminalizing denial of a disputed Armenian genocide in 1915 was unconstitutional, a ruling set to ease tensions between France and Turkey.

In a six-point ruling released on its website, France's Constitutional Council said the law which was passed by both houses of the French parliament violated freedom of speech. The council's decision definitively cancels the law in its current form and there is no possibility for an appeal.

The decision will likely be seen as a victory for Turkey, which reacted with fury when the bill was passed, unveiling a host of measures and threatening further action if the bill became law.

Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, hailed the ruling, telling reporters in Ankara that the news marked "an important contribution" to bilateral relations that stopped a gulf opening between the countries. The decision would set a precedent that could help stop other attempts to pass a similar bill, Davutoglu added.

However, shortly after the ruling, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said in a statement that he would order his government to redraft the bill and insisted denying the Armenian genocide should be punished.

The law had led to a clash between France and Turkey, which considers the Armenian killings part of the casualties related to the First World War and qualifying them as genocide an attack on the country. Following the parliamentary approval of the law, Turkey withdrew its ambassador from Paris and froze political and military relations between the two countries. In addition, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the bill was racist and Turkey might retaliate with economic sanctions against French companies.

Since both countries are North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, the dispute had rattled European Union diplomats who wanted to strengthen cooperation with Ankara amid Turkey's influential role in relation to Syria's uprising and Iran's nuclear program.

Turkey's government has repeatedly insisted that the bill is politically motivated, alleging Sarkozy was trying to win the votes of 500,000 ethnic Armenians in France ahead of presidential elections in two months.

Turkey contests the magnitude of the killings in 1915 and argues the genocide issue should be left to historians to decide, rather than legislated by governments.

Relations between the two countries were already frosty, in large part due to Sarkozy's vocal opposition to Turkey's bid to join the European Union.

Economists welcomed the move as a positive boost for bilateral business ties, which totaled $14.8 billion last year. Ozgur Altug, chief economist at BGC Capital Partners in Istanbul, said that the news was "definitely positive" for markets, stressing that France is Turkey's seventh largest trade partner, and third largest export partner, with a share of 5.2% in total exports.
