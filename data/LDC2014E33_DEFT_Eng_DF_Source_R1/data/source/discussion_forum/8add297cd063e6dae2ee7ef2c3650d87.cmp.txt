It's maybe the 'freedom' you'd feel if you **** deliberately yourself on a public bus. Whilst I'm sure there's some element of being impressed that you can throw off the social shackles and do what you damn well please, it quickly ends when you realise there are real consequences: in this example everyone thinking you're a nutter and realising that you have to get home with your underpants full of excrement.

Why ask for people's opinion then when somebody states that they hate it attack them saying they are getting all defensive?

It's like you're trolling your own thread, it's not really working.

Im asking what people thought of this theory, not expecting to play merry-go-round.

This quote by Friedrich Willhelm Nietzsche:

One lives for the day, lives very fast, very irresponsibly: precisely this is called &amp;quot;freedom&amp;quot;.

Many young people in today's society feel very oppressed, smothered by constant bombardment of advertising, the constant pressure to conform to the norms of capitalism and the hundrum existence of the 9-5. They are pressured by schools, colleges and universities to hear their calling...too soon! They are pressured by their peers to smoke, to look cool, to behave as they all do, to wear the same kind of clothes, to look the same, to have the best of material things, the pressure to get a job, to make further study, to rear a child, to work up the corporate ladder, to get &amp;quot;your own place&amp;quot;, to be seen with such and such, to think such and such, to say such and such, to look like such and such. How many black people do you think suffer from paranoia? Are black people paranoid? Why all the one-upmanship? Why are all the macho-posturing that black people do so very often, and now white people also do in their gangs?

A moment of freedom! On a horse you let go of the reigns, there is danger but is not registered, there is also freedom. In freedom you don't step outside of yourself and ask &amp;quot;Am I free now?&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Am I enjoying myself now&amp;quot;? In that moment you are free, riding freely both horse and rider. No constraints. No thought of danger or the consequences that you may fall and potentially harm yourself.

These riots were a moment of freedom. You can see it in the faces of the rioters (at least behind their masks). The kick against the daily grind is a moment of freedom from the daily grind (as in the drudgery of the norm, the hopelessness and the despair of day-to-day existence). Freedom is where there is a heightened sense of power. You heard the rioters say &amp;quot;because we can...&amp;quot;, didn't you? Did the rioters think about the consequences of what they were doing? No. They did it anyway. They thought nothing of the fact that they may get caught. It was a moment of freedom for them. Their own little moment of freedom.

Of course, I don't condone the violence, especially the deaths of people that occured during the riot.

But what do you think of this theory?

We are free to do anything, as long as no resistance is met, you can do almost anything. The law says you can't shoplift, but there's nothing restraining you from shoplifting, but you will have to meet the consequences of breaking the law.
