Enough of this.

You know, I don't agree with many here, (thankfully.) I'm quick to point this out for several reasons, not the least of which being that I am not always right. I enjoy a good political rhubarb as the next person, but this is getting out of hand. (And some of you thought Claus was bad!)

To put it bluntly, this kind of behavior is precisely the kind of thing the Koch Brothers or Bill Maher get accused of: belittle the opponent, degrade their humanity, malign the intent of their opponents, and on and on. I get a little tired of it, particularly since there's little reason for it. It accomplishes little.

I don't agree with Jon Stewart, yet I can't help but laugh as the guy takes on everyone from Nancy Grace to Newt Gingrich. He's not only fair, he's accurate. He doesn't need strawmen to make his point: The facts do it for him.

No, we don't have a political system like China's. I'm grateful for that. But there are elements of tactics which the Chinese use which make me cringe, and some of these are utterly useless and barbaric. And ultimately, they drive away posters I want to hear from on issues where we might disagree and, (dare I say it), where I might be wrong.

I'm glad there are those of you who have never made a mistake in your political beliefs. Good for you. No doubt your track record demonstrates we ought to be kneeling at your kiln-baked toes and heeding your every word. The rest of us have had to make mistakes and learn from them. It's how I learned to drive a truck, and it's still how I'm learning.

Interestingly enough, I used to be ashamed of not having taken a driving course. On the other hand, in some ways, I'm a better driver than some for having had to learn it the hard way, and having had to take my knocks. It hasn't been easy, and some of the lessons have been expensive. None, however, have resulted in injury or death. It's a lot more than I can say for some of the jokers I've worked with who took extensive driving courses. (Including the guy who rear-ended a city bus, then blamed the passengers for taking too long to board.)

Just a reminder: I'm about to become a business owner. One way or another, it's going to happen. I realize in the parlance of one board member, this will make me a "right-wing (capitalist) drongo," but it's also going to make me an employer. Perhaps not right away, but eventually. There's a lot to learn in this path, and I'm still trying to feel my way through. Easy? No. Mistakes? Bound to be many.

I'm in a country which will allow me the option to make them. I'll take that.

I don't expect anyone to agree with me. But at some point or another, I'd like the opportunity to be heard, without being belittled for it. There are a lot of times when recognizing you're ignorant comes after you've put that ignorance on display.

It's called "learning." No one ever said it would be easy.

Although when a thread gets to the point of being more a pissing match than an opportunity to learn what others think, unsubscribing is very easy.

Perhaps you could try to fully explain your position properly next time instead of leaving it open to interpretation.

I thought I did, but Wolfman left the thread apparently.
