Obama should have invoked the 14th Amendment during the made-up debt crisis created by the Teapubs. He should have kept the Public Option on the table too. The Dems need to stop compromising when it's clear the other side has no intention of doing so. He'd better not compromise and give in to the pipeline if the Repubs attach it to the payroll tax cuts. I've been pretty pleased with Obama on the whole but if he caves on that one too, damn I'm gonna be pissed.

Yeah! it would be a fucking shame to put 20 thousand Americans to work and to find a source that isn't Arab.. we got it. we fucking got it. asswipe.

In this case, you mean Canada's got it. Yeah, it would be a shame to spend all that time and money investing in a filthy, polluting energy source instead of spending time and money on cleaner, cheaper alternatives.
Funny how the House Repubs are fired up all of sudden about jobs when they haven't given a shit about jobs since they took the majority.

And to what extent?

I think Obama has undeniably accomplished a lot in his first 3 years, but his over-reliance on diplomacy with Republicans has impeded critical progress.

I'm sure the cons/repubs on here are undoubtedly going to answer this question too, but at least try and be mature about it...

I absolutely agree with you on the 14th Amendment. Of course, the TPers claim Obama took total control of all medical care in the country, so I'm sure it doesn't take much imagination to know what they would claim if he had gone the 14th Amendment route. Still, would have been nice to see.

I see him compromising on the pipeline just like he did with the tax cuts for the wealthy. The GOP has proven they will destroy families in order to get what they want. Obama really has no choice.

They sure have.

Reid declared the bill DOA anyway so hopefully he won't give Obama a chance to cave. If the payroll tax goes back up 2% to it's original amount, it would suck but it wouldn't be the end of the world to me. Let the GOP Obstructionists play their game. If it's going to hit them in their wallets, they'll eventually scramble and draw up a clean bill.
