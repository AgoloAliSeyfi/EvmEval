I'm not sure you girls will be able to help. This is the second time I happen to dream about that and I always get up being upset and scared.

I guess it's very psychological but here it goes:

I dream that I gave birth and I can't remember what happenned. Whenever I ask Dh either he doesn't answer me and when I ask other people they don't tell me OR I ask DH and he says "well, you got an epidural!" I always wake up extremly mad at him for letting me do that and everything.

I guess part of it has to do with the fact that only hearing the word "epidural" makes me freak out (super scared of needles and even more scared of needles that actually hurt) and the fact that I'm really decided not to have any medication (why I wanted a midwife so badly- they don't give epidurals or pictocin here) but now I'm wondering if there is more to it. I get so scared everytime I dream about that.

I'm not a dream interpreter or anything but that is scary!!

I dream all the time that my bf does something to make me mad then I wake up mad at him. Sometimes I tell him and he laughs. I literally want to yell at him and cry!

I have a lot of WEIRD dreams too, even before I was pregnant. But I think they have gotten more weird since I have been pregnant. I would say that it is a fear that you have in your conscious or something? That's definetly a weird one!

It's normal imo. I had a lot of anxiety about labor &amp; delivery. One of my worst was I just didnt remember giving birth and when I became aware the dr told me the baby didnt make it. I had several variations of that one and sometimes it would just be DH crying that let me know. Another was I lost him but wasn't aware and I was walking around begging for my baby and everyone just stared until the Dr would come and explain he didn't make it.

Its just whatever you're anxious about manifesting itself when you have no control over your mind. Gabe and I came through wonderfully so in no way was it a glimpse of things to come. I know they're scary and sometimes I was a mess for days at the memory bc they were so vivid. Try not to let them bother you.

So far I've not had near the amount I did with Gabe. I think since I've gone through it and know what to expect that my anxiety about it has been greatly reduced.

that is weird-I had a very similar dream last night where I had the baby and was carrying it around but I completely blacked out the delivery. Dh told me that I got the epidural and it messed up and I was paralized and in a coma for a couple months. i freaked because I could bf.
