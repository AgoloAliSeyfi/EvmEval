Bush asked former <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense">Secretary of Defense</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Cheney">Dick Cheney</a> to head up a team to help select a running mate for him, but ultimately, Bush decided that Cheney should be the vice presidential nominee. While the U.S. Constitution does not specifically disallow a president and a vice president from the same state, it 'does' prohibit electors from casting both of his or her votes for persons from his or her own state. Accordingly, Cheney—who had been a resident of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas">Texas</a> for nearly 10 years—changed his voting registration back to Wyoming. Had Cheney not done this, either he or Bush would have forfeited their electoral votes from the Texas electors.

I don't know if he wants to be a senator. They tried to draft him in the last race but he turned them down.

Nelson's a weak candidate but if the GOP nominates someone weak as well - like they did with that Kathy chick with all the make-up who was responsible for the vote count in 2000 - then Nelson will win.

Jeb is done with politics, I predict. He's making too much money, cashing in from his Governorship. Jeb has always been more about money than politics. He's more like his brother Neil than his father.

Plus, who the hell in his right mind would ever vote for another Bush? Of course, if he did run, the Right-tards here would fawn all over him, swearing that this Bush is a conservative. No...really...he's a conservative...not like his brother...this time it's for real...not like his father...nope...he's the real deal!!! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

actually, based on his actions as Governor, Jeb is far more conservative than his brother or his dad

According to usconstitution.net, "A. The Constitution doesn't say that they cannot be from the same state. However, the 12th Amendment does say that electors may not vote for a President from their state and a Vice President also from their state. This issue came up in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_presidential_campaign">2000 presidential campaign</a> when Texas Governor George W. Bush chose fellow Texas resident Richard Cheney to be his running mate. Cheney, who had served in Congress as a Representative from Wyoming, quickly changed his legal residence back to Wyoming to avoid the possible conflict for electors from Texas. Court challenges to Cheney's change of residency were denied.
It is unlikely that two people from the same state would ever be nominated by a major political party. It is constitutionally possible however. If it ever came to pass, the party that won the ticket's state would likely suggest to the electors that their votes for the President go to the presidential nominee and that the votes for the Vice President be given in honor of a party official. Electors in all other states, as mentioned above, would be free to vote for both of the party's nominees."

answers.com is a poor source
at least for a definitive answer

All it's saying is that voters from that particular vote can;t vote for *both*.
So the VP wouldn't carry that state. 56 other states to choose from.

All I can really say is either accept that source or provide a better, more "definitive", one
