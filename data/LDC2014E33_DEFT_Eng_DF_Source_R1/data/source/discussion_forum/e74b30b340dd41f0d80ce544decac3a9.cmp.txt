I don't know how to go about seeking vengence on BP for desecration of the Gulf. I am beside myself. My best friend #3 was going to St. George Island with her family for Mother's Day this weekend. But they will probably cancel because the oil slick will have reached those sugary sand beaches by then.

About a month after the ocean's shores have been befouled, the inland waterways will begin showing the devasation. The Wakulla River, where my kidlet taught me to canoe. The St. John's River, where we hung out in a biker bar in St. Mark's on Fridays after work, eating broiled shrimp and drinking cheap beer, just watching the Earth do it's thing.

Eventually the oil will travel the underground and above-ground aquifer to every Florida body of water, including the beleagered Everglades...a natural phenomena unparrelled on Planet Earth and precious not only to Florida, but to the entire Planet for the role it plays in our wildlife, ecosystem and so on.

Death would not be too severe a punishment for BP's CEO, as I see it.

Don't buy BP gasoline!

Try to boycott, especially if you are purchasing large quantities for a commercial trucking, farming or airline business.

I welcome any additional ideas on how to afflict BP.

I am just heart broken. I cannot tell you what this preventable insult to the Earth will be like for all of Florida, and beyond.

Having lived in Tampa, Orange Park and Jacksonville, I certainly feel your outrage at the carelessness that was in play before this disaster took place and the loss of these natural treasures. So what should we do with the Obama Administration since they accepted the campaign contributions of BP then granted them exemptions from safety standards that would have prevented this catastrophe?

Certainly BP is guilty of buying off our president, but our president is also guilty of willingly being bought off. Personally, I think I'll continue to buy BP products and boycott the corrupt Obama Administration that gave BP an exemption to safety standards.

Exempting them from an ecological impact study isn't exactly giving them a free ride.... All it was was a n ecological impact study it says nothing about them being exempt from any regulations...

And the other link shows nothing other than they give money to both parties pretty much evenly... isn't that going against what we are told about big oil?

Again none of this shows they were able to avoid any regulations...

As someone who recently bought a place literally a stone's throw off the pristine beaches in South Walton Country, I am more than a little concerned about the oil slick hitting my piece of paradise. I am also against drilling off the Florida coast as an oil spill could have a devastating effect on our economy.

However, I am not supporting a boycott of BP. As much as I do not like this disaster, and as much as I will want BP and the other energy companies to clean up this mess, and as much as I do not want to see this again, I do not think BP is the primary culprit in all this. We as a society have chosen to drill in a very dangerous part of the world. Occasionally, disasters are going to happen. We should do everything we can to prevent such disasters, but they will happen. Boycotting BP doesn't do anything more to emphasize that they must take better care of their operations. They already are aware.
