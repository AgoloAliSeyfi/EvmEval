So I was living at a homeless tent city called camp take notice in Ann Arbor and I was living in a tent with the man I was in a relationship with. The problem is that this man was violent and abused me beating me and generally hurting me. One night he put a knife to my throat and the next day two friends of mine who happen to be feminists helped me get away, in effect rescuing me. This man came after me and got loud, drunk and aggressive in a very public situation and was threatening to hit me also raising his hand to me in the process. Even though the people who run camp take notice are aware of what went down, they decided to take no action on it. The precedent should be there considering how many men have gotten kicked out for getting drunk and violent towards other men. I feel the only difference is that he got drunk and got violent towards me, the woman he was in a relationship with. I find this incredibly sexist. Men outnumber women in the camp somewhere between 5 to 1 and 10 to 1. The discussion I am trying to get at is: how should we deal with patriarchy, sexism, domestic abuse, etc. in the homeless community?

The difference in that situation being that 'sexism against men' isn't, because it's not institutionalized as patriarchy is. That's the mindset that people volunteering as 'safe person' or 'security' need to have. It may require camp councils or assemblies to start getting that line of thought more public.

I understand your position on what should be done. Which I think is a good idea.

But could you elaborate on why you think this isn't an expression of patriarchy? Because I think what she suffered was a form of patriarchy. Maybe I misread or something.

And Esperanza, this is a horrible situation for you. How did you get in the camp? And how are you dealing with this? Is the guy still bothering you?

Also...and do not take this personal or as an attempt to blame shift here in any way shape or form...because the behaviour and how these men treat you is unacceptable...but you often have these experiences with men.

If you can, find ways to hurt him in secrecy. While he is sleeping, there are limitless options as to how you can "Defend yourself" <img src="revleft/smilies/wink.gif"/>

I don't know how realistic this is and I don't know if it would help you. But this is how I would deal with it. Are you still in the camp? If not forget what I said.

I think things like Patriarchy, sexism and domestic abuse should be dealt with by kicking out the violators. I don't know if the police would help, as the bastards beat their partners a lot more.
