The Glock dealer was no more a perpetrator than the American Imam.

The Glock dealer would not think to open up a store on the site of a mass murder. Nobody would defend the decency of his decision to do that, including me.

The American Imam, he doesn't have the same decency and respect.

Cool. Using that logic, if some Christian goes postal in some small town in America, we'll demolish the church....

Impossible. Christianity has never been responsible for any atrocities throughout the history of mankind.

I'm betting if Christian were responsible for atrocities you'd love them more. sic.

That aside Your analogy is flawed. If 20 people were killed by a gun, then you have a point. To make your analogy similar you would have to have somebody open a place that sells aeroplanes. IOW, a mosque had nothing to do with it....

</quote>

Actually, mosques were used to plot attacks, here and all over the world.

That's not in dispute.

That sounds like a crime!

You know, the kind of thing where, if you could prove it, you could actually get people locked up for!

So now you're comparing one of the eight wonders of the world with the twin towers? More worryingly, you are comparing a 3rd world shithole's morals/mores/norms with that of the USA. How does that feel?

The site of the WTC is hallowed ground, just like where the USS Arizona sunk. There are remains of Americans brutally killed in both of those places.

It deserves the same reverence, decency, and respect.

So just how far is the standoff from Ground Zero to the point where you want to afford Americans their constitutional rights?

</quote>

There are hundreds of mosques in NYC, and several offers of alternate sites.

It's not an issue of Constitutional rights, it's an issue of the lack of decency and respect shown by American Imams.

</quote>

It's absolutely an issue of constitutional rights.

If you claimed to be respectful and decent, why would you thumb your nose at familes of survivors who asked to to build your mosque elsewhere?

</quote>

I felt similar to you at the outset. Then I realised that you are punishing people through no fault of their own.

So, those good "christian" folk in Mississippi who killed those three civil rights' boys back in the 60s should have their local church demolished?

Where did Timothy McVeigh discuss the Oklahoma bombing with Terry Whatshisname? The local Taco Bell? And if so, is that to be demolished, too?

Who are the US Imans doing the same?

No it's not. It's mainly commercial real estate. And you can't walk on any ground in New York City..someone hasn't croaked on.
