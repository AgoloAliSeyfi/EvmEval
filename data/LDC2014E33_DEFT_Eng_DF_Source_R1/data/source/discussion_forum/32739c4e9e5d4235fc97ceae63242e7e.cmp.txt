I apologise in advance if there is something similar to this thread, but this is a topic that has interested me recently and would just like to hear your views on the matter.
I'm a British Pakistani, born and brought up in London, however I would say I am very much in touch with my roots and my views lean more towards the traditional and conservative side. Recently I watched a documentary by Saira Khan 'Don't tell my Mother I am in Pakistan', made a few years ago, yet a very interesting watch. I have been on holiday to Pakistan a fair amount of times, and have traveled throughout the country, so I thought I had a pretty accurate idea of the country as a whole and it's people. However, after watching the documentary and various other programs and films on Pakistan I am absolutely shocked. I may be wrong when I say this, but was Pakistan not founded as a Muslim state, yet only 64 years on and I don't think the country matches the vision it was initially created with. It seems that the higher class are obsessed with imitating and adopting western culture, in a sense it boosts their superiority complex. I actually find it shocking, that most families who moved to England in the 60's like my grandfather have managed to maintain that cultural pride and certain traditions that have been lost among certain groups of people in Pakistan. Drinking is a common practice with the upper class society and personally I find it quite upsetting, it seems as if Pakistan is moving in the opposite direction- the rich becoming more obsessed with western culture and the less well off being neglected further. Also whilst I'm on this topic, has anyone seen the film 'Slackistan' and what were your views?

Hard for me to answer as I've probably been over doctrinated from Western Ideals. However I believe that if westernisation means Pakistan become more liberated and open/ tolerant to other beliefs/culture/style then I'm all for it, (of course, I'm hoping that this would outweigh the exploitive constraints that comes with Westernisation).
