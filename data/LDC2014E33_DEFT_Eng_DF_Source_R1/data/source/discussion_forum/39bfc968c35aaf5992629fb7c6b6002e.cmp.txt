Well, the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei seems to think so, and round about now many people in this country would go along with him on that one.

But I do not think our government is the only "evil" government. The U.S. government is certainly a close runner-up, if not first place! I am of course referring to America, the Federal Reserve and the banking cartel Oligarchs. There is certainly an "evil" elitism going on in the world right now. Rome has an elite. It is called the Vatican. We have the Tory party <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/p.gif" alt=":p:"/>

But was the Ayatollah right?

Is our government the most "evil" in the world?

Our government seems to put banks, big business and capitalism before the needs of the people (assuming that they do not need rampant capitalism and huge superstores). We bailed out the elite bankers with tax payers money and now the big businesses are sacking folk.

We (not I) work for a ruling elite. We are, some would say, slaves on our own land. Although slaves don't get a wage, we are payed a pittance for hard work. Now they want us to work for free!!

We were taken to war with an imaginary foe. It was merely for America's need for oil. There were no WMDs, and the government duped the people into believing that U.S. style democracy would be good for the Middle East. We tortured our prisoners of war. We shut up and shut out those who dared to speak out. We consored and we covered over, and sexed up the truth. Our government no longer listens to the people they were elected by. Our government is more concerned with international affairs; trying to sort out the affairs of other countries whilst leaving our own to rot away. Our people are lost for want of leadership. Our children are laid waste and desolate. (Sorry if I sound like Isaiah here).

The government have brought in more than a hundred laws since the terrorist attacks. The issue over who caused the 9/11 attacks will always prompt conspiracy theorists to speculate that the U.S. government was behind it all to shore up American solidarity in their "war on oil" with the Middle East.

Are we the "evil" ones here? I sometimes wonder. Then there is the EU. Now, there's a candidate for "evil" if there ever was one! Nation shall rise against nation, as the saying goes.

Aren't we now in a culture war, a religious war, an economic war, a social war, an internal war, a political war?

When you look at it we are at war right now, and many of us do not know. This war is unlike any gone before.

Was the Ayatollah right?

No Poll included.

I think New Labour reached new lows of deceit and bullying, however it could be argued that the media culture does not help them, that's not too pleasant either and has to take a share of the blame. But yes, our government does feel to me like bullies, and I would like to try the Tories out.

But, no, I would hardly say we are the most evil in the world, that would be a trite judgement.

You should try and avoid attacking certain political parties, especially one as currently popular as the Conservatives.
Some people feel very strongly about politics and you will get a mixed response.

I do feel that the British Government is an evil one, but wouldn't go as far as to say the Tories are the reason, after having 12 years of Labour with massive public debt and endless stealth taxes. The government during the war was a Conservative Government and they did the world of good for the public. The fundamental beliefs are still there.

...and the majority are more than happy to just watch it all unfold, because they all feel worthless and unimportant.

Have you been to China recently?

Our government's not been great the past few years, we're into a load of problems right now, and I do feel as though we need a new leader, but if you compare our government to many others, it's not that bad, they've just made mistakes.

Some people need to shut up about bankers. You realise how hard they work and how much money they generate for our country??? Sure sometimes it doesnt seem fair but theres no chance in hell you, me or most people could do their jobs. Also when theres a downturn they get fired pretty much straight away. 1 banker on a decent wage working hard probably pays for 10 people to go on the dole each year with his tax.

The banks crashed. The reason they got bailed out is because if they didnt the whole financial system mightve been bought down and we wouldve gone back to the stone ages. Sooo many countries bailed out their financial institutions, it isnt just a UK wide policy.

And how the **** is the feedral reserve evil? All they do is try to promote financial stability in the US.

Conclusion: youre an idiot. Ayatollah is just peddling to the populist much like our politicians do. Listen to the proper policy makers, not the media **** chat.
