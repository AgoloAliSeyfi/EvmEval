Another myth of the Kool-Aid banging left.

I got a pretty fair reduction in my tax bill, and I'm nowhere near the "richest of the rich".

In any case, the basis of the thread is still shot to hell.

</quote>

There was a capital gains tax cut and dividend tax cut that expires this year. That's a tax cut for the rich.

</quote>

I created LLC and trust organizations to run my business dealings through back in the early '90s. I get a fair amount of my end income out of that business structure in dividends, and I'm still nowhere near "rich".

Suffice to say you have NFI what you're talking about....Best quit while you're behind.

</quote>

Thanks again, for proving my other point while you're struggling to argue with me and insult me.

The tax cuts were not for the middle class, on earned income. They were on dividends and capital gains.

Pretty much...I quit listening to him because he's such a damned negative Nancy.

In any case, he was busting pretty hard on the administration and the (R) congress for spending like crazy.

</quote>

Savage and Boortz were going pretty nuts too.

And in the end, Bush's poll numbers were circling the drain because of his spending... among other things.

</quote>

Savage is definitely an equal opportunity hater.

I find him entertaining as all hell (in two minute bursts).

</quote>

It's true. I can only listen in small doses. Too much lunatic fringe screaming.

"We inherited built-in increases in entitlement spending" I believe was the popular refrain.

Sound familiar? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/banghead.gif"/>

</quote>

OK then, thanks for helping me prove my point.

Weren't you just among the re-writers of history arguing with me on this point?

</quote>

I wasn't re-writing anything.....There were a lot of people making lots of noise about the excessive spending, and not all of it was coming from the leftist wacko fringe.

The Bushbots were 25%-ers.

</quote>

But no tea parties. Not many news stories. No one really concerned about it, until now. You might consider Beck to be a lot of people, but not really that many people pay any attention to that psycho.

You should have lent me your crystal ball. I don't have one. And yet even if I knew, I'd have approved. We aren't in a great depression now BECAUSE of what Obama's done with his policies.

</quote>

I think your leather thong is about 5 sizes too small and it's cutting off the circulation to your brain.

All Obamalamadingdong has done is spend like a madman.

He makes Bush look like Goldwater.

Hell, Obama makes Clintoon look like Goldwater.

</quote>

Not easy to find something to comment on in your post filled with nonsense, but there's one part that stands out.

Clinton left us with a budget surplus.

</quote>

and what is Obama going to leave us with?

Some CD's?
