Not to mention how they treat infants and children!

Praise God!

1Sa 15:3 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.

Is 13: 15 Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword.
16 Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.

De 2:34 And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:

De 3:6 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.

Ez 9: 5 And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity:
6 Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women...

Hosea 13: 16 Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.

Psalms 137: 9 Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.

The Christian holy book is replete with violent instructions and absurd proclamations and tenets. The problem is that westernized Christian nations have moved beyond such idiocy in The Bible, and MOST PEOPLE recognize that those chapters and verses in The Bible were written in times of medieval ignorance.

No, much earlier than medieval days.

Many of the people of predominantly Muslim countries have remained stuck in the past, simply because the industrial revolution has been slow to catch up there and modernize those countries which ultimately results in better educating the brain to a higher plane of thinking.

Noble Quran 2:190 Footnote: Jihad is holy fighting in Allahs Cause with full force of numbers and weaponry. It is given the utmost importance in Islam and is one of its pillars. By Jihad Islam is established, Allahs Word is made superior (which means only Allah has the right to be worshiped), and Islam is propagated. By abandoning Jihad Islam is destroyed and Muslims fall into an inferior position; their honor is lost, their lands are stolen, their rule and authority vanish. Jihad is an obligatory duty in Islam on every Muslim. He who tries to escape from this duty, or does not fulfill this duty, dies as a hypocrite.

Why the reactionaries all gripe about "bending over backwards?

Because like most reactionaries they lack much creative imagination.

That's in part why they're reactionaries, actually.
