In the Fox debate last week one of the candidates made the claim that Clinton gutted the military. This is all well and good except for the fact that 6 of Bill Clinton's 8 budgets were passed by Republican majorities in both houses of Congress. So if the military was gutted in the 1990s it was Republicans, like McCain and Thompson and Paul, that gutted it. Huckabee is the only candidate in the Fox debate whom I remember expressly calling for increasing the size of the military. I would rather risk an unknown than knowns whose records are dismal.

And as a matter of fact....Bush Sr. gutted the Army, not Clinton.

How so? Just what did George H. W. Bush do the army?

Huckabee may be able to attract evangelical Republicans, but he won't attract less tax, small government Repubs,

Is this constituency large enough to put someone in the White House? Are there at least 50,000,000 voters who want their taxes lowered?

BTW: Is it true that Huckabee raised taxes in Arkansas because the courts said he had to spend more money on public schools and that by raising such taxes and spending such money Arkansas' public schools are ranked #8 in the nation?

and he won't attract Repub foreign policy hawks.

More importantly, he won't attrack big contributions. Populists don't usually get the support of the Big Money, unless it Unions, and that money goes to Dems - no question.

If Huckabee has a message or campaign style that can attract 30-40% of the GOP primary electorate what need will he have for large contributions? Personally I wouldn't want a candidate that thinks he has to have large contributions because by accepting them the candidate subjects himself to large obligations- which are likely detrimental to my personal welfare.

Huckabee is not attracting the support of either fiscal conservatives or foreign policy hawks. The social conservatives who he does attract do not represent a large enough bloc to carry him through, even assuming he can capture them all.

All candidates need big money supporters. It's nice to imagine that the grass roots could fund a candidate with contributions of $5 and $10 but this isn't going to happen in this race and especially not so if Huckabee can't attract more than 50% of the rank and file.

It was Giuliani who mentioned this is in the debate. Read the blurb by <a href="http://www.factcheck.org">www.factcheck.org</a> below.

Giuliani falsely blamed President Clinton for cuts in the military that occurred in large part under President George H.W. Bush and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. He said that "the Army had been at 725,000; it's down to 500,000." That's true, but it was down to 572,423 by the time Clinton took office.

...

Actually, most of the cutting to which Giuliani refers occurred during the administration of George H.W. Bush. At the end of fiscal year 1993 (which was Bush's last one in office), the Army had 572,423 active-duty soldiers - a far cry from 725,000. In fact, to get to that number, one has to go back to 1990, during the first gulf war. Moreover, Clinton's cuts in the military, while large, were nowhere close to 25 percent to 30 percent. Between 1993 and 2001, the Army went from 572,423 to 480,801, which is a decline of 16 percent. The entire military went from 1,705,103 to 1,385,116, a decrease of 18.8 percent.

Compare that with the far larger cuts made during the first Bush administration: In 1989, the military stood at 2,130,229 and the Army had 769,741 soldiers. By 1993, those numbers had declined by 19.9 percent and 25.6 percent, respectively.

And as we've pointed out before, it was the first Bush administration - specifically then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney - that began bragging openly of the peace dividend.
