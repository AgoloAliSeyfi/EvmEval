Yes I did see this lol! But I figure 20,000 is a heck of a lot...both arms probably took around 100 between them (if that) so 12 weeks will be 1200 in total leaving me plenty left to do other areas. So you still get a lot compared to lots of other machines I've read up about. I will change my original post though lol.

I suppose it depends on how 'permanent' it'll be or if they will need topping up every 6 months or so...if they do, I'll probably still try to return it as it's not permanent like it says it should be or will just find out how much the replacement piece of kit is and if it's reasonable and it's working well for lengthy periods will just buy that.

I will be zapping them again tomorrow and shaving them again tonight. It's been a week and although quite a few of the hairs have grown back it's nowhere near as course/noticable as I thought it would be so I'm quite pleased so far!

Fair enough, I was expecting it to be more like one per hair.

I've suffered with excess body hair since I was young, and I was bullied because of it through primary/secondary school and now am unable to wear tshirts etc in public because of how paranoid I am about it. I went to the doctors because of it when I was around 11, and they did a blood test but it came back normal so I assume I don't have PCOS.

I have very hairy arms for a girl, not thick hairs like a males but lots of very noticable, dark and long (I bleach regularly but it only lasts a day or two before the roots are noticable). I have never shaved them because I shave my legs and get terrible ingrown hairs, even though I moisturise/exfoliate etc. I've tried waxing but it only lasted 2 days before the hairs began to grow back, so it's really not worth it.

Anyway I checked out reviews and after shopping around I decided to get the £350 Boots Smooth Skin Plus Intense Pulsed Light permanent hair reduction machine. The reviews were on the whole very good, it comes with 20,000 flashes (it takes between 70-100 flashes to do my arms each time I think) and you need applicator gel which is £3. It appears to do exactly the same thing as you would get in a laser clinic, but cheaper and means I will be able to target any missed hairs you might get going to a clinic and it's obviously private/convenient.

The sales assistant in Boots was very helpful, and assured me I could get a no-quibble refund if I find it doesn't work but she assured me it will.

I'm going to use it on my arms first of all, because this is the area that affects me the most confidence wise, but will gradually move on to other areas. For permanent hair reduction I will need to use the machine once a week for between 6-12 weeks (although I will probably need 12 weeks!) and will start using it tonight.

I'm quite sceptical over whether it will work but because I'm confident I can return it, I think it was worth the risk.

I know other girls on here have the same issue with excess body hair, so will monitor the hair reduction over the 12 weeks course to let you know how it goes incase anyone else is thinking of buying one <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

Week 1: Shaved my arms and zapped them today, did it in two separate goes (took around 30 mins to do each arm) and my sister did them for me just because certain angles are tricky to get to. On a pain scale I'd give it 2/10 (just feels like a hot, tingling sensation for about 1 second then fades). Will update what the regrowth is like next Saturday.

Week 2: Had to shave my arms again last night all over, hair regrowth not as course or fast as expected but still widespread. Just finished zapping them again but this time did it myself, found it to be much quicker.

I have used it for nearly 30 weeks now. I've been using it on my underarms, feet, upper lip, bikini area and forearms. My underarms worked best and barely grew back anymore. My bikini area was starting to work really well asell. Then I stopped using it for about 4 weeks after using it every week for 18. It all grew back. I've started using it again weekly but given that I have pale skin and very dark hairs and use it on the highest setting... I think I may be demading my money back. All the positive reviews tend to be those who have done 4 treatments. I think it shocks the hair so it doesn't grow back quickly but if you stop using it, its not perminent <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/>
