CFLs will actually cut down on mercury pollution produced by coal burning, and EPA agrees.

"By using less electricity, CFLs help reduce mercury emissions from coal-burning power plants, which are the largest source of human-caused mercury emissions in the United States," said agency press officer Ernest Jones. (Related: "Clean Coal? New Technology Buries Greenhouse Emissions" [May 2, 2006].)

And nuclear power would produce all the emission free electricity we need without having to use mercury for light bulbs.

"Recycling programs are already in place in many areas," noted mercury clean-up expert Hogue. "Community leaders don't need to reinvent the wheel."

If recycling is not possible, used CFLs should be sealed inside a plastic bag and taken to a household hazardous waste disposal site, just as should batteries, oil-based paint, and motor oil, EPA recommends.

Web sites such as Earth 911 and Light Recycle can provide local disposal options.

nuclear is part of the solution.

Its NOT the whole solution.

It has a byproduct that is very dangerous.

Wouldnt you like to see an alternative developed that did NOT give any other countrys the ability to have this byproduct which can be turned into a bomb?

So... in an effort to save the planet we're using bulbs that are now deemed hazardous waste?

That's smart.

You fuckers slay me.

Fear mongering.

I want a stable energy supply that does not need ever increasing taxpayer subsidies so it can pretend to run profitably.

Large scale wind is not profitable and is a blight on the landscape.

That is right wing propaganda.

The amounts in each bulb is tiny and presents no dangers

Incandescent bulbs have none. They're all I use and all I will ever use.

That's what I use. No mercury, dangerous chemicals. I've worked with mercury and it's dangerous, especially the vapors.

You can bet your last dime that when there are no more non toxic bulbs, the environmentalists will come out and start on removing the fluorescent lighting. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>
