ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- A moderate Muslim cleric who denounced suicide attacks as forbidden by Islam was killed Friday in a suicide attack on his mosque in Lahore, authorities said.

A Pakistani rescue worker works outside a damaged room of Jamia Naimia religious school.

Sarfraz Ahmed Naeemi was the first imam in Pakistan to issue a fatwa, or religious edict, against suicide attacks in Pakistan.

On Friday, a suicide bomber approached Naeemi as he left the Jamia Naimia Mosque and religious school. The bomber detonated his explosives, killing Naeemi and two others, police said. Another 10 people were wounded in the attack.

Naeemi had recently received death threats because of his opposition to the Taliban and his support of the current Pakistani military offensive against Taliban militants, his son told local television.

It was one of two mosque bombings in Pakistan on Friday, which has suffered a series of attacks in the wake of its ongoing military campaign

<quote>
5 hrs ago YALA, Thailand (AFP) — Suspected Muslim militants decapitated a rubber-tapper and displayed his head on a stick outside his house in the latest violence in Thailand's troubled south, police said Monday.

The attack comes amid a recent spike in bloodshed in the restive Muslim-majority region bordering Malaysia, where more than 3,700 people have been killed during a bitter five-year insurgency.

Police said the 53-year-old victim's body was found with the head, hands and lower legs removed at his makeshift house on a rubber plantation in volatile Yala province on Monday morning.

The attackers stuck his head on a stick and put it in front of the building, they said.

In neighbouring Narathiwat province, a suspected insurgent gunman riding a motorcycle shot dead a Muslim man in front of his house, also on Monday, police said.

Meanwhile a bomb hidden inside a motorcycle and triggered by mobile phone exploded in Narathiwat on Sunday evening, injuring ten people who were shopping at a weekend market, they added.

Thailand's government is struggling to curb the sudden upsurge in violence in the south that erupted in recent weeks, including a bloody attack on a mosque in which gunmen shot dead 11 people during evening prayers.

The insurgents have in the past targeted both security forces and civilians -- Buddhist and Muslim alike -- ranging from teachers to rubber plantation workers.....

They are not familiar with multi-religious society and didn't handle this well since 2004. Now this seems to have past a point of no return.

5 hrs ago BANGKOK (AP)  Ten Muslim villagers killed by gunmen firing assault rifles into a mosque during evening prayers. A 53-year-old Buddhist rubber tapper shot, decapitated and limbs cut from his torso, his head impaled on a stick.

The circumstances and brutality of those attacks this month have revived fears that a long-running insurgency in Thailand's south could be evolving into a sectarian conflict pitting Buddhists against Muslims.

Islamic separatists ignited the insurgency in January 2004, sparking a cycle of army repression and rebellion that has left more than 3,500 people dead. Frustrated by their inability to curb the violence, Thai security forces have increasingly been arming civilian self-defense forces  almost all Buddhist  to protect villagers.

The proliferation of guns, many put in the poorly trained hands of parties with scores to settle, makes the situation extremely volatile.

The June 8 attack on the Al Furqan mosque in Narathiwat province's Joh-I-Rong district and its aftermath suggest such initiatives may have backfired.
..
With cold deliberation, five or six masked gunmen dressed in black poured fire into the mosque, which serves a community that had avoided the deadly tumult of recent years....

Many local Muslims believe the mosque massacre was revenge for the killing of a young Buddhist rubber plantation worker in a nearby district earlier that day....

<quote>
June 27 (Bloomberg) -- Thai anti-government protesters who support former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra plan to meet in Bangkok today in what organizers say will be the largest rally since the army quelled riots by the group in April.

The demonstrators, who say the constitution gives too much power to judges, bureaucrats and royal advisers at the expense of elected politicians, will meet throughout the night and leave in the early morning hours, Jatuporn Prompan, a protest leader, said by telephone. The rally should be peaceful unless security forces attempt to disperse the group, he said....

The protest may pressure Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to hasten plans to amend the constitution as a reconciliation panel gets ready to propose changes next month. The protesters say Abhisit is illegitimate because he came to power after a court dissolved the former pro-Thaksin ruling party.

Thailands political turmoil has weighed on the benchmark SET index, which is trading at 11 times estimated earnings for this year, the second-lowest in Asia after Pakistan. The index, up 35 percent so far this year, remains 24 percent below its level a year ago.....

Abhisit imposed a state of emergency for 12 days in April after protesters backed by Thaksin forced the cancellation of an Asian summit, clogged up traffic and set fires around the capital. Soldiers used tear gas to disperse them, leading to clashes that left at least two dead and more than 100 injured.....
