Here's the text of the so-called "apology" issued Saturday by the Fat Man. If this was any weaker, it would look like swiss cheese with all the holes in it. Of course, it'll appease his dittoloonies. "For over 20 years, I have illustrated the absurd with absurdity, three hours a day, five days a week. In this instance, I chose the wrong words in my analogy of the situation. I did not mean a personal attack on Ms. Fluke.

"I think it is absolutely absurd that during these very serious political times, we are discussing personal sexual recreational activities before members of Congress. I personally do not agree that American citizens should pay for these social activities. What happened to personal responsibility and accountability? Where do we draw the line? If this is accepted as the norm, what will follow? Will we be debating if taxpayers should pay for new sneakers for all students that are interested in running to keep fit ? In my monologue, I posited that it is not our business whatsoever to know what is going on in anyone's bedroom nor do I think it is a topic that should reach a Presidential level.

"My choice of words was not the best, and in the attempt to be humorous, I created a national stir. I sincerely apologize to Ms. Fluke for the insulting word choices."

No wonder he claims his talent for lying is on loan from Gawwwd-da, he can even spew his BS in an "apology." Now the pathological liar knows she pays for her health care insurance, not the American taxpayer.

Palin is a public figure. Fluke isn't. There's a huge difference, though it might take a few days to explain it to Republicans.

The American taxpayer is paying trillions for right wing nuts like Limbaugh who helped get George Bush elected.

All this faux outrage from the Left, where the Hell were you when Maher, Letterman &amp; Schultz were spewing their misogynistic bile at conservative women? Oh, that's right, you were cheering and laughing like a pack of rabid hyenas! Y'all are a bunch of hypocritical FAKES, and you've put yourselves on display in all your indignant glory.

Bunch of fucking losers, each and EVERY one of you.

Then Limbaugh shouldn't have apologized. If he wants to be a 'shock jock' he can't be pussying out every time the public raises an eyebrow.

That's not how Howard Stern operates.
