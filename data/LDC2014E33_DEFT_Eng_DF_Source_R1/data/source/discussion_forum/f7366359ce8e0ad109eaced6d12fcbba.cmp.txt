Actually, what would be the point in going back to the moon. Now a manned landing on mars, I can get behind that! We've been to the moon several times. We didn't build anything permanent, so I don't see the point in going back if we're not going to build anything permanent there.

You may be surprised beowolfe but I agree there is no sense in returning to the moon if your just going there to plant the flag. Then "been there done that" argument holds sway if that were the case. However, if the program was a long term program meant to establish a presence there and exploit the moons resources for our benefit, science, as well as to be used for training for long term space flight missions to Mars then its well worth it. I know I have posted this before. but here is a little info on the subject beowolfe.

New energy sources and climate change go hand in hand, yet you dismiss the latter and don't agree it's worth pursuing using NASA appropriations. I don't get it.

I'm aware of the 50 million given to Space-X for the CRV in fact I already posted the information on it in another thread. One other thing, the reason why most like me think private enterprise is the ONLY way to go now is because our Govt. does not have the vision or the courage to sustain a program like Apollo. If you work in the research part of NASA, Ames etc. I'm sure your overjoyed at this decision, however, I would suggest you see how well this decision is goping over at Johnson and Huntsville. Further, the former director of NASA might disagree with that assertion as well.

Doesn't have the vision to "sustain" Apollo? How old IS that program? The space program has advanced far beyond Apollo because it has been sustained. You really do need to read what other experts in the field are saying, my friend. I realize your take on this is strictly from a patriotic point of view, and that's noble, but really, the "moon" has become secondary to exploration of other realms within our galaxy. Here's a list of articles for you to peruse.

The moon is the only thing close enough to explore. We need to practice on the Moon before we can land and takeoff on Mars. The advances that building a base on the Moon would helpful when it comes to exploring the rest of space...if we ever do. Thanks to Obama's cuts all of this is lost.

Now the Space-shuttle program is going tits up thanks to him so we're pretty much out of the space business. I guess this his way of sucking up to other countries like China and Russia. Putting our programs in mothballs.

Pretty expensive "practice" jaunts, I'd say. The moon is deader than a doornail as far as sustaining life. If we're going to be sending humans to another planet, we should be preparing to send them where we know that planet at least sustains some form of life as we know it.

In Russia, 56% positively evaluate the work of Obama. We look forward to what he would do for the United States that Gorbachev in Russia. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

Obama has high marks for likablity in the polls. His agenda is getting ripped in the polls.

That decision on halting the Constellation program and moving appropriations elsewhere within the NASA budget resulted from the evaluation by an independent panel of experts on the subject. Obama didn't just wake up one morning and say "Hey, I know where I can save a coupla billion more! Let's piss off some more folks!"
