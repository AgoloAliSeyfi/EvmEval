Thanks, I have been looking for a new foamy mattress and supporty pillow, but my mum said she'd buy me one...but that was about two months ago and the dehumidifier to get the damp outa my room was 4 months ago and the heater for the freezing cold winters was bout year and half ago....empty promises, lies so many LIES!!!!!
Anyway, I can't really stop carrying my bag, my history file and bout 3 or 4 heavy books really kill my shoulder, then if I try to leave a couple at home my crazy history teacher has a go...I can't win...

No, I'm all better now after the trampoline incident...the most recent one that is....it's just this shoulder pain. First my dr prescribed me 84 ibuprofen, to burn my stomach lining away, and help with the pain of course. The my physio said 'Stop taking the ibuprofen, that won't help.' God, what does SHE know? Stupid cow. Anyway, I'll try that exercise Green Witch, see if it helps...thanks for your advice guys!! <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"/>

I hurt my right shoulder and wrist slipping on the floor of a restaurant as we were being led to the table. No we were not in the bar first. It took a while but the shoulder has been giving me a lot of trouble and it has been about 8 months since the accident. The thing that helps me out is exercise with light (5 lb) free weights. I checked with my doctor first, because I didn't want to compound the injury. Tlhe doctor told me that a painful muscle is a weak muscle and apparently she was right. I took a class and also got a dvd called "weights for dummies". It's not too strenuous but it does strenthen the muscle.

Perhaps you have tendinitis near the armpits (feels like shoulder pain). If you get it scanned by ultrasound, a doctor may find the culprit, and prescribe what's needed.

Mmmm. Glitterbag....did you sue?!
Yeah, I was thinking ultrasound-wise coz that would also break up any calcium deposits and get the blood flowing better... Thing is, I've started getting this different pain now, it's sorta moving round, so sometimes I get pain at the front of my shoulder and it's more...I dunno, maybe muted, but still as painful, if you know what I mean, less sharp... I'm a bit worried that it's getting worse...

No honey, I didn't sue. It's a big pain in the butt to sue someone. Besides, what I do is worse. I tell everybody in the area about the incident and let them decide if they want to take a chance in high heels on a too-slick floor.

Mmm I'd say that's pretty reasonable...!...I've come off milk and dairy stuff now coz of suspected lactose intolerance.....it's a pain in the a**...but my shoulder pain has mysteriously gone away...it does come back occasionaly when I'm really stressed out...but only mildly and only for a little while....Touch wood....!....but anyway...yeah...blah blah blah...

Start carrying your bag in your arms like a baby or get one of those bags that are more like suitcases. Just don't carry it on your shoulder anymore! You gotta prevent more pain from coming on.

Start swimming. Great exercise.

I worked in homecare for many years. I'm a little woman and I hurt my shoulder very badly at one point. I was lifting people around all day. I learnt the hard way what the human shoulder is capable of and what it is not.

All medicines and exercises and beds won't help if you keep aggrivating the area. You gotta rest it up and take care of yourself. Bottom line.

Wear a backpack type of purse; they make plenty of them in various styles. It has helped my shoulder a lot. When I do get a flareup (usually from typing on this thing too much!) I go to an acupuncturist - they work wonders! Also, as flushd suggested, swimming- or kayaking, if you live near the water - helps immensely. Good luck.

I wouldn't of thought Kayaking would help, I really enjoy Kayaking when I can go, haven't been recently...Thx for your advice guys...my shoulder pain still hasn't come back as bad since I've been cutting out lactosey things....it's great!! Except I can't have ice-cream.... :5(
I woz wondering bout acupuncture...I don't think I could handle it though..I got really queasy taking out my new earrings!!!
I've been to hospital now and talked to a Dr who actaully listened and did something about it...I'm on a 6 MONTH waiting list for an MRI scan and a 6 week waiting list for physio...hopefully get it sorted out for good!!
