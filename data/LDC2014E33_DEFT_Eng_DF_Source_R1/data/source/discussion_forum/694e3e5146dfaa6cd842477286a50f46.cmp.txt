The Catholic Church is opposed to contraception for moral reasons.

Where is the morality in creating a life when food and clean water are rare commodities? Where poverty exists and educational opportunities are non existent?

Where is the morality when disease is spread?

Where is the morality when a women is the victim of domestic violence? When a women is forced to conceive and then trapped as the child become a lever to gain more power and more control?

i find it much more interesting that the religious right pushes for abortion to become illegal, because life is sacred, while at the same time opposing universal health care.

its extremely hypocritical to say life is sacred when your willing to fight to protect an unborn life, but not willing to fight to protect people who have already been born.

when you force women to have children they may not want, in many cases they become dependent on the state for services such as medicaid, food stamp, welfare, the foster system, etc etc.

Actually, It is how this Universal Health care is implemented.

The method this adminstration is using is more of a corporatists venture in which the citizen is forced to buy insurance.

The preferred method for a universal health care is more of a socialistic venture in which everyone contributes to a fund to pay for the health care.

Both methods have draw backs, the corporatist approach still institutes the insurance companies which will seek to turn a profit by short changing the policy--also, by forcing demand, the insurance companies can raise their rates to ensure more profit for their companies. There is little reason not to do this since the competitive spirit of the free market is being challenged by the lack of choice including not buying. The socialistic approach is still faced with rising costs in comparison to standard of living and the inefficiency of government. Pluss extra.

what is wrong with a system where everyone pays the same and everyone gets access to the same services? (i.e. single payer)

They aren't pro life... they're pro birth.

if they weren't, they'd be arranging adoptions for unwanted children.

if they weren't, they'd be supporting day care and job training and education for unwed mothers

if they weren't, they'd support WIC and head start.

but they are....

because it isn't about "life", it's about punishing the harlots and making women incubators.

which is why something like 80% of anti-choice activists are men.

Hmmmm? All of the church organizations providing such services would beg to differ with you. Feel free to Google.
