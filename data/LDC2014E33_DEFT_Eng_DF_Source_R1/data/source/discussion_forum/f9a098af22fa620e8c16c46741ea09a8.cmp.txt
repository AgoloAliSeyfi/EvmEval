Have to agree with thenudeone. Bus passes are an approved form of ID and are free, apart from the photographs.

In applying for a credit card with HSBC (where she's had a joint account with her late husband for at least 100 years) we did offer her Freedom Pass as this was the only form of photo ID she had. Not acceptable they said, although the guy at the bank is trying to sort it out and we are due to go back this afternoon to see if we've had any success. In his defence, he was a bit embarrassed by the bank's rigid approach. I'll update you with the outcome. I have also just realised my wife is now in the exact same situation. In fact it gets worse - you can't actually renew your old style pink driving license without a passport as proof of id!
Its a good job you don't need photo id to renew a passport or the whole thing will grind to a halt!

I'm not sure how people with privacy concerns about the national ID database scheme would be labelled as "do-gooders", but I must apologise on behalf of them for causing an individual such hardship. I mean, we really should have been more considerate of the marginal cost of a passport when considering our institutional privacy!

That aside, it is worth noting that many staff-members at branches are sadly mis-informed about acceptable forms of ID. There will be an "acceptable forms of ID" document contained in the compliance manual (on HSBC's online system), or on the procedures manual if the staff member has an easier time navigating to that. A search on the internal systems for ID &amp; VA tends to work.

Also, management at branches have the power of discretion in these kind of situations, although they will rarely use it.

Can't she just have a photo with the approved wording from the passport site on it with the signature of someone on the list of people who can authorise the photo for passport reasons.

I mean she doesn't have to have the passport, just a photo that would meet passprt criteria on the wording/signature.

We've just returned from the local branch of HSBC, having sat across the desk from one of their people for close on 45 mins doing an application for a credit card with a limit of up to Â£2000. We still have not got a decision from them. They are now saying they would like a notice of coding from HMRC, but as she has no employer and is not drawing an occupational pension, she does not have a tax code.
If they had been setting all these hoops to jump through for me I'd have told them exactly where they could place their credit card.
But its for my mother in law who thought it would be easier as she'd had an account there for 25yrs ++.
So we now heve to wait for a decision to be handed down from the mountaintop.
Bloody HSBC - I've spent less time on a mortgage application. We were both shaking when we came out of there. I guess that's why they invented pubs...
