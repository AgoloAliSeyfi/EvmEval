OK, so I am still learning about how the free market/ global energy supply system works so please correct me if I am wrong, but here is my suggestion;

All state services including social housing, libraries, hospitals, schools, prisons etc should be powered by British energy only and everything the state uses (construction materials, food etc) should be British produced, grown and maintained by a British workforce.

Alongside this, we open up the private sector to imports and freedom of choice, luxuries etc. The private sector can do pretty much whatever it wants but the state must be able to support itself with or without the boom and bust of the private sector.

People who choose to live on benefits (rely on the state) will only have access to British resources also. (British grown) food will be provided for survival as will housing and energy but (imported) luxuries will not be available to those dependent on the state. If people desire luxury, then they must work for it.

The idea being that the state pays (modest) salaries for its workers who consume British energy (retrieving this money through taxes from British workers) and British food/ materials. This would effectively create a system which circulated resources within the country rather than it being channelled out into the hands of Russian billionaires.

The energy will be supplied through wind turbines positioned offshore around the British isles which are maintained by idle military personnel. Further, a production workforce will be employed by the State in factories to produce said materials.

Edit: Why is everyone negging me? I'm trying to offer a solution to a problem.

im actually going to jump to ops defence here, i think that we should be more protective of our industries, like the French and Germans are. For instance, all the French police cars etc are all french made. Granted, because we've pissed all of our industries up the wall, we cant do that with cars, but we can still protect farming?

Farming makes up about 2% of GDP, white it is something we should do more of it is not really something worth actively protecting.

That said, we should stop the French subsidies.

Thorium is a viable nuclear alternative and one which frankly we should already be adopting.

There are aspects of self reliance which would be good but on the whole protectionism is not a good long term policy to follow.

Most of the world's thorium is located in India, thats not going to help Britain if only British sources of energy are to be used.

Which is another reason why protectionism is bad, especially given that solar is only 40% efficient and wind only 25% efficient.

The medium term solution is nuclear and should be Thorium.

Here's a thought. Where does oil and the majority of our gas come from?

You mean like the power plant run in UK by a foreign state owned company (EDF) ? (I never understood how your government ever allowed that but...)
