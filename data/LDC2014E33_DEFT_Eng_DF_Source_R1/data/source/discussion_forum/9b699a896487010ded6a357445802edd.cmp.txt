1) In Chemistry in year 9, I had this completely wet teacher. Bless him, he was jut totally dopey and stuttery and "eh?" like. He had a fish tank in the class, and we would just spend most of the time watching them. Anyway, after the summer holidays, we went back. He told us he had something to announce regarding the fishes, and just about got out that one of them had grown a large tumour, when we turned around and there we saw it - one of the fishes had grown a turban tumour. It was sitting on his head and wobbling while he swam. I had tears streaming down my face and was just managing to splutter out "tumour fish, ahahahahaha tumour fish, tumour fish" - I had to leave the classroom for a wee in case I had an accident. Really awful, but hysterical. It was just this image of this tumour just sitting there jiggling on this poor little fish's head like an accidental hat, it was brilliant.

2) I still hyperventilate whenever I remember this. I have to give you a bit of context first:

My year 11 chemistry teacher was AWFUL. I mean awful. She always wore Christmas jumpers but not cheerful ones, just horrid greying ones with disgusting geometric patterns that showed she actually had no emotion and confirmed the notion that she was in fact a mouldy old hag. She had incredibly awful halitosis, which she would take great pleasure in breathing in people's faces when they asked her a question, or when she was telling someone off. She had a persistent, tinny, whiny voice that rattled straight through your head, cracking a few cells while it was at it. Her intonations were so extreme it was ridiculous. You could hear her highlighting half of her words in italic just for the extra emphasis and the fact that she was clearly trying to be passionate about Chemistry when she was in fact a dull old bitch with grey, greasy hair. She also had such bad furrow lines she looked like a crumpled up carrier bag. And her facial expression never changed. She always had the constant ANGRY SURPRISED look with her eyebrows raised and the McDonalds M shaped forehead wrinkles.
She went mental if anyone EVER interrupted her.

This of course makes what happened even more brilliant.

Bearing in mind I was in triple science and there wasn't enough time in the timetable for the 2 x 3 separate science lessons each week. So we had to have one of our Chemistry lessons on Wednesday after school.

This particular week it had been snowing, and we were watching enviably as the double and single science kids, who had been hanging around school to piss teachers off, were lobbing snowballs at each other.

Anyway, while Ms Porter (oh yes, Ms Porter) was mid sentence and we were just about to nod off, the door just FLUNG open, we heard a squeal of pure joy as it was lobbed and then we see this snowball flying towards her face, which hit her square in the forehead, skidded off her nose and hit the poor unsuspecting Chemistry-geek in the front row.

Oh my. Considering I already have a habit of laughing in appropriate situations, this couldn't have been a worse opportunity. About 40 minutes after everyone had stopped laughing, I was still going and still trying to choke it back - purple in the face with tears flowing, Porter just screamed "GET OOOOUUUUTTTTTT!!!!" and I didn't stop laughing for about a week.

One of my best all-time memories. <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.png"/>

I was in America with my family and gran, and we were about to go on this old train up a mountain. The train started up and was billowing large amounts of sooty smoke into the air. My gran turns to me, chuckles, and goes "We're going to come off that looking like ni-----!"

There was about 5 seconds of stunned silence before I burst out laughing and didn't stop for about an hour. Thank god she said it in the car and not in front of other people!

Another one: this person I worked with was telling me of her trip to Magaluf and how her friend fell off a balcony, which made me laugh as my friend had done something similar. She then goes "it's not funny, he was on the 5th floor and now he's in a coma". I was quivering with laughter. I couldn't help it <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/>

Old men really shouldn't wear them. *shudders*

I just googled "banana hammock". <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/yucky.gif" alt=":yucky:"/>

I tend to find it really funny when people are arguing for some reason.
