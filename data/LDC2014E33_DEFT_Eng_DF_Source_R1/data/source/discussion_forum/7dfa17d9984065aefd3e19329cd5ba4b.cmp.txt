I wasn't aware I was being mean or nasty to you. I can pull up the many compliments and words of support I've been offering you but I don't think I'll find anything mean or nasty.

That is the problem Kit, you can't even recognize the hurtful things you say. Before you ask me to "prove my claims" by copying and pasting them, I am not interested in that argument, I can deal with it. You know when I lost my temper and why I did it. I told you right here on this forum. Don't play coy.

I posted that quote on SFB in a attempt to diffuse a situation that Crow may have started that I did not want. I was making light of the situation by saying I am OK and I can handle myself here on the JREF fine. That is all I intended. It was not a attack on you and it was a mistake to use your name.

I don't believe that not thinking you really saw a 9 x 6 ft monster wood ape amidst the civilization of the Virginia/North Carolina state line qualifies as being mean or nasty. I mean, c'mon. Look at the place we're talking about. An alleged encounter in 1982 first reported in 1998 after a long bout of alcoholism and being discussed 27 years later. I think there is a lot of room for perceptual distortion there but that's just me.

You have made this opinion very clear. I get it.

Your comment at SFB really doesn't seem fair to me.

I understand, but see my above comment.

I'm a little let down that you would speak that way about me when I'm not around. I've liked you since we first got into constructive debate at you SFB and you told Melissa and others to chill out and realize I'm not trying to be insulting or make things personal when I am debating Bigfoot issues.

But you are not around there Kit. You were thrown out for behavior not wanted on that forum by its owner. The fact that you or I may not agree with those rules is not the point. If you want to post there you abide by them.

You have no idea how many times I attempted to defuse the situation regarding you and the rest of the admin. I argued on your behalf on the admin forums constantly. Only for you to turn around and do the same things you were warned about again and again. You took it out of my hands Kit. News flash, If it was not for me you would have been tossed long before you were.

Oh well, I still wish you luck on your road to freedom from irrational fear and nightmares.

Thanks

John, maybe you or someone can pass on to log that despite her little spazzo meltdown flip-off to Serenity.

No Kit, I DO NOT like to pass things from forum to forum, but I was forced to above.

I reject it not only on my opinion, but the opinion of a professional. Please do not expect me to comment on it publicly.

You just did. Hint: If you don't want to talk about things on a public form then don't mention them.
