Hi, since bout a year after I started secondary school I've been getting this shoulder pain. I think it was started by carrying my school bag.
Now I have reached my last year at 2ndry school and my shoulder pain's become really severe. I only get it when I've been carrying a bag (not neccessarily heavy), or am stressed etc. I've been to the drs and got prescribed this cream 'Movelat' bout 1 2 2 years ago. It didn't have any effect, so after my mum not booking me an appointment for AGES <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad"/> she finally did and I got an appointment to c a physiotherapist...

now I went to physio appoint bout 6 weeks ago and the stupid cow didn't seem to believe I actually had anything wrong, or expreienced pain. I hurt my back/shoulder on trampoline bout three to four weeks b4 and, then, my dr said I had tenderthingy or something like that!...? So physio did all the arm movement things to see if I got pain that's usually connected to tenderthingy and I din't have it then, it doesn't usually hurt from moving my arm anyway...

I just really need some sort of advice, has anyone else experienced something like this? Or does anyone know any way I could help it?

Thanks...

I developed shoulder pain from carrying a large purse/book bag, that sustained over a period of approximately six months, but not severe enough to need medication. One of my doctor's main suggestions, aside from putting an end to carrying heavy weight, was to buy a new bed pillow. I was really surprised at how much it actually helped to alleviate the discomfort and pain.

Don't really have any advice to offer, just trying to help. I hope you find some answers.

Years of landscaping, including plenty of stonescaping, has left me with permanent shoulder and collarbone pain. Tia is correct that a proper pillow can really help. I sleep with a large firm pillow that actually puts my upper body higher than my hips.

When my pain is really bad I cannot raise my arms high enough to french braid my hair and I learned an exercise that helps: Stand in a corner of a room, face into the corner, brace your hands on opposite sides of the corner, palms flat on the walls, slowly arch in your back, butt out and press your chest into the corner where the walls meet. Your chest does not touch the walls, you just lean into the place where the walls meet. Hold, straighten and push forward again. If I do this for a couple of minutes it seems to put whatever is out of wack back into place.

The fact that you fell off a trampoline might mean you fractured something. but you would need an x-ray to confirm that.
