Jeb Bush signed the Statement of Principles in June, 1967 along with other RW neo-conservatives who lead us into the Iraq war, economic chaos and the death and injury of thousands of Americans.
Anyone who supports Jeb Bush or any neo-conservative is a fool!

From your link:

<quote>
Our aim is to remind Americans of these lessons and to draw their consequences for today. Here are four consequences:  we need to increase defense spending significantly if we are to carry out our global
responsibilities today and modernize our armed forces for the future;

 we need to strengthen our ties to democratic allies and to challenge regimes hostile to our interests and values;

 we need to promote the cause of political and economic freedom abroad;

 we need to accept responsibility for America's unique role in preserving and extending an international order friendly to our security, our prosperity, and our principles.

I see absolutely nothing wrong with those goals.

I take it that you would suggest quite the opposite?

That's coming along just fucking splendidly so far...

The president and vice-president can't be from the same state.

49-44 does not indicate a strong challenge.

</quote>

If an incumbent is polling behind the challenger then it's a strong challenge. However, as with every other poll threads have been started about regarding 2012, this one is just as irrelevant. The election is two years away so it doesn't matter what the poll says today.

According to usconstitution.net, "A. The Constitution doesn't say that they cannot be from the same state. However, the 12th Amendment does say that electors may not vote for a President from their state and a Vice President also from their state. This issue came up in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_presidential_campaign">2000 presidential campaign</a> when Texas Governor George W. Bush chose fellow Texas resident Richard Cheney to be his running mate. Cheney, who had served in Congress as a Representative from Wyoming, quickly changed his legal residence back to Wyoming to avoid the possible conflict for electors from Texas. Court challenges to Cheney's change of residency were denied.
It is unlikely that two people from the same state would ever be nominated by a major political party. It is constitutionally possible however. If it ever came to pass, the party that won the ticket's state would likely suggest to the electors that their votes for the President go to the presidential nominee and that the votes for the Vice President be given in honor of a party official. Electors in all other states, as mentioned above, would be free to vote for both of the party's nominees."

I don't know if he wants to be a senator. They tried to draft him in the last race but he turned them down.

Nelson's a weak candidate but if the GOP nominates someone weak as well - like they did with that Kathy chick with all the make-up who was responsible for the vote count in 2000 - then Nelson will win.

Jeb is done with politics, I predict. He's making too much money, cashing in from his Governorship. Jeb has always been more about money than politics. He's more like his brother Neil than his father.

Plus, who the hell in his right mind would ever vote for another Bush? Of course, if he did run, the Right-tards here would fawn all over him, swearing that this Bush is a conservative. No...really...he's a conservative...not like his brother...this time it's for real...not like his father...nope...he's the real deal!!! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>
