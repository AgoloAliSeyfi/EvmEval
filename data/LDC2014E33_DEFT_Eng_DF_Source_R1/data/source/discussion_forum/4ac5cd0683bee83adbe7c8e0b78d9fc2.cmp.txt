I'd go and talk to your/his GP. Does he recognise that the water usage is excessive, and is he willing to seek help if he knows that you're running out of patience?

Generally CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) is helpful with cases of OCD but there can be a long waiting list to be seen.

maybe try and spin it around and mention all this cleaning is removing essential bacterial exposure and even tho you are adults can still lead to the real threat of respitatory problems and ashma.
the cost alone of the water would stop me, make sure the money is out of HIS bills.

Talk to his (and your ?) GP. They will give you support so that you are less damaged by the behaviour of your OH, who can't be forced to seek treatment so won't change - or may get considerably worse - until he acknowledges the problem.

I think you are in a difficult situation if he won't admit there is a problem, although I am sure he knows deep down that he is not happy.

I would see if his GP will talk to you. My grandad had OCD and it took him 5 hours to leave the house. His GP immediately put him on Prozac and he was able to reduce the time to 2 hours. Then he felt more able to deal with the problem.

Try to get him to speak to a therapist or something. I know it may be really hard, but he seems to have a very extreme case and it doesn't seem like he will stop anytime soon out of his own accord.

I think you need to sit him down and very calmly tell him you are at the end of your tether. Tell him how you are feeling and what effects his behaviour is having on you. It's a good idea to rehearse this so you can say it calmly and clearly. You also need to make it very clear that you do not feel you can continue to live like this any more and that it's having negative effects on your own health.

I think sometimes the problem with discussions like this is that they become 'heat of the moment' discussions and therefore your OH can dismiss them as emotional flareups rather than deep seated problems. if you take the emotion out of it, this means that the issue itself becomes centre stage rather than the emotions surrounding it.

I think you need to tell him you love and care for him but that you feel strongly now that he needs help. I don't even know if it's worth getting into justifying why you think that - he will know himself in the back of his mind that this is the situation and I don't think you pointing out his problems will necessarily help.

The other thing to think about is that if he won't address the problem he is forcing you to do so. At the minute you are incredibly unhappy. This won't change unless either he changes or you remove yourself from the situation. I think you need to say it to him this bluntly - hopefully it will be enough of a shock to his system to make him think about it again.

It does sound like a really horrible situation!
