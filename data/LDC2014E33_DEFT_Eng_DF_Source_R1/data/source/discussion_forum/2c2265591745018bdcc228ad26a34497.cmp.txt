Aw, Liberal cretins are just pissed because Zimmerman is actually Hispanic. It kinda throws a wrench in their 'Evil Whitey kills Black Kid' Race-Baiting hysteria. Liberal Media Outlets like CNN &amp; NBC are absolutely befuddled as to how to proceed. First they called him 'White' and indicted the entire White Race. But now they're backpedaling and have become distraught. The Liberal Media is a joke. Period, end of story.

Every single person who is assuming Zimmerman should be in jail just because the kid he shot was black.

Come to think of it, that would include you, which might explain why you don't see it. The police report indicated that Zimmerman had a cut on his head, the girlfriend said she heard some type of struggle over the phone before the shots, and there is even a witness that claims he saw that fight. All of that proves that Zimmerman told the police the truth.

What the police have to find out now is if Zimmerman instigated the confrontation. If he did, he should face charges. If he was just following him to make sure he didn't break into a house somewhere in the neighborhood, and Martin actually initiated, and escalated, the confrontation, he shouldn't. Until I know the facts I won't make a decision.

The "fight" was a result of Zimmerman PURPOSEFULLY CONFRONTING MARTIN WITH HIS PREJUDICE IDEALS....IDEALS RECORDED ON THE 911 TAPE.

WTF are YOU babbling about?

</quote>

I am babbling about the facts, something that is strange to you.

Sorry, but your history on these threads demonstrate time and again what a quantum neocon gasbag you are. let's see if you can do better here.

The tape did not record his ideals, he didn't enunciate them to the operator. I have listened to the tapes, and the only slur it is possible to get out of the tape is ambiguous. Even if he said it, and was actually referring to Martin, it doesn't say anything about Zimmerman's ideals, it might. however, be indicative of state of mind.

Are you fucking stupid or just insipidly stubborn? Here gasbag, BS &amp; deny this:

Zimmerman makes all types of assumptions that DON'T coincide with additional information. Given his history of calls on "suspicious" black males that DID NOT PAN OUT, his state of mind is pretty evident....and he DID NOT have to pursue Martin.

What matters is who started the fight, not why it started. If Martin turned around and called Zimmerman a honky and Zimmerman attacked him Zimmerman over reacted. If Martin attacked Zimmerman because he was being followed, he over reacted. Simple statements of fact,

You're simple if you think your supposition and conjecture will pass the muster. Zimmerman INITIATED THE CONFRONTATION, as the tape clearly tells that he PURSUED Martin when it was NOT necessary or prompted by the cops. Referring to Martin as an "asshole" and a "fucking (coon?)" along with his generalize assumptions gives a clear indication of his mindset, whether YOU like it or not.

Why do you hate America so much?

Are you just being a stupid crank with this neocon/teabagger BS? Or are you truly just another libertarian lunkhead parroting your neocon/teabagger cousin's stupidity?

In America we have a thing called Due Process. We do not approve of Lynch-Mobs. I know that bothers you Socialists/Progressives, but that's the way it is. So get over it.

</quote>

Hey genius, "due process" includes PROPER POLICE PROCEDURE....that means you DO NOT just let a man involved in a fatal shooting go scott free without so much as taking them to a precinct for questioning, drug/alcohol test. The call for justice is a call for Zimmerman to be arrested, not "lynched".

Intellectually dishonest libertarians/neocons/teabaggers are quick to distort and misrepresent anything that does not fit into your warped version of life....but the FACTS will always be your undoing. Carry on.

</quote>

The only person in this process whose due process rights are a concern are George Zimmerman's, are you trying to argue the police are railroading him? If not, stop talking about due process.

</quote>

Are you really this fucking dense or are you just being obstinate? Due process means exactly that.....the process of investingation before any charges are actually being done. You shoot someone in a public area when there is serious question as to motive and cause, you should be arrested and taken in for questioning, drug testing, foresnics, etc.

You don't believe in Due Process? Man, you Socialists/Progressives really are lost. Maybe America isn't the place for you? May i suggest China or North Korea? Bon Voyage. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

Due Process begins with proper police procedure, you stupe. As it's evident, the cops in that area didn't even do that! A matter of history, a matter of fact that...which now requires scrutiny by other forces (state and possibly federal).

But do continue to babble like a good little neocon/teabagger/libertarian flunkie....it would be funny if it weren't so pathetic. Carry on.

<img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> You're dumb. Seriously, it's true.

Thanks for proving my point, Pauly. Have the last word, if it makes you feel better. You're dismissed!
