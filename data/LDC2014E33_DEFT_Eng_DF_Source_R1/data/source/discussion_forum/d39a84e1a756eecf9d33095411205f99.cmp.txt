lIGHT WIZARD WROTE:

Re: panzade (Post 3677129)
Certainly there has to be upper class wealthy people who are anti-intellectual (again, exactly what does that mean -- are they actively anti-intellectual are just passively anti-intellectual?) There are also college graduates who might be anti-intellectual but if they went to a specialized school and only learned a profession (like Harvard Business College which still requires at least a modicum of liberal arts courses as far as I know). Is it a reaction to having intelligent students lord over them as being stupid? Could be.

Maybe a new word has to be coined like intelliphobe. After all, most of the so-called anti-intellectual reaction is a fear the intellectuals are in control -- at least of something. What, I'm not sure. Is it the media?

**************************************************************

Lightwizard should read "Neoconservatism" by Irving Kristol.

Kristol writes:

Though a commercial society may offer artists and writers all sorts of desirable things--freedom of expression especially...it did and does deprive them of the status that they feel themselves entitled to. Those who fancy themselves to be intellectuals have always taken themselves to be very important people, and they are outraged by a society that merely tolerates them,,Bertold Brecht was once asked how he could justify his Communist loyalties when his plays could neither be published nor performed. He replied:
Well, there, at least, they take me seriously.

Myself, I continue to doubt that anti-intellectualism, in middle America or elsewhere, exists as a distinguishable ideology. My impression is that this is mostly a projection by eggheads who have the power to coin sociological terms, who feel unappreciated by the riffraff who can't, and who project their feelings onto their putative underappreciators as an ideology.

The obvious alternative -- that in the grand scheme of things, we eggheads are just not as impressive as we think we are, and that the riffraff are only sizing us up realistically -- is too uncomfortable for us to deal with.

It would appear, Mr. Thomas, that you agree in part with the quote from Kristol's NEOCONSERVATISM in my last post.

PQ - Honestly I'm better off from experiencing it firsthand in my life. It's just a tool to manipulate people. I understand its potency. After meeting some of the most brilliant people in my life while being in the Midwest, I do harbor resentment for the way the fly-over-food-states are culturally obscure in the USA..

end of quote.

Really? the fly over food states are culturally obscure???

Well- If one looks at the US News and World Report for the list of best law schools in the USA, we find---Chicago, Northwestern and Michigan as three of the top ten Law Schools in the USA--

Engineering? four of the top ten Engineering Schools in the so-called "flyover" over country--Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Purdue.

Schools of Medicine--Washington U( in St. Louis; Duke; Michigan; Mayo in Rochester.

**********************************************************

All Diest TKo has to do to remedy this state of affairs is to cause these schools to move from flyover country. He can do this by revealing himself as a divine one who, of course, has the most exquisitely tuned sense of MORAL UPLIFT of anyone in the USA.

Don't worry, Mr. Thomas, it does not rub off. You are free to accept whatever part of it you feel is true.

Kristol, of course, is not the man you see on Television often. This is Irving Kristol--His father.

I don't believe there is an answer -- it's the theme of Wells' "Things to Come" and many other socio-political sci-fi writings. The end of the novel is a description of a Theocracy, and the masses revolt. Once again, intelliphobia.

end of quote

I would think that "Intelliphobia" means fear of Intelligence and since the esteemed Mr. Lightwizard decries Intelliphobia it can be safely deduced that he is highly intelligent.

Good for him. It would appear that there is a rough correlation between intelligence and affluence. If this is correct, my thesis on the election of 2008 holds up. Since 75% of the people who had an income of less than $15,000 a year voted for Barack Hussein Obama, it is clear that he derived a large measure of his support from the most stupid part of the electorate.

But how could this be? Only the highly intelligent voted for Obama. Those who did not vote for him are surely the least intelligent.

NOT ACCORDING TO THE EXIT POLLS!!

@Diest TKO,

That's a fantastic art museum in St. Louis, and in the middle of a lovely park, too.
