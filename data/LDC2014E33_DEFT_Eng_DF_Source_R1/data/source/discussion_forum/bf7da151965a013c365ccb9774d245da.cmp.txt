Yeah, he's so bleedin' funny... &lt;grins&gt;

Here's how he sketched the scene of the cabinet reshuffle:

Jonathan Freedland in the Guardian, last Saturday, with a devastating take on the Cabinet reshufffle:

<quote>
<a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/columnist/story/0,,1768946,00.html">'This feels like the beginning of the end'</a>

The local election results were not bad enough to force his immediate ejection, as some had feared (and perhaps others had hoped). But the last 24 hours have brought two signs that the light over No 10 is fading. First came a reshuffle that exposed more problems for the government than it solved. And now the Guardian's revelation of <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labour/story/0,,1768888,00.html">a plot by serious minded and previously loyal MPs</a> - emphatically not the usual suspects - to force Blair into naming the day of his departure. Perhaps the true loyalists around the prime minister still believe he can serve out a third full term, holding onto office till 2009 or even 2010. But if they do, they are the only ones. To most of his party, this feels like the beginning of the end. [..]

He doubtless began the day hoping his reshuffle, the biggest of his career, would soothe the wounds of the night before. But it didn't. Charles Clarke refused to accept a consolation prize, preferring a return to the backbenches and, extraordinarily, publicly disputing the PM's judgement. That must have forced some hurried changes to the game plan.

The result was grumbles all round. Several MPs wonder how sustainable it is for John Prescott to keep his title and salary as deputy prime minister without a department to run: "What will he actually do?" asked Kate Hoey.

Why has Patricia Hewitt kept her job as health secretary? Why has the accident prone chief whip Hilary Armstrong retained a place in the cabinet? What sense does it make to have David Miliband toil away for a year rethinking local government and the cities, only to move him before his work is done to focus on the countryside?

Far from bringing in fresh blood, Blair was forced to recirculate blood that's been in the system a long, long time. No one embodies that better than John Reid, arch-Blairite henchman now elevated to the Home Office - his sixth cabinet post in five years. Reid gives good Newsnight, but rejuvenating he ain't [..].

But the objections to this reshuffle went deeper than that. For nothing about it suggested a prime minister preparing the ground for the "orderly transition" which he himself necessitated nearly two years ago, when he announced that he would not seek a fourth term. More importantly nothing in this reshuffle signalled an eventual handover to Brown at all.

On the contrary, the PM simply dug in, surrounding himself with Blairite ultras. The promotion of Reid, the retention of Tessa Jowell are part of it; but even more provocative was the appointment of Hazel Blears as party chairman. If Blair had a transition in mind, he would have picked a neutral for the job; or even someone allied to Brown, say Douglas Alexander, to smooth the way. He would also have brought on a new generation, giving them precious experience, ready to serve a new administration. Instead the PM selected a team to help him finish the job, rather than to prepare for the next phase of the Labour government.

What he installed yesterday was a Final Days administration.

The great irony is that the conventional sequence of such a day is for a disastrous poll result to be rescued by a sparkling reshuffle. Yet yesterday it was almost the other way around: it was the ministerial rejig, rather than the council elections, which drew attention to the fundamental weaknesses of the government. For on its own, Thursday night was not the disaster it might have been. Labour could have haemorrhaged 400 seats, rather than 250; its share of the vote could have fallen to less than a quarter, rather than 26%.

In the event, Labour could claim to have held firm, not falling below its 2004 local performance, which was followed by a general election win. There were even some gains, Lambeth in London and extra seats in Manchester, Sheffield and Barnsley.

But that was not the mood yesterday. For there was a winner on Thursday and his name is David Cameron. He took his party to the psychologically important 40% threshold for the first time since 1992. It's not yet the national surge the Conservatives need: Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle remain stubbornly Tory-free zones. But gains in London and the south east, in Hammersmith and Croydon, are not to be sneezed at either. As one anxious Labour strategist put it yesterday: "Seats like those, remember, are the New Labour majority."

The Labour party is beginning to see the possibility of defeat, on the distant horizon maybe, but, for the first time in a decade, visible. They are desperate to renew themselves before the voters decide they are clapped out and should be turfed out. They want Tony Blair to get that message - and, if he doesn't listen, some of them are ready to make him.
