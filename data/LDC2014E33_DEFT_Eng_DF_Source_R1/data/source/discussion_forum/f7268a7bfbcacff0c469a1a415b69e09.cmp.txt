Do you even pay attention to current events? Or is Fox News your only source of information? Are you just in denial? Does it make it easier for you to dislike him by deluding yourself into thinking he's done nothing at all?

Here is a partial list:

- The stimulus has created millions of jobs in the PRIVATE SECTOR. Even in light of this recent information, repubs still say it was a waste. Not true.

- The unemployment rate dropped from 12% to 8%. (Yes, it's now at 9%, but obviously we are better off than we could have been).

- Obama has made good on most of his campaign promises (as reported by PolitiFact).

- He has killed/captured 5X as many Al-Queda terrorists in his first 3 years than Bush did in all his 8 year presidency. (Don't believe me? Look it up. In fact, I first learned of this fact on Fox News of all sources).

-there is always churn in the jobs market, even during the depression, I assume you will provide proof that these jobs hes crated in the private sector are- net jobs? Because labor participation rates and the forgotten unemployed don't seem to do it for me....

-not all promises are equal, are they? and those ones he didn't deliver on?

- hummm, so killing T's etc. is a good thing now? I see.

US adds 103,000 new jobs but unemployment rate unchanged

</quote>

Great news isn't it?
But wait there's more

The increase in employment partially reflected the return to payrolls of about 45,000 Verizon telecoms workers who had been on strike in August. The number of unemployed people, at 14 million, remained essentially unchanged in September.

So there weren't 103,000 jobs added to the economy. Someone is cooking the numbers. I wonder who?

Reach Much?

We were promised Unemployment would never go above 8% if we passed the Stimulus. If you think 250,000 Plus per "Job" Created was a good thing, then by all means it was a stunning success.

Unemployment was never 12%, and was lower than it has been under Obama, under Bush.

Made good on his Campaign Promises which ones? Closing Gitmo? Uniting the World? Not Letting Unemployment go above 8%? Being Transparent? Being Bipartisan? WTF are you talking about?

Your Claim that he has killed 3 times as Many Al Qeada is completely False. We killed Thousands under Bush. Besides Obama is continuing Bush Polices that He (Ran Against) in order to kill those Terrorists.

Osama would still be alive if not for Programs Bush Started that Obama called wrong, and Illegal, and then Continued.

You are about as clueless as they come dude. Obama has been a Massive and Utter Failure. Worst Leadership I have ever seen from any president ever. The Current Debt Crisis illustrates his Lack of Leadership For all to see. He thinks he can just come up with a Number and order Congress to figure out how to reach it. He does not have the balls to put his own Numbers on the Table, and suggest how they pay for it. Because he isn't a leader, he is a perpetual Campaigner and chief.

I am wrong about the unemployment rate, but every other point I made about Obama is true. You can claim it's false all you want, but facts are facts. That is the denial that I referred to. Thank you for demonstrating my point. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

When I have more time (tomorrow), I will provide the sources for all of this information.

But really, if you were actually informed on current events, I wouldn't have to.
