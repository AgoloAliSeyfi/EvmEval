They "tolerate" other groups because lgbt is so vocal in trying to stand out. It is also very easy to target and mock. From my experience, it has been a 50/50 mix of people trying to get on with their life and simply wanting equal opportunities, and the other half want to go round dressed as gimps and shouting that they are different. These people cripple any success the more dignified groups had obtained.

I can kind of see where you're coming from, but people seem to think it's okay to mock lgbt people even if they're completely non-stereotypical. I think gay stereotypes are unfortunate as most lgbt people don't really live up to them, and those that consciously (because those that are naturally stereotypically gay as that's how they're most comfortable like metrosexual/camp straight men etc..) adhere to stereotypes perpetrate a negative/unform view of the lgbt community. I agree with you about 'shouting about being different', what do you count as proclaiming difference? Because coming out can be important to losts of people as it's a big burden to get off your chest, lets others know (who may be interested as it can be hard meeting other lgbt people without aid of tacky clubs) and contributed to lgbt visibility, as those who don't conform to the stereotype can change people's prejudice simply by coming out.

But there is nothing that you are willing to do that will rectify the problem. Persecution has always existed, so you would have to implement something utterly new and radical to change human society for the first time.
You also have the problem of choice.
I have known people who were gay the day they were born - as it should be. For what ever reason, the person is gay. Fair enough.
But then you have the gays who have "phases" of being gay, which is simply the person is too insecure to deal with their issues with the opposite sex so decides to be gay. A lot of people will never be comfortable with that choice as it goes against natural instincts.

Hmmm...I think lgbt rights will happen in a similar way to ethnic civil rights. People need to keep campaigning, keep visibilty and portray a positive image of the lgbt community. Progress may be slow, but eventually it will amount to something. I don't think an utterly new radical change is necessarily needed, but if it is, so be it. Societal change isn't always bad, after all. People like that aren't really gay then because as you said, they're not naturally attracted to the same gender, so I'd be somewhat reluctant to put them under the lgbt umbrella. Girls who play bisexual for male attention are just infuriating though, and absolutely demean the efforts and image of lgbt people.

Because I was not taught that and have no problem with the lgbt community. The problem is not in the school, but at the home from parents passing on their bigoted views to their children, or that some kids are just too stupid to accept that people are different.

Fair enough, you're a decent person brought up in a household of liberal values. But we're taught a lot and form a lot of our opinions outside of the homeplace, and so teaching sexual orientations would inform some children and alter their perspectives. Of course, if a child lives in a strongly homophobic environment, it's unlikely to have a huge impact on them (though it may, if they're independant enough), but a lot of parents won't even bring up the issue of sexual orientation at home and so what the child picks up about such is from outside of home. Thus, an lgbt child/teen may not be able to place their feelings/attractions and think of them as wrong/bad if they are uninformed, or informed by a class of peers that mocks lgbt, and teaching sexual orientations at home could improve things.

I think you've made a pretty good point there as it is possible for homosexuals to pass on common genes in other people. I still believe evolution is more focused on the individual rather than the collective but i am willing to accept that point as very valid.

<img src="images/smilies/biggrin.png"/> Why thank you! I would still say that evolution is for a species or population as individuals can't and don't evolve. Therefore it can only apply to a species/population.

Why? It's correct. Being gay does not equal reproductive dysfunction. If you believe that, you are confusing fertility and sexuality.

I wouldn't go out right now and get pregant obviously, but a sperm donor is a definite option in the future

I perfectly understand your point but if it was not possible for people to be inseminated artificially using technology and people didn't understand the fertilisation process would homosexuality possibly hold you back from reproducing?

I said homosexuality (a sexual orientation) is a natural expression of sexual orientation - that's not circular, it's essentially tautological. The qualifier natural, however, could change it from almost tautological to something of actual value.

Yes an appeal to nature.

<quote orig_author="NYU2012">
I realize that, but that doesn't mean something such as sexual orientation does not exist outside of construct. It may a valid question to ask why are we investigating sexual orientation, to which an answer might be along the following: To understand what it is that human sexuality is and what it encompasses.

That's another circular argument I am afraid. <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>
