I apologize for posting this at the last minute, but because of the holidays we had to schedule the production of this episode early, and we just confirmed the guests today.

The next episode of Access: City Hall will shoot tomorrow afternoon so please submit your questions and/or comments by then. Here's the topic:

Host Stu Levitan welcomes Mark Olinger, Director, City of Madison Dept. of Planning and Community and Economic Development, Exec. Director, Community Development Authority; Brad Murphy, Planning Division Director, City of Madison Dept. of Planning and Community and Economic Development; and Matt Mikolajewski, Manager, City of Madison Office of Business Resources, to this episode of Access: City Hall. Theyâ€™ll talk about the Community Development Authority, planning issues, and business and economic development issues.

They'll also address questions and comments that appear here before 3:30 or so tomorrow.

Thanks!

Most parts of Madison have some sort of Neighborhood plan that were in part intended to guide development in a neighborhood. However, a neighborhood plan obviously has no impact who owns any particular parcel of land, and developers can only build on land they own or can otherwise acquire for the project. This oftentimes leads to project proposals that do little to further the goals outlined in the plan, and contentious battles can and do ensue. This in turn leads to frustration and bad feelings on the part of residents, and a reluctance from developers from even proposing projects in the first place. None of these are good for anyone.

My question is how can Madison steer development into what's outlined in the neighborhood plans, and away from projects that are just whatever parcels the developer can assemble?

Thanks, Erik.

As it happens, we won't be shooting until tomorrow afternoon, so there's still time to get involved. The lineup has changed a bit, too. Mark Olinger is still with us, but the other two guests will now be Community Development Division Director Bill Clingan and Bill Fruhling, who supervises the Neighborhood Planning, Preservation and Design Section of the Planning Division.

Feel free to post your questions or comments.

I have a series of related questions:

At the Council Capital Budget meeting on Tueday, Larry Nelson suggested that "a plan is a promise" in reference to the plans of neighborhoods along the proposed CTH M expansion.

1) Do the neighborhood plans along CTH M explicitly call for supporting the level of automobile traffic that the CTH M project is anticipating?

2) How closely does city staff adhere to this policy of "a plan is a promise" for neighborhood plans? What kinds of "promises" are easy to keep, and what kinds are hard to keep?

3) With regard to the other plans the city has adopted - like natual step, the mayor's platinum committee report, the pedestrian plan, etc: What kinds of "promises" are easy to keep, and what kinds are hard to keep?

4) Are there any plans that call for providing development that supports transit? If so, to what extent are those plans adhered to?

While no one likes to see layoffs, given that construction has slowed down considerably in Dane County and does not appear to be coming back anytime soon, shouldn't the city be reducing its staff that was hired over the last decade to handle the now ended building boom? Why are we raising bus fares for poor people when we have an excess in engineers and other building review staff?
