Well, you can't pass a Health Care Bill, in the middle of the night, against the majority of the nation, with little or no input of the other side and expect lines not to be draw-en.

Horseshit. On so many levels.

One, the bill was "against the majority of the nation" only when you combine those who were against any comprehensive health care reform with those who thought the bill wasn't nearly liberal enough.

Two, the only reason there was little or no input from the other side is because the other side refused to offer any beyond "kill the bill."

Three, in spite of the fact that Democrats passed the bill by themselves, it is still from start to finish a Republican bill, lacking every feature that progressives might have preferred (e.g. a public option), and the only reason Republicans opposed it is because they would politically committed to oppose anything and everything.

The Majority is the Majority no matter what. Even under President Clinton when the majority was against that health care bill, it was respected and not passed. Because the majority did not want it. It wasn't forced like this one was.

You didn't watch the committee meetings did you? The majority of Dems killed almost every single bill brought up by Republicans. So their bills did not even get to the floor for a vote at all.
This Health Care Bill is a Democratic Bill all the way, through and through. They own it, it is their baby.

What I'm saying is that there was no majority. A minority of the people wanted a more progressive approach to health-care reform. A minority liked the ACA as written. A minority were philosophically opposed to any significant government involvement. The only way you get a majority is to improperly and deceptively combine the third group with the first one.

That is, not to put it too strongly, bullshit.

I watched some of them, and read about the GOP proposed amendments afterwards. The Republicans knew their amendments would be killed, and intended that they be killed. Those amendments existed only to slow the process down. None of them were serious attempts to improve the bill.

Funny how even a relatively sane and rational Republican like Wiseacre sees Obama as a hard-line, inflexible partisan, while to us on the left he comes across as a totally unsatisfactory limp noodle without a vertebra to his name.

Clearly, Snowe's reasoning doesn't apply to the president (regardless of party) since he is elected by all of the states.

What would you call a President who deliberately called conservatives 'the enemy'? There is no clearer 'partisan' than your messiah.

</quote>

I don't have a "messiah," and if I did he certainly wouldn't be Obama, and I don't recall him calling conservatives "the enemy," and would appreciate a link or citation of him doing so. In context, please.

No...he called the 'private sector' businesses "the enemy".

He has stayed true to his writings.

Anything else YOU want to deflect?

The Republican alternative legislation got a floor vote in the House. It lost 258-176.

In the Senate, those who watched the committee markups were treated to the bizarre show of Republicans opposing their own amendments when the Democrats agreed to incorporate them into the legislation.
