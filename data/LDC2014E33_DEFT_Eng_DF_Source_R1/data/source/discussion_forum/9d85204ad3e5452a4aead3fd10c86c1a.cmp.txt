Besides money and technology, the main thing seperating the US military (all branches) from the rest of the world's militaries is our career personnel. Senior petty officers, Chiefs, NCOs, and SNCOs are not only the backbone of the services, but they are the professional warriors that assure victory and preserves freedom.

The eroding of benefits will affect the quality of the personnel who decide to stay for a career and in turn affect national security. The proposed increase in retirees health care payments is a kick in the nuts of those who made decisions to stay past 20 years based on future benefits.

People who compare a military career to the toils of life in the union shops of America are only fooling themselves. There is no comparison. The number one constitutional mandate is national security. Caring for those that fullfill that requirement must be accomplished and without whining, crying, and comparing my 26 years to your tough life in the union.

Precisely why this regime needs to be voted out in November. We saw the same BS under Carter and Clinton. All the Dems do is shit on us and our families. See you in the commissary on Sunday Senior....

Actually, shopping seems to go a lot faster now. I like the way they have it laid out - frozen stuff last. Remember a few weeks ago, before they had produce open and the new entrance - you started off with frozen stuff. I didn't like that arrangement at all.

The military is voluntary. Nobody is forced to join. You know you are going to "get shot at" when you join. Same with police officers. Firefighters know they are going to run into burning buildings.
But, how much subsidies are "enough"? If someone goes into the military for 3 years are we then supposed to keep that person for the rest of their life? Pay everything from healthcare to their car and mortgage? At what point does the military and perks become something beyond what it is intended and not just another govt dependency plan? None of us have issues with treating our military or soldiers well. We want the best possible equipment and gear and good pay. But, i see politicians using the Military in a way and trying to turn them into another govt dependency group.

You sure didn't join up for the good food and no 18 year old kid worries about a medical plan. Maybe you forgot about patriotism. Personally I'm sick of Veterans whining about lost benefits. Get a freaking job that furnishes benefits like I did.

This was a very ignorant statement, you should be ashamed of yourself. I know your momma raised you better than this.

Mortage? Car Payment? wtf are you going on about. The military doesnt pay for that. You get a pension and health care, only after serving 20 years or more. Less than that all you get is VA benefits.
