It doesn't sound like he killed people simply because they were white.

The irony here is that if it had been a white man killing black people with the same circumstances, you would have made it a racial issue, Ravi....no doubt about that.

Your stereotypes run deep, don't they?

I thought I was pointing out your stereotype, Ravi. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_whistle.gif"/>

"You probably want to know the reason why I shot this place up," Thornton said.

"They treat me bad over here, and they treat all the other black employees bad over here too. So I just took it into my own hands and I handled the problem," he said.

"I wish I coulda got more of the people."

The guys a real idiot.
I mean, why did he kill himself? I'm sure eric holder would have had all the charges against him dropped.

Sounds like this nutter was racially motivated to be sure.

But the primary issue here is that he was a nutter who decided to kill people who pissed him off.

What motivated him to target Whites is actually not all that important.

Nutters often target one group or the other.

Woman are the most targeted demographic by serial murderers, regardless of race.

And coworkers (also regardless of race) are the people most frequently targeted in work-related mass killing events like this.

If the place had been manned by Black people?

It's entirely possible this nutter would still have killed everybody he could find.

We'll never know, really.

Maybe the White people drove him crazy at work, but I kinda doubt it.

He was nuts first.

His targets (and his stated motivation) are just based on who was around him to become targets would be my guess.

In this guy's case?

It was White people he could blame, and therefore attempt to justify his murderous urge.

Co-workers are often the targets in work-related murders? Sorry, for some reason it's funny that was pointed out.

He was just a disgruntled common thief who got caught stealing beer (on video), got fired, mass murdered, who happened to be black.

Yet the majority of the MSM totally underplayed the racial angle, for reasons everyone by now understands: the killer was black, and the victims were white. My own local newspaper made absolutely no mention of the racial element in the small brief it ran. But given that race was what (rightly or wrongly) drove the entire incident, the medias censorship of this is a gross dereliction of duty.

His own words indicted him as a racist.

He was a thief and got caught so he decided to exact retribution against all of those racists he didn't like.

</quote>

Actually, he was more playing the VICTIM, the MARTYR.

Regardless of why he did it, I still don't see how thinking other people treated one in a racist manner makes one a racist.

You have to open your mind to the distinct possibility that accusations of "racist" against whites themselves come from the racist motivations of non-whites.

I know, you have to connect a few dots there.

But that's what's going on.

Maybe but when a guy goes off and kills a bunch of People and after the Fact he and his Family say it was because of Racism. when that Person never reported any such problems to his Job or Union. You have to wonder if maybe this is not one of the "rare" times.

only 4 eh, well lest see blacks are 11% of the population. So 7 would have been an exact Fair representation of Blacks to white with 69 total Employees. 4 is low but not terribly so.
