Once the GOP primaries are over, the election begins in earnest.

What will Republicans run on?

America knows who wrecked the economy.

That Republicans hid the cost of the wars from the country.

That the bulk of the deficit comes from the Bush tax cuts, the "drugs for votes" bill and the unnecessary war.

Bush and the Republicans held both houses and the presidency for six straight years. They have nothing to be proud of during that entire time. In fact, they even let Bin Laden go.

You can't run on, "We have to get Obama out of office because he (and then name Republican failure)". This isn't the "Reagan Legacy Project". People remember who did what.

There is a strategy called, "Just that one fact alone".

Obama took us out of Iraq, just that one fact alone.....

Obama saved the auto industry, just that one fact alone.....

Obama got Bin Laden, just that one fact alone.....

Obama made it possible for people to insure their collage age children, just that one fact alone....

Obama helped extend unemployment for suffering Americans, just that one fact alone....

Republicans can't use that strategy. It would backfire.

There were no WMD's. Just that one fact alone....

Republicans helped the Chamber of Commerce to move millions of jobs to China. Just that one fact alone....

A Republican apologized to BP. Just that one fact alone....

Republicans did nothing for those Katrina survivors. Just that one fact alone.....

Republicans say disaster victims low priority. Just that one fact alone....

See how this is a strategy that will work for Obama but not for Republicans.

So please, someone explain to me what they will run on. Once you hit the general election, the truth will come out.

Wow. Just wow.

Here it is years later and according to Democrats, it is still Bush's fault. Here it is years after voters turned over control of two branches of government to Democrat control and Democrats are still insisting that they still aren't responsible for a FUCKING THING!

Sorry -but you whackos are just that. Really, really whacko. Get a clue -it is hard to insist the fault even YEARS later lies with the out of power party honey. Maybe that bullshit still sells in nutjob land but not among normal people.

I'm not even going to address the stupid idiotic crap you wrote -there is no point. I'm still trying to grasp the mentality that will not only say but BELIEVE it when they say even when Democrats have super majorities and total control of two branches of government meaning they have no brakes at all, had no reason to compromise with Republicans over anything and didn't and even years later -they still aren't responsible for a FUCKING THING. NOT EVER. Oh sure. And apparently this really works for some which speaks volumes about who are their natural constituents and base. Sorry -I'm truly just not stupid enough to be a Democrat. I can't read stupid shit like this because there is no intelligence behind it.

You are absolutely correct. There is no point. It's not like it can be denied.

Obamacare. Just that one fact alone will be used against Obama.

Also, Obama said he should be held accountable if he did not get the economy going. Well, unemployment is still in the crapper, and if it still is in November, that one fact alone will sink him.

Yea, because health care for Americans is so bad.

Ron Pauls Campaign Manager Died of Pneumonia, Penniless and Uninsured

And so, what started in February 2007 with one laptop in Snyder's Arlington, Va., apartment, quickly grew into a $35 million campaign employing 250 people. In the fourth quarter of that year, Snyder raised a stunning $19.5 million for Paul  more than any other Republican candidate had raised at the time.

*The Kansas City Star quoted his sister at the time as saying that a "a pre-existing condition made the premiums too expensive."

Despite Pauls insistence that charity is the appropriate response to Americas uninsured crisis, Snyders friends raised $34,870.53, far short of the $400,000 necessary to pay his bills.

---------------------------------------------

So that's the Republican Plan? The tax payer should foot the bill. Wow, how "FREE!"

I want to see Republicans run on this.
