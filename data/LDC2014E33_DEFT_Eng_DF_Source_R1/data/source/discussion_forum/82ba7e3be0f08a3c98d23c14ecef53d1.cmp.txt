Rant of the day? Who's got a better one?

I would like to thank you for proving my point. Corporatism? Gramm-Leach-Blilely?
Nope.
Just as your ThoughtMasters told you to do!

Thanks! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/clap2.gif"/>

You and others like you have proven beyond all doubt that it is a waste of time to reply to liberal rants.

The liberals are running (and ruining) this country.

Liberalism is a fucking mental disorder!

If we could only learn from our mistakes! Let's review:
2001 a federal budget surplus.

Then tax cuts for the rich, two wars fought on credit borrowed from the Chinese.

Then deregulation of the banking system and Wall Street.

gee. I wonder which policies really screwed the pooch? Maybe we should run right back to the Conservative policies that squandered the surplus, reduced revenues by cutting taxes for those who are most comfortable and borrow from our economic competition to pay for wars we should never have fought in the first place. Or we could poke sharp sticks in our eyes. Either way makes as much sense as the other.

More left wing bull crap. There was no surplus, Clinton played with the numbers and Newt balanced the budget.

You wouldn't know the truth if it mattered to you.

OWS has captured the attention and participation of the entire world.
This is indisputible. They have a LOT of very legitimate concerns but
FOX, the RW e-media etc... have enslaved the minds of Conservatives,
much in the way of the book "1984".

Do NOT pay attention to the evidence! WE will tell you what to think.
WE will tell you your opinions.
This has been evidenced in other threads.

So when an Occupier says "We object to the level of influence afforded
Corporations and Special Interest Groups by Citizens United!"
A Conservative will reply as they have been instructed with something
like "You poop on streets!"
Notice how the issue is avoided and the need for Independent thought
is eliminated? Conservatives are simply not equipped to deal with the
ISSUES that OWS has brought up, so they parrot what they have been
taught.
The ISSUES?
* WE DON'T WANT TO END CAPTIALISM, WE want to end the Corporatacracy
and restore our Democratic Republic. For every hour a senator or
congressman spends with a citizen who has a legitimate concern, they
spend over 100 with a lobbyist, CEO or UNION LEADER (Oh Damn, that
eliminates the "Change the Subject Tactic that Conservatives use when
they can't address issues directly!). There is no voice of the people.
Anyone thinking our government is not run by money, is a fool.
* No more bank bailouts. This includes Fannie May and Freddie Mac, btw
(Oh Damn, that eliminates the "Change the Subject Tactic that
Conservatives use when they can't address issues directly!).
* Stop giving money belonging to We the People, away to the corrupt
politicians of foreign governments.
* No more subsidies or tax breaks to any company that doesn't hire
100% American, attribute their income 100% in America and pay their
taxes 100% in America.
* Reverse "Citizen's United" and put elections back in the hands of
The People.
* Repeal Gramm-Leach-Bliley (Like Newt Says!).

Those are just some of the ISSUES. How will Conservatives respond to
the issues? We all know. Dodge, change the subject, Project What they
Have been Instructed to Believe etc... Well
guess what Conservs. The Tea Party didn't promote ending the intereference of
religion in politics. They're overwhelingly old and Conservative. OWS is
overwhelmingly Young and Liberal. So duh. Gee. Go figure. Just a tactic to dodge
the issues they bring up. Replace them with your own.

But Conserv won't address these issues. Their ThoughtMasters have told them
not to...
