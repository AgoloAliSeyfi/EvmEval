The political dust is far from being settled in Thailand.

Apr 19, 2009 BANGKOK, THAILAND  The charred buses and metal barricades are gone. Armed soldiers still patrol the capital, but discretely. Even the traffic is back to its usual near-gridlock.

But one week after Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejajjiva declared a state of emergency to put down violent protests here by red-shirted opponents, who sought his resignation, the shock waves are still rippling through a polarized, shaken nation.

The emergency laws were reaffirmed Sunday after a meeting between security officials and the prime minister. It may be several days before its lifted. Police are hunting for the gunmen behind the shooting on Friday of Sondhi Limthongkul, a leader of a rival protest group, known as yellow shirts.

Authorities have separately detained 34 people over the recent protests and closed down opposition radio stations and Internet sites blamed for inciting violence.

Beyond the immediate security threat, however, lies a more complex challenge: restoring faith in Thailands fragile democracy to solve its grinding political conflict. If this fails, the outcome could be more turmoil and greater instability, say political analysts and politicians.

FRESH ELECTIONS?
Much of the debate centers on proposed changes to a 2007 constitution and a possible amnesty for banned politicians, followed by fresh elections. There is deep disquiet over the role of powerful elites, including the military, in the process, as well as the risk of a popular backlash to any poll results.

Mr. Abhisit, who took power in December after a court disbanded three parties in the previous coalition government, has promised to hold elections, once political reforms are concluded. But he hasnt laid out a firm timetable for the reforms, which experts have said could take several months to finalize.....

While I wouldn't endorse the idea of going to Thailand now, your friend will be fine, so long as he/she doesn't stray off the tourist/mainstream path. Protest zones should obviously be avoided. I think all the chaos took place in Bangkok &amp; not anywhere else in Thailand. Things seem much calmer now but you never know.

It has been quite a long emergency decree, 12 days. It has now been lifted.

But there is another summit in Thailand in June. There may be trouble there again.

BANGKOK, April 24 (Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva lifted a state of emergency in Bangkok on Friday and promised constitutional reforms in the latest bid to resolve the country's long-running political crisis.

Abhisit announced the decision in parliament after a late-night debate on violent anti-government street protests and officials said the decree would be formally lifted later on Friday.

"The official end of the decree has to be published in the Royal Gazette, which officers are working on right now," Satit Wonghnongtaey, a minister of the prime minister's office, told Reuters.

Emergency rule was imposed in the capital and surrounding areas 12 days ago to quell violent street protests involving thousands of demonstrators intent on toppling the government.

Two people were killed and more than 100 injured in the worst street violence in 16 years, threatening further damage to the key tourist industry and Thailand's recession-bound economy....

The emergency measures barely affected daily life in the city of over 10 million people. Abhisit said protests could resume as long as they were peaceful.....

Abhisit, who has previously rejected a new poll, proposed a new commission to study amendments to the 2007 constitution, which was drafted by a military-installed government after Thaksin was removed in a coup a year earlier....

Critics have said the constitution was a step back from the 1997 "People's Charter", which allowed for a fully elected upper house.

BANGKOK, April 25 (Reuters) - About 3,000 supporters of exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra gathered in Bangkok on Saturday for their first rally in the capital since violent street clashes two weeks ago.

Security was tight with 450 police monitoring the crowd of red-shirted protesters at Sanam Luang, a public square near Bangkok's Grand Palace.

"The protest is going well so far. No violence," Police Major General Suporn Pansuea told Reuters.

Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva ended a 12-day state of emergency in the capital on Friday,...

A leader of the pro-Thaksin United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD) said the rally would be peaceful and end around midnight.

"Our request is the same. We want the Prime Minister to quit," Somyos Prueksakasemsuk said.

The UDD plan more rallies in the provinces before returning to Bangkok for a large demonstration in May, he said....
