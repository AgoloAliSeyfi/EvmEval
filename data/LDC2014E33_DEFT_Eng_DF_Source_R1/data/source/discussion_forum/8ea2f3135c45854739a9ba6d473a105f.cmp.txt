Okay, Lumpy, I'm ready now. I'm ready to start listening to what people have to say good for the guy.

Has anyone been saying anything good about him? More specific than how smart he is? I haven't been paying attention to the whole thread. Lotsa noise in it. But if you have, could you summarize the high points?

What does Newt plan for the nation starting in 2013?

I'm ready to listen! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

I was kinda asking for the beefs, there's beefs a plenty... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

I haven't read the whole thread. I did notice a theme of whining about his marital problems which seems odd to me coming from liberals. They seem to want to keep Republicans on a moral pedestal so that they can simultaneously tear it down.

I think Democrats have been successful in down grading religious faith and morals down to a bigots paradise. They use religion as a weapon..it just not appropriate..

Sorry I can't summarize the high points...Sharks &amp; NY Islanders starts in 15 minutes..

If I had more time I'd figure it out but I suspect hypocrisy and liberal forked tongue desperation played a large part...ole Buddy...

You never heard of Clarke, but that's because you're not particularly well informed.

There's a record of Clarke attempting to get the Bushies to pay attention to bin Laden. They held a meeting, FINALLY, shortly before 9/11. Bush received a memo shortly before 9/11 called

</quote>

That would be the same memo that called a hijacking plot NOT credible. In fact, Bush rightfully said after that breifing that gave him no new information, "Well, you've covered your ass."

Clark was a non-entity in an administration that just saw terrorism as a way to take attention away from bimbo eruptions.

This is mind blowingly stupid. Do you remember 9/11? Do you grasp that Clarke and Clinton were right about bin Laden, and Bush and Condi were wrong?

We nominated Kerry because he voted for the war? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Well, you could have nominated Howard Dean, who was against the war from the get-go. You didn't. Because you didn't want to appear weak. And you thought a manufactured war hero would give you credibility. Oh, wait. He got those purple hearts for minor injuries and then hung around with Jane Fonda after the war....OOOOOOOPS.

We nominated him because we thought he had the best shot.

I live in America. A place with freedom of speech, and that freedom of speech has helped to secure your liberty.

<quote>
The only thing that secures my liberty is that there are big, burley men with guns ready to do violence on my behalf--- to paraphrase George Orwell. The ability of liberal morons to say stupid things is just an annoyance.

Bullshit. Reality is over your head.

By far the best debater and most informed candidate and could easily kick Obama's ass in a debate...

Turned Clinton from a deficit spending President in a fortunate economy to a budget surplus and Democrat pro-sexual harassment hero..

Soo.. what's your beef with this Guy...?

I started my own thread for high points instead of beefs.

But it was royally hijacked. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/tongue.gif"/>

Hope it's a good game!
