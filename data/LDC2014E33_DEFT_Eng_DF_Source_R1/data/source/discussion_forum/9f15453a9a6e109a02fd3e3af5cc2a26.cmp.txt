Another denier "faint hope" theory postulating a negative feedback for clouds bites the dust.....and reaffirms the models.....through observation of the predicted effect.....

Cloud 'Feedback' Affects Global Climate and Warming

ScienceDaily (Dec. 10, 2010)  Changes in clouds will amplify the warming of the planet due to human activities, according to a breakthrough study by a Texas A&amp;M University researcher.
Andrew Dessler, a professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences, says that warming due to increases in greenhouse gases will cause clouds to trap more heat, which will lead to additional warming. This process is known as the "cloud feedback" and is predicted to be responsible for a significant portion of the warming over the next century.
Dessler used measurements from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instrument onboard NASA's Terra satellite to calculate the amount of energy trapped by clouds as the climate varied over the last decade. He also used meteorological analyses provided by NASA's Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.
"It's a vicious cycle -- warmer temperatures mean clouds trap more heat, which in turn leads to even more warming," Dessler explains. His work is published in the Dec. 10 issue of Science magazine and is supported by a NASA research grant.
While climate models had long predicted that the cloud feedback would amplify warming from human activities, until recently it was impossible to test the models using observations.
"This work suggests that climate models are doing a pretty decent job simulating how clouds respond to changing climates," Dessler says.

Oh you mean like that Astronomy professor from LSU? The one that was telling students they could expect a 4-10 degree increase in their lifetime?

It's funny how when alarmists are threatening catastrophe...

You think 4-10 degrees (Fahrenheit presumably) would be catastrophic?

... and quoting extreme high end effects, like doubling CO2 in 60 years suddenly it isn't "pointless".

</quote>
Taking pre-industrial CO 2 load as ~280 ppm, double would by 560-570 ppm. An average of 3ppm per year for 60 years would about get us there.

You think that would be catastrophic?

It's a double standard and it has no business in a scientific discussion.

I haven't followed this particular exchange closely : who brought it up?

New Negative Feedback Discovered

A new NASA computer modeling effort has found that additional growth of plants and trees in a world with doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide levels would create a new negative feedback  a cooling effect  in the Earth's climate system that could work to reduce future global warming.

Interested parties may want to read the fine print in this article and take note of the fact that this model actually predicts a 1.7 degrees (C) increase in average global temperature upon doubling CO2.

So we've got what, about 150 years to avert this "disaster"? I'm still not seeing the reason to jack up my fuel bills and sanction third world countries for using cheap energy to industrialize their nations.

One paper, from NASA, based on computer modelling, and you wrap yourself in it. Good to see you're on-board with NASA and computer modelling now.

On a side note I see the Climate conference in Cancun is seeing record low temperatures today. Oh the irony of it all.

</quote>
Where did you see that? Are you quite sure these are record low temperatures? And do you have photos of the local weather-stations?

(I'm being ironic, by the way.)
