I can't understand how anyone could be so lacking in common sense as to believe that Newt Gingrich could ever be elected president.

I sense fear from your lash out rant. Obama, "the manchild", would lose big in a one on one debate with ol' Newtie. No contest. He can't hide his gaffes, his hypocrisy on issues, his scandals on fast and furious, cronie capitalism on solyndra/sunpower/and his failed Keynesian approach to our economy. That alinsky/cloward-piven crap is running out of time.

I think michele should make a trip to target and stock on crybaby blankets and kleenix.

Is Newtie still in favor of Cap &amp; Trade? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_shhh.gif"/>

I'd be in favor of capping you, and trading you in for someone with a brain. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/clap2.gif"/>

This is mind blowingly stupid. Do you remember 9/11? Do you grasp that Clarke and Clinton were right about bin Laden, and Bush and Condi were wrong?

<quote>
I would say everyone was wrong about Bin Laden. But Clinton had eight years to do something substanive about the guy, from when the first WTC attack happened, to the bombing of USS Cole. And he did nothing. He let the guy walk out of the Sudan (after the Sudan had offered to turn him over) and into Afghanistan.

Bush on the other hand, wiped out most of his network, toppled the two regimes that Clinton said was aiding him (Iraq and Afghanistan) froze his assets, captured or killed most of his key subordinates. To the point that all he had left at the end was a house and his porn stash where he lived cowering in fear.

No. Everyone wasn't wrong about bin Laden. Clarke was right. Bill Clinton was right. George Bush was wrong before 9/11. The people you're citing who attacked Clarke were wrong. They complained that Clarke kept coming in with his hair on fire---which means that he grasped the reality of the problem BEFORE 9/11. But in order to defend Bush, the right has been forced to attack Clarke for being overzealous...instead of having some degree of honesty and admitting that when Clarke's hair was on fire, Clarke was right.

Clinton was obsessed with bin Laden to the point that he was criticized for it.

As for Clinton passing on bin Laden, are you determined to bring up every right wing myth in existence in this thread? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

We nominated him because we thought he had the best shot.

<quote>
Really? Doesn't that say something about you guys, then? You don't stand by your principles, you comprimise them because you want to win. Which is, of course, why you lost.

</quote>

Yes, it says that we are not rigid ideologues.

As for 'why we lost', that's pretty funny. Look at the crop of candidates that the Pubs have this go round....please, don't compromise your principles. Nominate Newt, and let him go down in flames. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_pray.gif"/>

Clarkes story changed depending upon the audience. That was clearly proven.

Alright back to your rant. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Actually, the only person who supported the "Clarke was a prophet" BS is clarke. A guy who we already caught lying when he said Condi Rice didn't know what Al Qaeda was when she talked about it during several interviews in 1999 and 2000. Therefore, nothing he said was believable.

</quote>

You have a problem with attacking the person with hyperbole rather than with facts. Thus, you feel you can dismiss Clarke by personally attacking him, dismiss Hill by claiming her students were bored, for example.

That's an illogical way to approach what we're talking about.

Clarke's story is backed up by the record. He asked for meetings on al Qaeda, repeatedly. We know that no meeting occurred, in spite of his asking for months, until shortly before 9/11. We know that the people who dismissed Clarke as having his "hair on fire" were wrong. We know that Clarke was right.

Clarke was right. Condi was wrong. Give the man credit.

<quote>
Clinton did nothing about Bin Laden. Come to think of it, that was pretty much his whole presidency, he just talked and talked and talked. And took credit for the work of others. Kind of like the Affirmative Action President.

You're denying the reality of the record with more personal attacks on the person we're discussing.

Why, Newt doesn't represent where most of the party is right now. If we nominated a guy who was closest to where the rank and file is on the issues, we'd nominate Perry or Cain.

Not that it matters, though. The Affirmative Action President is going down.

</quote>

So you're saying that you're not going to nominate Perry or Cain? As a prediction, I mean. Who's going to be the nominee?
