OK, be branded for the liar you are.

A new paper exposing the myth of 70s global cooling
Over time, William Connelly has been steadily documenting 70s research predicting global cooling. It's a rich resource but as he admits, could be more accessible. Now he has collaborated with Thomas Peterson and Jr the liar you are.ohn Fleck to publish The Myth of the 1970's Global Cooling Scientific Consensus, due to be published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.

The paper surveys climate studies from 1965 to 1979 (and in a refreshing change to other similar surveys, lists all the papers). They find very few papers (7 in total) predict global cooling. This isn't surprising. What surprises is that even in the 1970s, on the back of 3 decades of cooling, more papers (42 in total) predict global warming due to CO2 than cooling.

And just wait till you see what they have to say about the business of global warming orthodoxy 40 years from now.

40 years from now they will be talking about the assholes that could not recognize reality and prevented even preperation for consequences. And what they say will not be complimentary.

Yeah, and 40 years ago some assholes with an agenda or a buck to make said the same thing about anyone who wasn't 'sure' we'd all be under glaciers by now. Chumps like you are nothing new.

LOL!!! Logic is now a "thought processing error"?!?! Sorry, AGW has been proven. The only questions remaning are "when" and "how bad".

</quote>

Sorry to have to call you a liar konradv, but alas, you are a liar. AGW has not been proven. In fact, it has not even been elevated to the level of a theory. AGW remains a piss poor hypothesis lacking a single shred of hard, observable, repeatable evidence that provides a hard link between the activities of man and the changing climate.

I already showed you that there has been no decrease in outgoing LW radiation since 1970 according to the satellite record in spite of a marked increase in atmospheric CO2. The facts simply don't support the AGW claims.

But once again, if you believe there is proof that provides a hard link between the activities of man and the changing climate or that there is anything going on in the climate today that is outside the boundries of natural variability, feel free to post your proof.

By the way, a claim that it has been posted rather than an actual posting will only tend to reinforce my claim that you are a liar.

So says an anamous message board poster. In the meantime, all the Scientific Societies in the world, all the National Academies of Science, and all the major Universities state AGW is a fact and a clear and present danger to all of us.

Oh, who to believe??????????????

I know when one side tries to shut down the debate saying there is a consensus, they're lying.
I know when the only solution is to spend trillions for minimal, unproven benefit, I know the liar is a leftist.

Indeed and well put.......but no worries here. These people are losing in sound fashion. The reason? They never want to face answering the question, "At what cost?". Fortunately for the majority.........they do the math, and we dont have to worry about these fuckkers fubaring the future of our kids.
