Obamabots believe Obama doesn't lie.

Reality, of course, disagrees.

I'm shocked he was even elected...

I've been familiar with Obama since the 90's and the platform he ran on in 08 was nothing but lies...

The guy is a lying racist elitist communist...

Apparently the majority of who voted for him didn't read "Dreams From My Father" or even bothered to check his voting history...

I would certainly label him a narcissist or a psychopath. Everything he does is to keep his power base. He doesn't care about anyone but himself - As a matter of fact I believe hes obsessed with himself...

This dickhead threw his own mother under the bus who raised him then praised his drunk communist father (which he only met a few times) to score brownie points with self loathing white progressives.

Now, now, the press asked him some pretty hard-hitting and no-nonsense questions like: "So, Senator Obama...just exactly how awesome ARE you, anyway? The people have a right to know!"

It's worse in Chicago - you'd think the guy was the second coming...

The Chicago Tribune worships the ground he walks on (or any progressive for that matter) while they degrade any republican they can..

It's a shame, such a great state as IL saddled with that shithole of corruption. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cry.gif"/>

The non-partisan assessment on Obama's campaign promises:

<a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/">PolitiFact | The Obameter: Tracking Obama's Campaign Promises</a>

Article explaining the success of Obama's stimulus in creating millions of jobs:

<a href="http://www.examiner.com/liberal-in-national/cbo-states-obama-economic-stimulus-created-or-saved-5-million-or-more-jobs">CBO states Obama economic stimulus created or saved 5 million or more jobs - National liberal | Examiner.com</a>

</quote>

It figures. "national liberal"..The CBO...Now there's two entities that have zero interest in keeping Obama in the White House.
Politifact is a liberal blog.

</quote>

ah the this cite is bias and the CBO doesnt jive with my opinion right now so i wont use it.

</quote>

Here's the problem, you walking obscenity, it is NOT opinion. It's fact.
There is no possible way the CBO's or any of the various blogs cited numbers here can work. The federal government's own unemployment figures and the current condition of the housing and other consumer markets belie any published numbers handed out by the Left, the White House or CBO.
So go ahead and process that for a while.
I for one would be thrilled to see unemployment lowered, more people making money. That increases economic activity which stimulates business activity which translates to prosperity.
The current presidential administration will not let that happen.

I think my favorite question for President Obama was, "Who is you favorite White Sox player?" Not because of the question, but because of the answer.

"I, uh... Well... um... That's... Uh... you know... I like the Cubs too!"
