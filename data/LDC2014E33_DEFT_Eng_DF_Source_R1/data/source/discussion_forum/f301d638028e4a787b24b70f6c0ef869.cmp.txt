You haven't done this at all. The internet is full of sources showing women have been raped in the military.

You see no reason to doubt the statistics... You're actually telling me that you believe one in every three females serving in the US forces have been raped? That 2 in 3 have been sexually assaulted, and that practically all of them have been subject to harassment? For crying out loud...

I don't have an agenda, I'm just sick and tired of the military being portrayed as being a bunch of sick, animalistic goons. I don't care whether they're American or not.

Oh, so 40 women claim to have been raped or abused. That disgusts me, and is an accusation I take very seriously, certainly a lot more seriously than the author of the book, who just seems to take it as further proof that all men are scum. According to the BBC, that well known font of truth and knowledge, 206,000 women have served in Iraq. Suddenly, 40 doesn't seem such a high number, and I'd wager that number is a lot lower than you'd find on civvy street. Before you say 'Oh, but surely more than 40 have been raped/sexually assaulted/looked at for more than 3 seconds' - prove it. Find me the exact statistics about how many women have been proved to have been raped or assaulted. Not hearsay, not 'my mate was in another company and he said that a bloke he knew heard it from another bloke' crap, actual DoD figures.

It happens - I've never disagreed with that. It's a terrible, terrible thing, but it happens, and steps are taken to prevent it. Trouble is, the US Forces are so concious about it that they impose all these rules and regulations, which facilitate it. It just doesn't happen on the grand scale the man-hating author so fondly imagines. I'd put money on the instances of actual rape/assault/harassment occurring far less than occurs outside the military.

The scope of the problem was brought into acute focus for me during a visit to the West Los Angeles VA Healthcare Center, where I met with female veterans and their doctors. My jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41% of female veterans seen at the clinic say they were victims of sexual assault while in the military, and 29% report being raped during their military service. They spoke of their continued terror, feelings of helplessness and the downward spirals many of their lives have since taken.

From the Pentagon-

<quote>
The Pentagon released a disturbing report Tuesday on sexual abuse in the military, saying that more than 2,900 sexual assaults were reported last year, up nearly 9 percent from the year before. Nearly two-thirds of the cases involved rape or aggravated assault.

It's clearly obvious the rape rates are very high.

You can't compare a job in which someone shagging someone they shouldn't could lead to bad decisions leading to injury or death or other tragic incidents with a normal 9-5. You might get picked for a few **** jobs just because the boss is screwing your attractive colleague, but it's unlikely to put you in serious danger. Get over yourself.

No. You get over yourself (and get back to the Sea Cadets or whatever it is you do when you're not playing with your Action Man dollies)
