And Glenn Beck has the way to improve upon all those evils? Uh huh... He perpetuates hatred, period. If it were all about losing our "honor" over the past several years, why wasn't someone who exemplifies that "honor" asked to speak? Why not someone like General Patreaus or Rick Warren? Or both? I know I would love to hear speeches from them about restoring honor and dignity, and September 12th would have been the perfect day. But Sarah Palin? Puleeze. This whole rally is political in nature, just shy of the midterm election 2 months away. It's a fucking smokescreen to rev up the tribe and get radicals elected.

another dumbass. i love it. where was anything political mentioned at the rally? Ive watched the whole thing and all that is spoken about is love for the founding principles, love for our veterans, the honorable gift of charity, and sacrafice that made america free. If you take issue with that, then you are the one who is full of hatred. get a clue.

So you really believe anyone attending intends to vote for a Democrat? Or approves of Obama? Gullible-itis has become epidemic.

I didn't watch the rally.

But I didn't have to, to know Maggie is only another wingnut prone to pulling her opinion out of her ass and waving it around as "fact."

I haven't stated any "facts" here at all; only opinions. But I don't expect someone as dumb as you to see that.

Restoring Honor means? It suggests that honor was taken, if honor can be taken, who took it?

Seems to me, and I only watched a short time, this was another in a series of events where uber-patriotism and God are used to appeal to the emotions of the people. It reminded me of this well known remark, ' When fascism comes to America it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.

Of course I'm not suggesting Beck or those who organized today's event or past 'tea parties' are fascists, but they do put on events based solely on emotion which appeal to those who seem to want to hear simple solutions to complex and myraid problems.

Though the stage included a bit of diversity, when the camera pans the crowd there were only white people in view, and most appeared well fed and dressed in middle-class attire.
