Bookies today slashed the odds on Tony Blair to have left his job by the end of this month's Labour party conference from 16/1 to 7/1.
As speculation about Mr Blair's future increased following the resignation of seven members of the government, bookmakers faced a surge in bets on who would take over from him.

"The odds are rapidly being overtaken by events, and we are having to react accordingly," the Ladbrokes spokesman, Robin Hutchison, said.

"It's the only show in town as far as the punters are concerned. We went up with 16/1 and they bit our hands off, and we've been forced to go 7/1. How long that lasts is anyone's guess.
"We've not seen anything like it since David Cameron saw off David Davis."

Ladbrokes have cut the odds on John Prescott becoming the next prime minister from 100/1 to 25/1 following a rush of bets.

Mr Hutchison stressed that bets were for the next permanent Labour leader, and that Ladbrokes would not pay out on Mr Prescott if he was just "an interim seat warmer".

William Hill have cut the odds on the prime minister leaving this year from 5/1 to 9/4.

Despite today's press suggestions that Mr Blair will go in May, the odds on him leaving next year have lengthened during the day from 1/7 to 1/3 favourite.

William Hill are offering 16/1 that Mr Blair stands down in 2008, 40/1 in 2009 and 66/1 in 2010 or later. The prime minister is also 14/1 to stay on long enough to beat Margaret Thatcher's 11-year spell.

The chancellor, Gordon Brown is still the 1/5 favourite with William Hill to succeed Mr Blair as Labour leader.

Hill's are also offering 7/1 for the home secretary, John Reid, 8/1 for Alan Johnson, the education secretary and 10/1 for David Miliband, the environment secretary.

The international development secretary, Hilary Benn, the former health secretary Alan Milburn, and the leader of the Commons, Jack Straw, are all at 25/1.

The foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, is at 40/1, while the defence secretary, Des Browne, and the Welsh and Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Hain are 50/1. The former home secretary Charles Clarke is the outsider at 66/1.

Ladbrokes said the Conservatives have been cut from 4/6 to 4/7 to win the next general election, with Labour now 5/4 from 11/10 - the highest odds against a Labour win since 1995.
