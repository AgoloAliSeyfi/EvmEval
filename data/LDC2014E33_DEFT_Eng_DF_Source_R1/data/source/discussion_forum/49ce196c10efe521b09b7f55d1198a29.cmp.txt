There's no way she could have and still say that.

The only way to save face is to not read it but pretend she did.

Which makes her just an uninformed idiot, not really a full-boar liar.

I do recall she accepted a phone call from President Obama before she came forward with her statement regarding contraception. Whether he was providing her with "coaching" tips on how she is to present her statement regarding contraceptives, we will never know. Yet it's interesting how Obama chose to have a discussion with her BEFORE she came forward, instead of waiting for an opportunity to make himself available afterwards.

You recall wrong.

Obama called her out AFTER Rush called her a SLUT, after the media shitstorm - and to tell her her parents *should* be proud of her - not ashamed, as that dirtbag Limbaugh suggested.

obama is a hypocrite, he didn't call Laura Ingraham and give her a hug after Ed the Fat Schultz called her a slut. now did he?

I don't like this. I don't like what Rush did. I am not excusing him.

Frankly I'm pissed royally off. It was teen time. It was stupid.

I understand though at what he was getting at, but he should really truly not attacked the young woman in that way.

It was wrong.

So, the drug addled gasbag apologized for calling her a slut, but not for lying about her testimony in the first place. Not much of an apology.

Where does Rushbo's apology leave O'Reilly? O'Reilly defended the tub of goo and even went so far as to say Rush's 2nd favorite drug, Viagra, should be carried on insurance plans, but contraception should not.

Here's the text of the so-called "apology" issued Saturday by the Fat Man. If this was any weaker, it would look like swiss cheese with all the holes in it. Of course, it'll appease his dittoloonies.
"For over 20 years, I have illustrated the absurd with absurdity, three hours a day, five days a week. In this instance, I chose the wrong words in my analogy of the situation. I did not mean a personal attack on Ms. Fluke.

"I think it is absolutely absurd that during these very serious political times, we are discussing personal sexual recreational activities before members of Congress. I personally do not agree that American citizens should pay for these social activities. What happened to personal responsibility and accountability? Where do we draw the line? If this is accepted as the norm, what will follow? Will we be debating if taxpayers should pay for new sneakers for all students that are interested in running to keep fit? In my monologue, I posited that it is not our business whatsoever to know what is going on in anyone's bedroom nor do I think it is a topic that should reach a Presidential level.

"My choice of words was not the best, and in the attempt to be humorous, I created a national stir. I sincerely apologize to Ms. Fluke for the insulting word choices."

</quote>

LOL, it's all bullshit. I guess those sponsors of his put him in his place. That "absurdity with absurdity" shit is a smoke screen that he uses to try to snake his way out of the fucked up things that he says. FUCK LIMBAUGH and the rest of his crew.

</quote>

And all those who blindly defend this idiot.

</quote>

I don't see it so much of a defense of Rush but a comment on the absurdity of the Democrat's arguments.
