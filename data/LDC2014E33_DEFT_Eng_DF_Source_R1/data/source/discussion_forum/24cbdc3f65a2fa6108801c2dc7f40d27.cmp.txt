Yep, because us Ron Paul supporters are just going to write him in anyway and the GOP establishment would rather put another spend-whore liberal republican or warmonger against Obama. Grats Obama. That is all.

Ron Paul can always run third party if he wants to.

But Obama will probably win because you have to have a really compelling reason to vote out an incumbant, and the GOP hasn't given one yet.

The first 2 1/2 years he had a democrat congress and he could have done anything he wanted to and he did.

Problem with that argument is

1) The economy is finally starting to improve.

2) The GOP could be held to blame just as much as he can.
