sure, it's a study run by some religious wingnut zealot at some christian cow college, but it seems that abstinence only sex education is much more effective in preventing teen pregnancies and STDs than either traditional general health courses or courses that focus on safe sex.
it should also be noted that abstinence in this case does not refer to abstinence until marriage.

next thing you know, there'll be pictures of dinosaurs with jesus. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eek.gif"/>

A study of middle-school students that found for the first time that abstinence-only education helped to delay their sexual initiation is already beginning to shake up the longstanding debate over how best to prevent teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.

This is a rigorous study that means we can now say that its possible for an abstinence-only intervention to be effective, Dr. John B. Jemmott III, the University of Pennsylvania professor who led the study, said Tuesday, hours after results of the study were released. Thats important, because for some populations, abstinence is the only acceptable message.

In Dr. Jemmotts research, only about a third of the students who participated in a weekend abstinence-only class started having sex within the next 24 months, compared with about half who were randomly assigned instead to general health information classes, or classes teaching only safer sex. Among those assigned to comprehensive sex-education classes, covering both abstinence and safer sex, about 42 percent began having sex.

The problem with this news article is that it is claiming something that isn't true. The program wasn't an abstinence only program.

Other parts of the study's methodology is flawed. Easy enough to google to discover the flaws but here is one commentary on it.

<a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/robert-schlesinger/2010/02/02/study-shows-abstinence-sex-education-works-but-not-well-enough.html">Study Shows Abstinence Sex Education Works, But Not Well Enough - Robert Schlesinger (usnews.com)</a>

Sorry, Jesus will not be appearing on a dinosaur any time soon.

At least that's what studies show.

while i'm sure mr schlesinger enjoyed taking a swipe at the departed mr bush,
he adds nothing to the debate. no, it wasn't an abstinance only program in the benighted sense of the late bush administration, but it did advocate for waiting until *you* felt ready and strategies for dealing with peer pressure.
i can't access the study, but i would be very surprised and disappointed if the abstinence group did not receive information on forms of birth control as part of the STD curriculum.

as i mentioned in an earlier post, i teach a sexuality course for middle schoolers and we only hope to equip them to make safe, intelligent choices about when and how to become sexually active. it seems to me that dr. jemmott may have made a contribution to that.

That's nice, Del. No one has ever argued that telling kids to abstain is a wrong thing to do. It is a great thing to do. But you know kids, a huge majority of them just aren't going to do it.

So tell them to wait and tell them if they don't what the consequences could be. And tell them if they cannot wait how to protect themselves.

What study or research has there ever been into the validity of a teenager answering a question about sex?
None of these studies are valid. Teenagers lie.
