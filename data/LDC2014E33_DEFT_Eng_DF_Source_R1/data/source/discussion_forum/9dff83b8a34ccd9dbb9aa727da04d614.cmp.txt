True..FOX is state run media. But it's not part of anything Obama is doing. The Saudis run FOX.

So, owning a 7% share of a company means they 'run' Fox.... is that your assertion?

Seriously?

Shareholders

In August 2005 the Murdoch family owned only about 29% of the company. However, nearly all of these shares were voting shares, and Rupert Murdoch retained effective control of the company. Nonetheless, John Malone of Liberty Media had built up a large stake, with about half of the shares being voting shares. Therefore, in November 2006, News Corporation announced its intention to transfer its 38.5 per cent managing interest in DirecTV Group to John Malone's Liberty Media; in return it bought back Liberty's 16.3% shares in News Corp., giving Murdoch tighter control of the latter firm.[33] Murdoch sold 17.5 million class A shares in December 2007.[34]
Prince Alwaleed bin Talal al-Saud of Saudi Arabia, through his Kingdom Holding Company, owns 7% of News Corp.'s shares, making Kingdom Holdings the second largest shareholder.[35][36][37]
Years after when Elektra Records was absorbed in 2004, News Corporation owned half of the re-issues from the record label company.

For the record, it is a Saudi, not 'the Saudis'.

No, it was a pretty light turnout.

I wasn't talking about the story. I was simply responding to bullshit from idiots with a single fact. 'The Saudis' do not 'own' or 'run' Fox News. One Saudi owns 7% of shares in the company. I am bored with left wing hacks lying about this crap.

What's really sad is the left wing crazies around here, lead by Marcatl, who are using the tragic murder of that young kid in Florida to bash Fox News. And out and out lying about the coverage too, Sheppard Smith has been talking about it for the better part of 45 minutes, and they've covering it all day. You guys have absolutely no creditability at all.

It Marc was white and starting thread after thread defending Zimmerman, he'd be called a racist. And for good reason, in my opinion. Marc is a racist. Sad but true.
