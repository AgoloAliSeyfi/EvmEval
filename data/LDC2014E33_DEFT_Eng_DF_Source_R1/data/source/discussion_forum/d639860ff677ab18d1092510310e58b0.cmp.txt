History as taught and learned by the left wing propagandists will likely be kind to President Obama.

But if they were honest and objective, they wouldn't be.

This is part of why stooges like you cannot see even a glimmer of reality.

So you agree that if only 10% of what hacks like you say were true then our wonderful country would have folded in 1777? Or did I confuse you with someone with a different critical thinking skill set?

</quote>

No, moron. Unlike idiots like you, I don't subscribe to the positively retarded notion that those who disagree with chumps like you are "hacks." I read the drivel bullshit spew you posted. Ergo, it is clear that it is you who are the hack.

And no. The Country did well in terms of setting the foundation for what has lasted so far almost 240 years BECAUSE they subscribed to the things I believe and those whom morons like YOU consider "hacks" believe.

You wouldn't RECOGNIZE a critical thinking skill set, ya dickweed. You'd have to be able to think on your own. Clearly, you can't.

My, my. This is a positive thread about the Prez as some here said never happens and bam, the idiots show up and try and make it about themselves and how they view their perceived terribleness of 'Murica. For shame, for shame. Like I said earlier, if only 10% of the horseshit you rightwing bitches said were true then our wonderful country would have folded like a cheap suit in or about 1777.

I sometimes wonder if when Pelosi and Reid took over Congress and spent most of their time investigating and undermining Bush that they also purposefully took their eye's off the ball and the growing economic problems of the country.

How could they miss the inevitable housing bubble that most Americans suspected all along, given that they were directly responsible and had the inside scoop for instance? Bush warned them several times but they refused to act...mmm

If Reid and Pelosi had actually investigated gwb as you claim and I wished then he and many of his administration and other war criminals would now be in prison.

Another oddity with Pelosi &amp; Reid is the unemployment figures, after 1 year of Democrat control and the last of the Republican budgets past away, the unemployment figures started growing precipitously.

I suppose it's against the rules for Democrats to question these things...I understand just blaming Bush is the simplest of answers, no thought required...ergo the Obama/Democrat/ liberal press excuses... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_whistle.gif"/>

Had it been any one of those other palookas, say, Cain'n'Palin the country would have been in shambles.

Obama has pulled the country back from the brink of disaster that Bush'n'Cheney had left it in.

He's created ObamaCare, because, as we all know, Obama cares.

He's brought dignity back to the Office.

The economy has been steadily ticking up.

He saved GM...a WHOPPING success.

He got Bin Laden from a place that Bush didn't dare to go into. Khaddaffi's gone. Pirates of the seas know they can't 'EFF around with Americans or any of their properties.

He helped to liberate a country from a tyrant w/o spending too much time, money and with no casualties.

The rest of the world knows the same. Although he's not going around screaming about how big'n'tuff 'Murrka is.

He's pulling us out of war.

And, once again, the economy continues to tick up, despite his opponents in the GOP's efforts to undermine him at every. single. turn.

Yeah...I'd say Obama's a shoe-in for the next election.

Not to mention, History is going to be VERY kind to Obama...unlike the last guy.

So your standards are still pretty low?

Next chance you get, look in the mirror and repeat this 100 times... "I need to stop getting my info from Lawrence, Rachel, Ed &amp; Keith"...

They did a lot, too. Reid and Pelosi, but right now this thread is about the tremendous attributes of the current POTUS Barack Hussein Obama. Take your whine to another thread that might offer more cheese to your mousey mouth.

and oh by the way.. over Bush's 8 years of the Presidency he saved well over 200 million jobs.

I figure my guess is at least as reputable as the Obama's toadies.. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>
