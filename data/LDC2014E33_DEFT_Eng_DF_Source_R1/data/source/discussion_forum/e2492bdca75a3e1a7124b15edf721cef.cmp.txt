This is absolutely sickening. What in God's name is going on with the Federal Government? The Obama administration?

The world's largest oil skimmer has sat immobile for weeks on end as the BP Oil leak gushed. Obama golfed. Obama wined and dined. Obama fundraised. Obama wagged his finger at BP.

For the last 66 days the entire American skimming effort has resulted in 600,000 gallons of oil skimmed. The projected capabilities of the "A-Whale" skimmer is 500,000 gallons PER DAY.

Are Americans simply suffering from an incredibly inept and self-involved White House, or is it something even more dubious...?

The A-Whale bills itself as the largest open-water oil skimmer in the world, and it’s at least very impressive. Originally an oil and ore tanker, the ship’s owners recently refitted the ship to do exactly the kind of work that the US so desperately needs in the Gulf of Mexico, and to do it on a vastly larger scale than current operations can handle. According to the ship’s project manager, the entire American effort in 66 days has skimmed off 600,000 barrels of oil. The ship’s owners claim that A-Whale can skim 500,000 barrels a day

So where is the A-Whale now? In the Gulf? Not yet. It’s on its way there after being tied to a dock in Norfolk, Virginia, and won’t be allowed to join the cleanup effort until the Coast Guard and the EPA figure out whether it meets their standards

...Overton blasted BP and the federal government for a lack of effort and coordination in their dual oil-spill response and made a plea to the government to allow the A Whale to join the cleanup operation.

... This, by the way, is Day 68 of the Gulf crisis. The A-Whale didn’t get refitted on Day 66; this work had to have been done over months, if not years. Shouldn’t the government have known about the existence of this ship two months ago, and been working on certifying it immediately? The A-Whale shouldn’t have had to stop at Norfolk at all to get the nation’s attention, but should have been hired to steam directly to the Gulf and get to work immediately. It’s indicative of a crisis management team that is spending more time worrying about regulations and red tape than cleaning up the mess, just as we saw with Packgen’s boom.

your whine and outrage and melodrama and lies are a bit much sinatra....???

NORFOLK —
After making a brief stop in Norfolk for refueling, U.S. Coast Guard inspections and an all-out publicity blitz intended to drum up public support, a giant tanker billed as the world's largest oil skimming vessel set sail Friday for the Gulf of Mexico where it hopes to assist in the oil-cleanup effort.

The Taiwanese-owned, Liberian-flagged ship dubbed the "A Whale" stands 10 stories high, stretches 1,115 feet in length and has a nearly 200-foot beam. It displaces more water than an aircraft carrier.

Built in South Korea as a supertanker for transporting oil and iron ore, the six-month-old vessel was refitted in the wake of the BP oil spill with 12, 16-foot-long intake vents on the sides of its bow designed to skim oil off surface waters

what's the deal with you and making up your stories? the ship is 6 months old, it was hurriedly RETROFITTED AFTER the oil spill/gusher in the gulf happened, NOT months or years ago, and it stopped in norfolk for a 4 hour BRIEF coastguard review....NOT DAYS ON END, and immediately left for the gulf?

WHY all the lying about this on your part?

Don't call it lying, Care.

The Jones Act isn't an issue.

The EPA regulations do not apply in this situation. The oil is already in the Gulf, cleaning it out of the Gulf doesn't trigger the 99% rule. If it did, no skimmers or booms would be allowed because they are not 100% effective. Just because the rightwing echo machine makes a claim doesn't mean it is fact.

Jindal allowed barges to be sent out uninspected. If it were only a matter of lack of life jackets and fire extinguishers, there is no reason Jindal couldn't have supplied them himself since this was a State operation. Instead he chose to throw a fit and blame his fuck up on others.

I have very little doubt that the coordination of the many offers to help are bottlenecked by the very fact that SO MANY SUCH offers have been made.

This is, of course, unfortunate.

But coordinating these multiple offers -- such that it isn't a complete clusterfuck! -- doesn't exactly seem like a conspiracy to me, either.
