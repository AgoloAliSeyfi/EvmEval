It seems you didn't bother to read the statement by Bolton oralloy

<quote>
The United States goes to great lengths to ensure that small arms and light weapons transferred under our jurisdiction are done so with the utmost responsibility. The transfer of all military articles of U.S. origin are subject to extremely rigorous procedures under the U.S. Arms Export Control Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations. All U.S. exports of defense articles and services, including small arms and light weapons, must be approved by the Department of State. Assurances must be given by the importing country that arms will be used in a manner consistent with our criteria for arms exports: they must not contribute to regional instability, arms races, terrorism, proliferation, or violations of human rights. Arms of U.S. origin cannot be retransferred without approval by the United States. To ensure that arms are delivered to legitimate end-users, our government rigorously monitors arms transfers, investigating suspicious activity and acting quickly to curtail exports to those recipients who do not meet our strict criteria for responsible use. In the past five years, the United States has conducted thousands of end-use checks, interdicted thousands of illicit arms shipments at U.S. ports of exit, and cut-off exports entirely to five countries due to their failure to properly manage U.S. origin defense articles.

All commercial exporters of arms in the United States must be registered as brokers and submit each transaction for government licensing approval. Our brokering law is comprehensive, extending over citizens and foreign nationals in the United States, and also U.S. citizens operating abroad.

Believing that it is in our interest to stem the illicit trade in military arms, the United States has avidly promoted and supported such international activities as the Wassenaar Arrangement and the UN Register of Conventional Arms. Bilaterally, we offer our financial and technical assistance all over the world to mitigate the illicit trade in SA/LW. We have worked with countries to develop national legislation to regulate exports and imports of arms, and to better enforce their laws. We have provided training, technical assistance, and funds to improve border security and curb arms smuggling in many areas of the world where this problem is rampant. And in the past year, we have instituted a program to assist countries in conflict-prone regions to secure or destroy excess and illicit stocks of small arms and light weapons.

It seems Bolton (and the US) is against "illicit" trade just like the UN treaty is.

I'll say it once again: We need to have the military conduct airstrikes on these NGOs. They hate our freedom even more than Osama does.

A single napalm raid on IANSA headquarters could save us a lot of grief in the long run.

It has been pointed out that the proposed treaty deals only with the illegal manufacture and distribution of firearms--in which case, your objections don't seem to actually refer to the text of the proposed treaty.

As they build stronger and stronger measures to track down "illegal weapons" they'll move into making treaties that start declaring more weapons illegal.

<quote orig_author="Setanta">
It has also been pointed out (in particular, by me), that the consent of two thirds of the Senate would be required to secure ratification of such a treaty. Do you apprehend that this would occur?

The NRA does not have as strong a hold on the Senate as they do on the House. However, the requirement for 2/3rds of the votes is comforting. I'd guess that the NRA could block most of it. But my preference would be to not risk such a vote in the first place.

Also, the NRA has a poor track record in standing up for full-auto weapons, so their defense there might not be as solid as for other weapons.
