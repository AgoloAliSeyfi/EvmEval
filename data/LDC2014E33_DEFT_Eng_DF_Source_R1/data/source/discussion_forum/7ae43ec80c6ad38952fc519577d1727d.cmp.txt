1) Not in the Constitution. (It's the Declaration of Independence)

2) Has nothing to do with whether or not the states (the only entity that can regulate marriage) should be able to define who can and can't get married.

Which is why the marriage laws are different in all 50 states.

If you were to argue to me, that the laws should be changed because it's not unreasonable to let two consenting adults marry, even if they are of the same Gender, then, yes, that's not an imposition on anyone.

If you argue to me, marriage is whatever I want it to be because there's an imaginary "I want to" Clause in the 14th Amendment, I don't buy that shit at all.

the 14th Amendment has been in the constitution since 1870 or so. We are just noticing this now?

And unfortunately, unless the NJ Legistlature grows a pair of balls, that's probably what it's going to come down to. Or they can wait until he's tossed out on his can in 2013 and get a Governor who will sign the law.

They may decide who can and can not marry provided the criteria are applied consistently, excluding no particular class of persons, predicated on a compelling governmental reason.

The 14th Amendment requires that states and local jurisdictions allow all citizens equal access to the law. However a given state defines marriage for opposite sex couples, must be applied to same sex couples as well.

1868, actually; the Bill of Rights was first incorporated to the states via the 14th Amendment in 1897, concerning the 5th Amendment Taking Clause.

ItÂ’s not so much a matter of noticing it now as it is a conflict concerning its appropriate application.

Clay, nice stretching, but the logic of "I want to" in awarding marriage could strike down the incest and polygamy laws on the same basis.
