@izzythepush,

That is the most disgusting aspect of the "right to life" crowd. If they can shame a woman into not aborting, or otherwise interfere, when the child is born, they don't give a rat's ass what happens to them. There's a reason for the expression as cold as christian charity.

She's wrong, but why should anyone have a problem with her being able to express her opinions?

@mt774,

'You take love where you find it' my uncle told me that before he keeled over. And I believe it. I think to chastise someone for having a connection with someone whether the same sex or otherwise is the height of ignorance.
