According to them, the ONLY trustworthy news source is Fox news. I mean, any station that reports the news that doesn't slant their way is obviously liberal biased.

Couldn't the the right be saying the exact same thing about the liberal biased media? UCLA did a study a few years ago which proved liberal bias. CBS, NBC, ABC didn't do any story on the Black Panther fiasco, nor the follow up with the A.J. I guess it wasn't newsworthy enough for the liberal media.

So I'll ask this again. Which is more likely, be honest...

That ALL media, except for Fox news is biased. While Fox news is the only one reporting fair and even coverage of every story

OR

Or there are biased news on both sides, Fox on one side, MSNBC on the other and everything else just falls in between.

Step back and give me an honest answer. Which one seems more plausible?

It might be wise to just throw out the labels and ask why a story is or is not covered.

What seems plausible is that the gatekeeppers are still keeping the gates.

I think white conservatives are the last one I need explaining racism to me. When you focus nearly 95 percent on racism against whites you draw ridicule from educated people.

Ah another liberal being a racist. Implying he does not need to listen to conservatives why? Because we are all racist? You do realize thinking like that is just as bad as thinking an entire race is inferior right.

Fox is not news, it's republican propaganda. Msnbc is not quit as bad, but their sophomoric ways expose them. Fox at least pretends with the fair balanced line for the moron tea baggers.

</quote>

Fox is biased to the right, I will not deny it, but they are far more Fair and balanced than CNN or LOL MSNBC. If you actually watch Fox news, Not the commentators like hanity and what not. I mean the Hard News part. They are always very fair, and always have both sides of a story, and both sides represented by their guests.

Just got done watching a Segment on CNN about the NAACP vs Tea Party controversy.

As you all know the NAACP is alleging that Tea Party Rallies are "rampant with overt racial messages and signs"

So they had 2 African American men on. 1 from the Tea Party and one from the NAACP.

The segment lasted maybe 7 mins, and CNN allowed the guy from the NAACP to about 5 mins of that time. He Repeatedly claimed the Tea Party is rampant with Racism. During the entire 7 mins CNN was showing 3 different signs from a tea party rally. Over and Over. Just 3, which were mildly racial. The worst had a picture of what looks like an African Native doing a dance and said Obama Care with the C as a hammer and sickle. One said "Send oBUMa back to kenya", and the other one was not racial at all but made Obama look like a Nazi or Soviet style propaganda picture basically.

So after letting the Guy from the NAACP talk nearly the whole time. They finally let the Guy from the Tea Party talk. He of course said that CNN and the NAACP were purposely focusing on a handful of Signs and ingoring, and even deliberately not showing the Hundreds of other signs that were not even remotely Racist.

now as there is video on the internet of CNN doing just that before. I have no reason to assume anything other than they are doing just that right now.

Interestingly enough the NAACP is also claiming there were more than one sigh that read "Lynch Obama" and "Lynch Holder". One problem. NOBODY has been able to produce a single photo of these alleged signs. In Fact, I can not remember the guys name, but someone has offered 100,000 Dollars to anyone who can produce a picture of the alleged signs.

Please people in todays world of A camera in every phone. There is NO WAY in hell there were signs that Read "Lynch Obama" or "Lynch Holder" and nobody got a picture of them. Simply no way in hell. This is clearly a complete Fabrication, and it is also Clear CNN and the Rest of the Liberal Media are continuing to cherry pick signs from Tea Party rally's, and try to Paint the Tea Party as racist.

Very disturbing that such a large segment of our Media, is not only Biased, but actually working for the Democrats. Actively Slanting stories to try and Destroy the Tea Party.

They should all be Ashamed, and have no Right to call themselves objective.

Very pathetic.

Fox is widely ridiculed by educated people. It's entertainment for conservatives.
