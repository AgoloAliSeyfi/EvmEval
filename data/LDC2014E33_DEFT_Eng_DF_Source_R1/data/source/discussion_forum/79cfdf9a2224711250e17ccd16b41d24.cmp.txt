I was reading an article about how we need more black sold models for young black people to aspire to. Because apparently, all young blacks in Britain need an extra reminder not to commit crimes and be involved in gangs.

This highlights a severely racist phenomenon that is considered completely acceptable. That all these initiatives are exclusively targeting young black British people ( in attempt to curb the apparent swarms of exclusively black teenagers begging to be part of a gang) while completely ignoring any other skin colour.

Now obviously not every black male wants to go committing crimes all day, and the evidence suggests that blacks like committing crimes just as little as other skin colours do. So why the disproportionate representation in the media and in crime prevention strategies?

Why does nobody care about crime in the east European, the Asian or (god forbid) the white community?

Why is nobody saying how great a role model plan B is for all the young white kids growing up in council estates.

You can go anywhere in Britain and see that gang culture and criminals exist everywhere, in every ethnic group.

Logic would dictate that a white oriented initiative would make the most sense for demographic reasons. Or how about something which does not base its case on skin colour and ethnic origin?

Do people really think that a poor white teenager doesn't need support, encouragement or aspiration?

I completely agree with everything you've said. I also think it's this ridiculous idea that crime in certain ethnic groups needs to be dealt with more urgently that causes more problems.
If the ethnicity and colour of those committing crimes wasn't mentioned, it would be much less big a deal. Why this country feel the need to consistently talk about the colour of people is beyond me.

It's like when we beg for Asian/black police officers. If they don't want to do it, they won't. We should be judged on our merits, not our skin colour.
I believe it's things like this that make white people believe the country are going against them. If the government didn't deal with things only to do with race, then I, perhaps naively and idealistically, believe that it would become less of a big deal.

Because the government likes to create a sort of panic and it just so happens to be againsnt people of a different race talking from the point of view of a black teenager myself its hard to shake that stereotype <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/>

I agree.

I hate this attitude that Black kids need Black role models, Asian kids need Asian role models.

I've never heard a White kid say that they can't have Dizzee, Nelson Mandela or Ghandi as a role model because they aren't White. And yet the implication is that ethnic minorities cannot have a role model if they are White. Madness.

I'd like to point out I do really think that this is a PC agenda coming from namby pamby civil servants, apologists and do gooders, and it probably does not reflect the majority of the minority population's opinion <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

In London, blacks commit a disproportionate amount of crimes. Hence, why they're targeted. Most gangs in London are full of blacks. Black role models give black people hope. It's not about whether it should or why does it, it just does because black community are a semi-community. Blacks tend to group themselves with each other hence when someone black achieves something, it makes you thin you can achieve something. You can say we're all humans blah blah blah but we don't currently group ourselves as humans hence no one cares what a human achieves, it's only when it's relevant to your community you care.
