The fact that rival militia groups are battling one another was extremely predictable. This was a civil war between Libyans which the West should have not got involved in. It was enormously undemocratic for the West to favour one side of the civil war. Are those loyal to Ghaddafi not regarded to be part of the Libyan population? Both sides were fighting for different political idealogies and it was wrong to favour one side. Yes the military was part of Ghaddafi but the soldiers had the opportunity to switch to the rebels, which many did. But a large proportion remained loyal to Ghaddafi and decided to fight for what they thought was right.
Where were these so-called ''freedom fighters'' forty years ago when Ghaddafi came to power? The media portraits these rebels as civilians who simply picked up weapons. But how on earth do these supposed civilians become strategically and military advanced enough to take over whole towns? I'm not saying that Ghaddafi was the perfect leader, but in ten years time the Libyan people wish he was never overthrown.
The current situation reminds me of the time when the USA funded rebels in the 1980s to overthrow the communist Afghan government. Once they done this, the USA continued to fund individual warlords who battled it out over the control of the capital city, thereby killing 25000 innocent civilians.

The Arab league is not something that should be taken seriously.

I thought the Arab League and UN had just asked us to implement a NO FLY zone. We were supposed to stop Qaddafi them using his aircraft to drop bombs in cities occupied by the rebels. But we were smart enough to add another paragraph stating we were allowed to do anything to protect civilians. The Arab League did not understand that a no fly zone can have different meanings if worded appropriately.
