"To know a person's religion we need not listen to his profession of faith but must find his brand of intolerance." Eric Hoffer

The idiocy inherent in this OP is that somehow tolerance and respect for all religions is a bad thing. No one is bending anywhere, this is America, there is religious freedom, is that not clear by now. The fascist element on the right wants to limit freedom for all religions over 911, they obviously know none of our history of interfering in other nations. If you occupy or interfere in a nation's internal situation you open yourself up to retaliation. Have any of the idiots who hate Islam ever turned their hatred on doctor killers in this nation, on McVeigh a Catholic who killed many, or Eric Rudolph, another Catholic, who thankfully was less successful? The same narrow minded idiocy that fills the heads of these murderers fills the heads of those who cannot respect all people. Hatred and stupidity have no national or religious bounds. Humankind is still a primitive animal who can kill over ideas that exist only in the mind.

"We first kill people with our minds, before we kill them with weapons. Whatever the conflict, the enemy is always the destroyer. We're on God's side; they're barbaric. We're good, they're evil. War gives us a feeling of moral clarity that we lack at other times." Sam Keen <a href="http://fora.tv/2010/03/11/Sam_Keen_In_The_Absence_of_God">FORA.tv - Sam Keen: In The Absence of God</a>

Has anyone else ever noticed that whenever a group asks to be accepted and granted the same rights as everyone else, the reactionary right belly aches about "Bending over backwards" to accommodate citizens and their rights? Take a look at any of the anti-Gay marriage threads. Same meme. Women's rights? Civil rights? Why the reactionaries all gripe about "bending over backwards".

I guess the rights enjoyed by the reactionaries are somehow exclusive to that group and anyone else wanting equal treatment is just an annoyance.

I love the way the left belly aches and whines for equality but when they are in control theirs no such thing. It's their way or else.

Just how is there no such thing as equality? Are you being denied equal rights? Can you please cite specifically where I'm wrong and you are right on this issue? Or are you just venting and whining because that's just what you do?

It's their way or else? What do you mean by that? And you're not being treated unfairly, unless you are gay, a woman, an immigrant, or a minority and are forced to interact with a right wing extremist like you.
