It is the beginning of 2011. The Presidential election is 22 months away. Election day is November 6th, 2012. That seems like forever, but in the world of politics, it is not. Depending on who you listen to, there are 12 or 18 or even 24 Republicans thinking about running.
Some of them may declare as early as March of 2011 in order to get some media attention and to attract the best staff people. Others may decide to keep their powder dry.
This thread is aimed at political junkies as well as casual observers of the American political process.

I have a few posts setting up the logistics of the Republican process. It shouldn't take me long. Feel free to jump in or wait an hour or so.

I am a political junkie and I am a liberal Dem. I hope that I built up some respect in the year-long thread about the recent mid-term election, which focused on polling. I tried hard to be non-partisan.
This thread has been in the planning stage for a month or more via emails. I have lined up a co-host, self-described as a conservative although not necessarily a Repub. Another person has offered, I think, to be a regular contributor, concentrating perhaps on polls.
The mid-term elections' thread begged people to stay on topic, and it largely worked. I have no such illusions about this one being the same.
Will there be a challenge to Obama or a run by an independent?

The Republican convention to nominate a Presidential candidate is scheduled to be in Tampa, FL, Aug 27-30, 2012. The Dems will hold their convention Sep 3-6 in Charlotte, NC, Cleveland, OH, Minneapolis, MN or St Louis, MO.
The Libertarians will be in Las Vegas May 4-6, while the Constitution party will get together in Nashville sometime in April or May.
One more post and I will be done. Promise.

The Republicans' rules this time around are still in flux. As I understand it, there will be primaries/caucuses in the traditionally early states of Iowa, South Carolina, New Hampshire and Nevada in February of 2012 (not in January).
That could force California, Florida, New York, Maryland and Georgia to move to March or April.
The interesting twist is that any state doing anything in March must have proportional apportionment vs a winner take all system.
I repeat that the Repubs' rules still seem to be evolving.
I am done with the set up.

@realjohnboy,

Very ambitious. Look forward to seeing how this develops.

@Finn dAbuzz,

Thanks. I hope you will participate. I have started numerous threads on A2K over the last 8 or so years, some of which flourished while others withered or were dead on arrival. So it goes.
The mid-term election one worked because it was seen by many as being balanced. I got emails from A2Ker's in a half dozen different countries, for example, commenting about it being a concise commentary by the people reporting.
I doubt this thread will be able to maintain that standard, but it should be a romp, nonetheless.

Ok, I'm calling it for Rick Perry, current governor of Texas. He refused to rule out a run when he was recently reelected. Because Texas pulls in very high oil revenues, Perry can claim that he cut taxes and balanced the budget at the same time compared to other governors that try that and have it blow up into monster deficits. Texas also came through the recession really well, again thanks in part to the oil industry. He can play the immigration card saying as a border governor he understands the challenges posed by illegal immigration, etc. Not sure on the religion card, but if he got elected in Texas, he's probably got a check there as well. Plus, no baggage from previous national runs (see Palin, Gingrich, et al). Perry is where my two cents land.

I am the cohost that RJB mentioned.
Now that that's out of the way, here are a few repubs that I think will run. I am posting by memory because I am still at work.

Sarah Palin...self proclaimed conservative
Mike Huckabee..conservative
Newt Gingrich...conservative, former Speaker of the House
Mitt Romney..hard to get a read on his politics

There are others, and I will post more when I get home.
Feel free to jump in with opinions and comments, but lets try to be civil.

@engineer,

Perry is an option, but I think being from Texas might hurt him. People will point out that Bush was from Texas, so Perry will have that baggage, even if it isn't right.
He will be connected to Bush somehow.

In the interest of full disclosure, I must admit that I was a Sarah Palin supporter when she first came onto the national scene.
After listening to her, I freely admit that I was disillusioned by her lack of depth.r
Before I declare again, I will have to do some serious research and soul searching.

Rjb, I don't know what's going on, but your post responding to Engineer
has vanished. Did you delete it?

@mysteryman,

I don't think I did, at least not deliberately. I wonder what I said? I doubt it was anything important.
