hmm, I'm not sure how. Spending only increased pretty much bang on when the ressession started.

tbh, I'm not sure why the spending increased so dramatically in 2008. It was all going fine until then.

I guess it was the prices of stuff increasing/spending to try to prevent the ressession causing too much damage. I see little change in policy over those few years to warrant such an increase. Maybe someone who knows a little about economics can tell me why <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/dontknow.gif" alt=":dontknow:"/>.

+ as far as I can tell spending hasn't actually decreased a whole lot under the conservatives...

I'm getting very annoyed with some of the strike stuff going on. Something about pilots striking because they only got a pay rise of 4%, wtf? Train drivers get paid a lot of money, yet strike seemingly every other day. Everyone is going to take a hit in a goddamn ressession, make do with your quite good outcomes and stop faffing around with stupid strikes. Strike when you damn well need to, at some point someone is going to strike for a damn good reason and it'll just &amp;quot;be another strike&amp;quot; and get ignored.

Spending was all ready too high by then, during the height of boom times the Labour government was still running at a massive deficit which is frnakly, idiotic. That was the problem, spending is gradually being cut, but you can see the resistance being felt <img src="images/smilies/tongue.png"/>

I've always thought this generally about people who oppose the cuts. What do you suggest we do instead? The fact is we've borrowed and spent too much money. Either we have to make cuts or raise taxes, or probably both.

Given that they're socialists they'll probably say to tax the rich even more. They're like a never ending pot of free money in the eyes of socialists.

In the height of boom, 2007-2008 this graph shows the spending and revenue close. Notice the conservatives haven't decreased spending (but it is forecast to decrease)

<img src="http://www.debtbombshell.com/images/uk-budget-deficit.png"/>

Its hard finding decent graphs of the deficit... This one shows that the deficit has been pretty average till 2008. There was a deficit, but it was average and pretty normal.

Cuts are necessary, it's just a shame it has to hit the poorest people most. The pain could be equally shared by putting up taxes for high earners. looking at the way the cuts are being managed at the moment, WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT ALL IN THIS TOGETHER!

Higher earners are now paying an extortionate 50% tax rate.

The cuts are not being thought through. Let's look at what's happening to teachers - being made to work longer and pay more for a lower pension. Look closer and realise that forcing teachers to work longer will raise the average age of the teaching community and will therefore mean the government is paying more in teacher salary than before. It also means that for every teacher who will now stay on when they wouldn't have before, there will be a teacher that has been trained with government money who will not get a job. This person will either claim welfare or will claim a job that previously someone else would have had - the latter person will therefore now claim welfare. Overall, this huge hammer to teachers will probably not save much money at all. It is done purely for political reasons - the world needs to see austerity so that they can have confidence in investing in UK.

Secondly, sorry to be cliched, but the people who caused this situation should pay for it. If necessary, strip the nationalised banks and sell their assets. It is completely immoral that banks and building societies that played safe for low reward have to watch the banks that played dangerous for high reward being saved with a bail out.

Finally, GTFO Libya and Afghanistan. Sorry to be heartless but a Government's first duty is to its own people.

Wondered how long it would be before a socialist brought up the teachers/nurses/doctors 'arguement'.

It's not that I completely hate the cuts, I realise they're necessary... I just get ****ed off when George Osborne writes off a billion dollars of tax that vodafone didn't pay and then has to get that money back by cutting from the poorest. It's the bankers and buisnesses fault really.

Osborne has not written off a billion dollar tax bill. Stop listening to the muppets from UK uncut.

Oh, I wasn't denying the increase, but the fact that Labour was increasing spending that was already in a deficiet, at the height of what really was the biggest boom of the modern era, well it shows rather a lack of forward thinking. Especially considering the boom-bust nature of the typical cycle <img src="images/smilies/tongue.png"/>
