It's like you get paid a LOT of money to embarrass yourself. You claim to know better than them, don't even attempt to explain why, then ignore their views because they didn't fight the Japanese? Holy fuck you are stoopid.

No the STUPID one is you. NONE of the Generals or Admirals that FOUGHT the Japanese are on your list, now are they? The Pacific war against the Japanese was so different from the European war as to make the experiences learned from one pointless in the other.

The reality is a simple one. The US intended to force an Unconditional Surrender. The Japanese on paper were beaten but refused to give up and had millions of troops under arms with millions more civilians able to be called on.

The Japanese Government was Fanatical. Run by the Army they had no intention of surrendering. We were looking at a main Island landing the first part of 1946. This would have cost MILLIONS of lives mostly Japanese.

None of the European Officers had a clue what the Japanese were like.

Holy fuck you keep increasing your stoopidity factor. Macarthur was the Supreme Commander in the Pacific from 1942-1945 you dumb bitch. Why don't you tell us all how the Supreme Commander of the Pacific didn't "have a clue" about the Japanese.

Not to mention...if not fighting the Japs eliminates the possibility of an opinion....then why do you claim to have one you fuxxing cunt?

CurveLight, you are clearly emotionally disturbed and cognitively impaired. The rest of the world is overwhelming in step, and you are out of step. You are wrong, period.

Good job on sticking to ad homs when you can't support your claims. You never showed why all the commanders were wrong and your Iraq Melthod is fuxxing stale.

The Iraq Method is your idiocy, and the event proved the few commanders who opposed it to be wrong. This discussion proves that your cognition is definitely impaired. So move along, your case is summarily dismissed.
