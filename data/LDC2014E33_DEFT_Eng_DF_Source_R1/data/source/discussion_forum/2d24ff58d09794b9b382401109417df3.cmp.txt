and where was your moral high ground when you defended Obama's sitting under that lunatic pastor who said we deserved the 9/11 attacks? (among other things) pot meet the fucking kettle.

</quote>

Obama distanced himself from Rev Wright's rhetoric. And did he really say 'deserve' or is that a construct of your empty headed biased ignorance? But the point is, you hypocrites don't distance yourselves from the likes of Rush boy because that all is all you have: stone throwers. Do you defend Bush while you criticize Obama? Hypocrite, add elvis to your list.

Why should we distance ourselves from Rush. Rush is usually right. He may be bombastic. He make go well over the top to make specific points (like when he announce he was supporting Ross Perot during the 1992 election and spent the whole first hour in that character just to prove a point.

The fact is that Rush is just a radio talk show host. Sure, he's iconic and successful and a fixture on talk radio since 1988 when he and Roger Ales got together. But, he's no more important than Jon Liebawitz (Stewart) or Cobert or Maher or the rest of the cast of characters on the left. You need to laugh to be entertained. The right can listen to Limbaugh and be entertained. Rush has no more or less of a political message as they do and deserves to be held to the same standards of accountability (or lack their of) as they do.

There is the contradiction, by being bombastic you are in effect doing it for shock value, and facts just are not really shocking so to get the shock you have to exaggerate and take a lot of artistic licensing to make it so.

Are you advocating that she is censored? Would you like to tweak the First Amendment a little to prevent people from saying those things?

Or are you just advocating that the President stand up and condemn a mean-spirited comment that was said about a conservative commentator? A comment that was spoken by an individual that was not a representative of his administration.

Because, if Obama is required to condemn mean-spirited comments that are made by citizens that are not part of his administration, then he's got a lot of apologizing to do.

He can start here:

I HOPE RUSH LIMBAUGH IS RUN OVER BY A STEAMROLLER AND THEN HIS FLATTENED CARCASS DEVOURED BY HUNGRY WOLVES.

Because that is a pretty mean-spirited comment, if I might say so myself.

One might say that apologizing is pretty much his stock and trade. Or maybe he can only do that when he leaves the country, not within it.

Can't argue with that, but isn't it a bit hypocritical to complain about it while at the same time demanding it?

It doesn't matter how many times you show the brainwashed Ditto-Dopers actual quotes of LimpBoy saying he hopes Americans are in PAIN from the loss of their jobs and the PROLONGING of the Bush Depression so he can in "EUPHORIA" watch the suffering of the American people, they still parrot their programming that LimpBoy was talking about "policy" rather than SPITE.

Another typical liberal response. "I'm too bitter to get a joke (when it comes from the right)" <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_whistle.gif"/>

Really? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_eh.gif"/> So... since I'm a "liberal" (according to many on here) I was somehow breaking an unwritten rule by laughing at the stupid nonsense jokes instead of whining about who said what and who laughed at it?

</quote>

I've seen what you've written Kitten, I don't think you are a lib. You seem to hold just as many cons. positions as liberal positions. I would say if you cared to bone up on political ideology per se, as opposed to just issue by issue positions, you would probably end up being more conservative than not.

On this issue, I'm in your original camp, I didn't really care. I'm just in here sharp-shooting cuz I'm bored. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_shhh.gif"/>
