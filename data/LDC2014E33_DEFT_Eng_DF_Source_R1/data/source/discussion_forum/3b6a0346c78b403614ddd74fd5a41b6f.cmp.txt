Not looking for support. Just stating my mind. All those things you mention are the twisted twine ball of the government. Of course my family is entitled to all I have earned when I am gone. It should be a matter of fact not a goverment regulation. Nor should my family have to deal with the government in any way other than maybe to prove they exist if the government owes me.

Just government "twisted twine" ball?

Lets say that you are a small business owner. The business is in your name. One day coming home from work there is a car accident and you are killed and being fairly young and possessing in a sense of invulnerability you have not created a Will.

One of the "twisted twines" of government recognition of Civil Marriage is that if someone passes without a will, their spouse is the inheritor of the estate and it is transferred to the surviving spouse with very little tax liability. With Civil Marriage your wife is the recognized heir of your estate and the business passes to her. Without Civil Marriage the passing of your business (or portion thereof in the case of join ownership) would not be viewed as the inheritance of a spouse, it would be viewed as income and therefore liable for taxes. You owned the business (or your share) and (s)he owned nothing or his/her share - when your spouse acquired your portion - that is income on their part.

Without Civil Marriage your wife - in the eyes of the law - is not family and is as a stranger to you. Without a will, under the inheritance laws of most states - strangers have no claim on an individuals estate and the property transfers to the next closest blood relative. (Remember a spouse is not a "blood relative", they are a family member established because of recognition of Civil Marriage under the law.) If you have no blood relatives (or none come forward) it's even possible that the estate could pass to the government to dispose of.

You say "Nor should my family have to deal with the government in any way other than maybe to prove they exist if the government owes me" yet there is no recognition of Civil Marriage establishing that bond between you and your spouse, then your spouse is not part of your family. Then you say that your spouse may have to prove that she is your spouse - but that is the government recognizing her as family - something that if the government doesn't recognize marriage they would not be able to do.

Logically speaking the government cannot "not recognize marriage" then turn around and "recognize marriage" because when they recognize it, then logically they are no longer "not recognizing" it.

What you describe is all more government en"twinings". What i am saying is all of that is none of governments business other than to enforce that my family owns my shit. Period end of story end of involvement. My family is whoever I said it was.

For the government to recognize that your family owns your stuff, you by default need government recognition that you have established a "family" with another person who, prior to some point in time, was not a member of your family. That's what Civil Marriage is, it is the recognition of a family status between two people who are not blood relatives.

Without that recognition, under the eyes of the law - a spouse is just a live-in boyfriend or girlfriend, they are not family.

Well I'm off to bed.

FF, thanks for the discussion, I'll leave the last post of the evening to you. Thanks for the honest discussion and (something rare around here sometimes) an honorable exchange of ideas without it devolving into name calling and personal insults.

I enjoyed it immensely.

Well, I don't agree that there is a constitutional "right" to gay marriage.

But I think that the crafting of laws should be left to the legistlature. That's their function. And unlike a referendum, they have the time and ability to craft laws.

The veto power of a governor or president should be reserved for instances when a legislature acts irresponsibly. Here, it hasn't.

Christy is just sucking up to a larger national stage. Because he knows his fat ass is probalby done in the Gubenertorial election of 2013.

Wow, so like do the voices in you head give you translations to perfectly valid arguments when you can't refute them.

Jabba is sucking up to the national stage, because he knows his shelf life is short. He's gone in 2013 and he knows it.
