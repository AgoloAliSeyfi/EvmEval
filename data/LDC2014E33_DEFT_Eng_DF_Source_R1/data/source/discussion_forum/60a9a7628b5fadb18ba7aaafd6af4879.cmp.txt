I see what you are saying. Some of the responses to my post have left me bewildered. Someone posted "there is no evidence that an ice age is coming again". Several Ice Ages occurred over Earth's existence. The idea that magically it is something not to worry about strikes me as very strange.

Glaciation thousands of years in the future is not something to worry about. Nor is it something for your children or grandchildren to worry about. Heck, the Sun will become a Red Giant someday and that's not something to worry about. There are much more pressing issues.

That is, until I read your opinion and analysis.

Yours haven't surprised me in the slightest.

Correct, they say "probably."

Or "to the best of our current knowledge..."

Which has done well for us as an inquiring species in the last few centuries.

Say Goodbye to Sunspots? ( And Global Warming?)

14 September 2010

Scientists studying sunspots for the past 2 decades have concluded that the magnetic field that triggers their formation has been steadily declining. If the current trend continues, by 2016 the sun's face may become spotless and remain that way for decadesa phenomenon that in the 17th century coincided with a prolonged period of cooling on Earth.

 snip 

The last solar minimum should have ended last year, but something peculiar has been happening. Although solar minimums normally last about 16 months, the current one has stretched over 26 monthsthe longest in a century. One reason, according to a paper submitted to the International Astronomical Union Symposium No. 273, an online colloquium, is that the magnetic field strength of sunspots appears to be waning.

 snip 

The phenomenon has happened before. Sunspots disappeared almost entirely between 1645 and 1715 during a period called the Maunder Minimum, which coincided with decades of lower-than-normal temperatures in Europe nicknamed the Little Ice Age. But Livingston cautions that the zero-sunspot prediction could be premature. "It may not happen," he says. "Only the passage of time will tell whether the solar cycle will pick up." Still, he adds, there's no doubt that sunspots "are not very healthy right now." Instead of the robust spots surrounded by halolike zones called penumbrae, as seen during the last solar maximum (photo), most of the current crop looks "rather peaked," with few or no penumbrae.

Au revoir, possibly.

Sadly not.

Solar minimum won't slow warming: study

A dimming of the Sun to match conditions in the 'Little Ice Age' of the 17th century would only slightly slow global warming, according to new research.

The study, which appears in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, reveals a weakening of solar activity in recent years, linked to fewer sunspots, would cut at most 0.3°C from a projected rise in temperatures by 2100 if it becomes a long-lasting 'Grand Minimum' of brightness.

"The notion that we are heading for a new Little Ice Age if the Sun actually entered a Grand Minimum is wrong," says study lead author Dr Georg Feulner of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.

World temperatures are likely to rise by between 3.7°C and 4.5°C by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions keep building up - far more than the impact of known shifts in solar output, the study shows.

The Sun has gone through four Grand Minima since the 13th century, including the Maunder Minimum from 1645-1715 that overlapped with the Little Ice Age.

seeing the hottest global temps since record keeping began occurred this year....

sunspots may contribute to climate shifts but notice the term "coincide" in the article

In the current case the hottest global temps are "coinciding" with the longest solar minimum.

y <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/About/Contact-Us-Feedback">Nancy Atkinson</a>, UniverseToday / July 19, 2010 Was last month warm where you live? If so, you weren't alone. According measurements taken by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) June 2010 was the hottest June on record worldwide. But this is not a new trend, at least for this year. March, April, and May 2010 were also the warmest on record. This was also the 304th consecutive month with a global temperature above the 20th century average. The last month with below-average temperature was February 1985.

and the first 6 months of 2010 the hottest yet recorded.

The impact of a weakening sun spot structure might ameliorate our folly to some small degree...... in no way shape or form will we say goodbye global warming.

AGW is here to stay.....carbon is forever ( in human scale )
