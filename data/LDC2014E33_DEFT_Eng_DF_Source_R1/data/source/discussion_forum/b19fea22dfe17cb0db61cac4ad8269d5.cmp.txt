My partner recently passed away and I have now been informed there is to be an inquest.

I was telephoned by a police officer who performed the indentification part of the process for the Coroner then explained he would come round and take my statement. He was very polite and very kind. He told me he would wait a couple of weeks to let me get the funeral out of the way and to try and remember as much as I could and also any questions I would like answers to. I told him to bring lots of pens and paper because I had lots I wanted to say and lots of questions.

I am not being legally represented (no legal aid available for coroners inquest).

Instead of trying to remember everything (it stretches back nearly two years) when the officer arrives to take my statement, I thought I would start work on it over the Bank Holiday. It now stretches to 20 pages.

I am not sure if what I have written is what the Coroner actually wants or what he can use. I understand his scope is very limited.

I can find lots of information online about how to set down my statement if I was a medical professional but I cant find any examples of what a family member witness statement should look like or what I can include.

Obviously, most of my information is verbal communication, my own thoughts, my partners hearsay evidence (when we talked about who said what to her at appointments) my concerns I raised at the time, telephone calls I made at the time and what those people said to me etc etc etc..

I have tried to give a full picture of what happened during this time including conversations I had and telephone conversations.

This was a long and ongoing struggle that lasted almost 2 years. I tried on several occasions to get written replies but they were never forthcoming. Health professionals would normally ring me even after I asked them to use a medium where we would have copies of discussions.

Reading back through my statement so far, I'm thinking 99% of it would be classed as hearsay and my own thoughts and interpretations of events.

My statement makes perfect sense and follows a time-line up to her death. I have been very careful not to accuse or apportion blame or to speculate on the treatment in hindisght. However, I have included my objections and concerns I raised at the time and why I objected.

1. Im not sure if I can include conversations (as I recall them) or whether they will be classed as hearsay and removed.

2. Im not sure if I can include my own thoughts surrounding decisions.

3. Im not sure if I can include objections and conerns I raised at the time about decisions.

My partner suffered from a mental illness (anorexia) so as you can imagine, things are not clear cut and simple. Its not as if she went into hospital, was given the wrong drug, then died.

There was almost two years of me raising my concerns and talking to consultants, medical doctors, psychiatrists, psycologists, social workers, dieticians and GP. The vast amount was done in person or over the phone although I did put my concerns on paper a few times. They were never addressed with a letter. I would get a phone call.

If I remove my hearsay evidence (no corroborationg paperwork) then my statement will read something like this - she suffered from anorexia. She died.

Obviously I feel there is more to it than that.

I really need to know what the Coroner wants in that witness statement and how as a family member I am allowed to present it.

Firstly I am sorry for your loss.

Secondly, if you have written it all down, I would not worry too much about the rules of evidence at this stage and just let the cororner's officer go through it. He/she will know what is admissible and what is not, and it may be that some of the things you have written about, whilst not admissible in themselves, will inform the coroner sufficiently as to what went on, to mean that he/she should call some of these health professionals to give their own evidence about how they treat this particular illness.

Firstly, I'm very sorry to hear of your loss. I hope that you are receiving support - whether this be from friends and family or something a bit more structured.

I really don't know what the coroner will need or be able to use but can I suggest that you put down everything that you remember or want to put down. That way the people in the know will be able to pick and choose what is needed from what you have provided.

I'd say it's better to provide too much than not enough.

I agree with the others, it is better to say everything, and let them edit it themselves, they will pick the relevant information out, that is their job. At least you will be secure in the knowledge that you told them everything you could remember. I would also imagine that writing that all down, no matter how painful, must also have been cathartic for you. I hope you got the other issues over her funeral resolved too. Best wishes.
