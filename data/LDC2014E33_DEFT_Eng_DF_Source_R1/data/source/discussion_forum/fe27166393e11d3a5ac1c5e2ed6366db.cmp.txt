Sounds about right except that as the area destablizes every potential exists for Russia to jump into the mix. We know for a fact that at some point the scenario you have outlined will occur.

One thing I find amazing is that Israel is about the size of Rhode Island. Its hard to conceive that one small nation can be the focus of so much hatred.

In comparison the Arabs hold massive land areas with incredible resources. I would not say they have taken successful advantage of them. In the long history of Islam it has warred with every ideological system it contacts and when it is not, they war with each other. In looking at democides lately, I'm beginning to conclude that that they have killed as many as if not more of themselves than others.

Regardless of world opinion and revisionist history, when God says something it is true and will hold.

For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods. 5 For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens. Ps. 96

I would say that is pretty viable. Let me add that oil prices would be so high that it would send the world economy into a tail spin.

It is disappointing to me that nobody here has been able to come up with any better suggestions about how to deal with the present reality of Iraq. There seem to be a lot of critics, but no better alternative plans.
