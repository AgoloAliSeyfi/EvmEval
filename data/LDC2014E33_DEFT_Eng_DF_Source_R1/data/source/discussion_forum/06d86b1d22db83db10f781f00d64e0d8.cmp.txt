The vote for gay marriage is about to happen in Maine. Heteros are frightened that they might have to share marriage with gays and lesbians.

I have something to say to these heteros. How about some of your own medicine. Your exclusionary club of bigotry is about to be infiltrated.

I had my ears boxed, ran from my school so many times crying, I had snowballs, apples and even rocks thrown at me by the kids. Bullies "attempted" to beat me up while the other kids looked on and helped the bullies. Even girls tried to beat me up. Much like I have been treated here too. I have tough skin and a suspicious heart. No friends who would admit to caring about me let alone loving me. Teachers and principles would not shield me from other kids and my family doesn't even know I exist. My mom was the only one who stood by me.

WHY ARE PEOPLE SO CRUEL? Because they are part of the same christian right that now is attempting to block gay marriage.

The yes on 1 folks say that children will be taught about homosexuality in schools... Well they already are taught about homosexuality in schools.

Unlike my school where they were taught that homosexuals were sick devil spirit ridden souls that were gonna burn in hell.

Take this scenario.

A man leaves his girlfriend and the mother of his kids... He marries another woman. His children are given to him because of abuse by the girlfriend/mother. (Yes heteros sometimes abuse their children) After a while he finds out that his new wife is a lesbian and does not love him. Then he realizes he is bisexual. He finds a man who adores him and loves his children as his own flesh and blood. But the schools only recognize the marriage he has with "a woman" (who is not even the mother) who does not really love him nor does she care for his children from the other woman. They don't even kiss and deep inside he is hurting for someone to complete his life. Yet the narrow Maine marriage law based on bigotry is standing in the way. So the law says he is better off with a lesbian wife who doesn't love him or his kids (cuz marriage is only between a man and a woman) than to be with a man who loves him and would share fully in his parental duties. So if he were to leave his lesbian wife for a man he might lose his children. Does this sound fair?Would the kids be happier with two fathers who love them than a man and woman where only one parent REALLY loves them?

Marriage equality under the law, END THE DISCRIMINATION...

@Diest TKO,

Nothing is for sure I have learned to live with many failures. I hope to see marriage equality in my state in my lifetime before I am too old to enjoy the benefits of a same sex marriage. If we lose I will go home and cry my heart out... If we win I will invite you all to the wedding. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"/>
