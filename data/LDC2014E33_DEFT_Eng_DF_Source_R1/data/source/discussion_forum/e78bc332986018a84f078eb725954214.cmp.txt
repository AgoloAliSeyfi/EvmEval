As said by many, if you can't afford a dollar for a condom, you have two choices. 1) keep it in your pants or 2) keep your legs closed... Depending on you sex.

To force a church to go against its beliefs just so some poor fool can have sex without danger of getting a girl pregnant makes so little sense I can't believe people here are even defending it. The redirect to world poverty... Water shortages... The church.... Not a single word said about the idiocy of someone that poor thinking about mating.

If you want to take away religious freedoms, you better come up with a better plan then 'but I can't afford a $1 condom'

maybe churchs shouldnt operate hospitals then. if they have a problem with performing or providing certain services that are part of that business model, then maybe they shouldnt be in that business to begin with.

why would an intelligent person get involved in a business in which parts of it could violate their beliefs? that would be like a devout muslim opening a liquor store but refusing to sell booze.

So, you support taking away religious liberty. Nice. Idiot.

This is some really weird retroactive time warp shit.

You seem pretty clueless to the fact that Catholic hospitals have been around a long time and have not been violating their beliefs. Their "business model" has been thriving.

If you want to go the whole muslim route, then to make your completely false analogy a true one, what Obama has done is force a Muslim-operated convenience store which has been around for more than a century to start selling booze.

And then here comes you, saying "Gee, why would a Muslim have a business model that violates his beliefs? I don't get it!" <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_doh.gif"/>

if you rule that religious hospitals apply for exemptions to laws based on religious beliefs, you up a whole different set of issues than just the contraception issue.

i could make the argument (in court) that my religion prohibits me from providing cancer drugs, aids drugs, heart drugs, or cholesterol drugs, or any other drug on the market. would that be an acceptable consequence in your mind?

</quote>

Has anyone ever done that?

No?

Okay. Just keep making shit up.

</quote>

In fact withholding lifesaving drugs by a parent because of their religion has been litigated, and the parents lost.

Not the same thing as a hospital withholding care, now is it.

But keep trying. I'm sure there's a slippery slope around here somewhere that isn't fallacious.

the child did not have t6he choice to be brought upo by parents that woulde allow meidcal care...it had to be decided as it was.

One can get a job at a different hospital if they do not like the health insurance offered.

I'm sorry, but how does providing abortions equate with healing the sick in a Catholic hospital? I know of grocery stores who won't sell tobacco. It's their choice as to what services they will provide and what they won't. At least it is in a free society.

i dont see where providing free abortions is part of this discussion
