Well after mulling it over for a few days, I've decided what I'm going to do. Although I appreciate everyone's replies, I don't feel comfortable with the suggestions that I allow my daughter to have/use 'whatever' only in the house. To my mind, she is either allowed something or she's not, you can't be allowed something 'a wee bit' iyswim. I think as soon as you do the 'wee bit' of something, you've already stepped on that path and if you've allowed it at all, you've given the message that it's ok.

Again, using FCUK as an example......if you don't agree with the branding on principle (examples below taken from Wiki).....

French Connection exploited the controversy of the name, producing an extremely popular range of t-shirts with messages such as "fcuk fashion", "fcuk this", "hot as fcuk", "mile high fcuk", "too busy to fcuk", "lucky fcuk", "Fun Comes Usually Kneeling", "fcuk on the beach", Cool as fcuk, etc. There were also a number of regionally specific messages, such as "fondle constantly until knackered" (in the UK), "fcuk in hull","no fcukin worries" (in Australia) and "fcuk off". "Chugging the fcuk" and "Munching on fcuk" were popular shirt titles.

............. then would you still think ok it to to put in the dressing up box? Or only wear in the house? I wouldn't. This is a good example of a clear cut, 'either allowed it or not' item in my mind. Anything which I feel is extremely 'tarty' or 'sexual' doesn't have a place in my daughter's life at age 10 so I can't allow it 'sometimes' otherwise I would feel I was compromising my principles and taking the easy route for a quiet life rather than the tougher route of making the sometimes unpopular type of decision I associate with being a good parent.

I think kids need clear dividing lines so they always know what you will allow and what you wont, doing something 'a little' bit' or 'only at certain times' leaves room for interpretation imo and pretty soon you'll fall foul of the 'well I've already done it/used it/ worn it then so why can't I do it now' type of argument. Worse still is if they get more bolshie and decide to sneak 'whatever' out of the house to use/wear at other times. (Memories from my own childhood surfacing -sorry Mum <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/redface.gif"/> <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/biggrin.gif"/>.)

I'm going to let her open the presents so she can see what they were and then I'm going to take the most unsuitable one(s) off her after discussing why I feel they are inappropriate. She already understands there is a difference between the way we raise her and the way her friend is raised so I dont think it will come as too much of a shock to her. Whether she understands enough to be happy about it or not is a different matter. <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/wink.gif"/> I've already found out about the nail thing as suggested by JTW and there is a place local (ish) to us who can issue a fancy gift voucher so I'm going to have that ready to suggest as a replacement treat for when I take the other thing off her. She's quite 'girly' so I think she'd really like that better anyway tbh.

I also want to say that my thoughts above are only that.... my thoughts. I'm happy I'm doing the right thing for us, that doesn't mean everyone should parent the same way and we all need to make choices we feel comfortable with. Thanks again for all your thoughts. I hope your Christmas present opening is calm and peaceful. <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

I think that's the right decision, Alias. If the item really is as clear-cut as the FCUK example <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/speechless-smiley-040.gif"/>, then yes, I can totally see where you're coming from. <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/smile.gif"/>

And what is it with t-shirts with slogans? :rolleyes: Not just Playboy and stuff - I used to not let DSs wear tops they were given along the lines of, "Here comes trouble", or "I'm just back from the naughty step!" as I didn't feel I wanted a 2-yr-old labelled in such a way, even jokingly. Maybe I'm over-contolling, but ha, if the child is 2, I decide what they wear! <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/laughing-smiley-014.gif"/>

I don't like those slogans on teeshirts for children either.

you've edited your post is see i have kids and i know about parenting and if you dont like,my comments tough

ive not made them personal ive simply pointed out youve deceived your daughter by going through her presents thats wrong
</quote>
My edit was because I made a comment about you having issue with something I said elsewhere previously. I felt your comments were personal and I suggested it might be better if you put me on ignore.

I then removed that comment because I felt it served no purpose other than to inflame things further.

Btw....comments like 'you have no life......etc' are personal.

And at what point have I lied to my daughter? I would like you to answer that question specifically please.

Edited to add: Actually I'd like to know how I deceived her too? The definition of deceive is 'To cause to believe what is not true; mislead '

So how does unwrapping and rewrapping a present = deceiving someone?

I find your views to be quite immature and naive tbh.
