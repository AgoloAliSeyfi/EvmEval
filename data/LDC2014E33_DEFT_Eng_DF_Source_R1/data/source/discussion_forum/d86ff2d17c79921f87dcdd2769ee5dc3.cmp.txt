The Catholic Church is opposed to contraception for moral reasons.

Where is the morality in creating a life when food and clean water are rare commodities? Where poverty exists and educational opportunities are non existent?

Where is the morality when disease is spread?

Where is the morality when a women is the victim of domestic violence? When a women is forced to conceive and then trapped as the child become a lever to gain more power and more control?

The Catholic Church speaks to all of these things, dumbass.

It also speaks out against the death penalty.

I am with you.

If you cant feed, house and take care of a baby you have no business having one.

Yup, if you can't provide for the child don't have it.

If you can't provide, don't get pregnant.

Personally, I'm a fan of contraception.

As far as your questions about the morality of other issues, I would bet the Church also views those as important.

However, when it comes to the soul and the physical being, in the Church's eyes, the soul trumps the former. And, they have always wanted more souls to watch over. Fill that basket, you know.

Not my view, either. But, I'm not the Church.

And, I have no interest in telling the Church what to do (as if they'd listen anyway); I just cast my 'vote' concerning the Church with my feet. But, as I am a big fan of the Constitution, I sure as hell don't want my government telling the Church or any other religious organization what is kosher to believe and what isn't.

If the Church believes that the soul is more important than the physical being, that is their prerogative.

(I won't be joining them or 'going back' anytime soon, though.)

So, in your opinion, a church which engages in animal sacrifice or practices polyandry/polygamy should be beyond the reach of law?

Actually, I'm a fan of the First Amendment and agree with the SCOTUS on what few limitations we place on it.

Not in this country they are not. The church is a global institution.... or have you missed the catholic charities commercials with the starving children in third world countries with no water, food, shelter or education?

</quote>

Oh yes I've seen the commercials. but I don't trust everything ad I see on TV.
