I find this fascinating. Obama's approval ratings are hovering below 50%, yet he has made the list for the 4th year in a row. To me, this says that Americans are willing to give Obama the benefit of the doubt in 2012. Once his re-election campaign is in full gear, his accomplishments will come into the light (his failures have been made all too apparent by Fox News.)

Perhaps they are starting to realize that the president isn't a cure-all for a damaged economy. They understand that that there are many other factors to be considered (i.e. the politics of Congress).

That, of course, is just my opinion.

And an opinion based on very little meaningful analysis it is.

The poll asked about 1000 people who they admired the most: About 170 said "Obama."

That means 830 admired someone ELSE.

What I find fascinating is..
Palin came in fourth, and George Bush came in second..

so because Obama made most admired guy that means the people are going to give him the benefit of doubt..

It wasn't a poll on which President you admired the most...good grief

He's at the top of the list for the 4th year in a row. Obviously him being president has something to do with it.

of course he is. Hes a good family man and has been a below average President. Hes a very likable guy and he has my vote. Not one GOP member can come close to his family values, which is overly ironic at best.

the guy is easy to like and respect, except if you are not of an open mind.

It helps that the media hasn't given him the same anal-probing the GOP field has gotten.

Kim Jong Ill was extremely popular in his country. Thousands were literally bawling at his funeral. Just goes to show you what good press can do for a poor leader.
