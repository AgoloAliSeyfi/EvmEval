Yes, and you guys at back-to-sleepy SFB can split your PGF Munns thread into a "whine about JREF skeptics" thread. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

You're right. All my stuff about SFB/ABS/Melissa and friends is pretty OT. I don't feel particularly bad about it because whenever I try to discuss why you couldn't have had a sleep-related occurence or distorted memory we get about as far as "I saw what I saw".

You and everyone here can discuss your opinions about my encounter all you want. I listen to all of them, but I am not required to subscribe to them.

If there's any complaint, I could maybe try something lame and say "well didn't the ABS think they might have seen Bigfoot eyeshine?"

The key word there is "might". Eyeshine is not proof. And we do not
submit it is such. You are confusing someone telling about a experience on a radio show as submitting it as evidence. Speaking of lame.

I know, not much finesse. What I find frustrating about situations like this is that I have a conflict between not wanting to be OT (even in a more open thread like this) and adding yet another Bigfoot thread to the pile while more than a few are active. With all the silliness that happened with Bullet Maker doing a lemming run off the face of Bigfootery, I've kind of been giving poor Darren Lee and the MABRC a break and Melissa and friends kookery have put the ABS in my sights, particularly with what a gong show the SFSP expedition was. May be I will start a thread similar to my MABRC threads and call it "American Bigfoot Society - The Mild Bunch." If I do, I expect you to do a good job handing it back to the "scoftics". <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

Kit one of the first things you and I ever spoke about regarding Bigfoot was Mr Bilby and his hoaxing. You do understand that most in this field never bought into anything he said or did, correct? He admitted hoaxing to me,
I posted it for all to see, and he is done and good riddence.

Please do not infer that the ABS has anything to do with hoaxing by comparing us to Bullet maker. That is really crossing a line. You know that none of us in the ABS will stand for hoaxing. You may continue your silly personal attacks on mself or the research techniques applied, but do not go there.

ETA: Heeey... wait a minute. Rob Gaudet is an ABS and MABRC member. He's another one of those exhibitionist youtube Bigfooters. I forgot about that:

Rob's a riot:

Great, now you want to make fun of a man that neither one of us know anything about.
