I have had my mortgage with the Woolwich since the year 2000, but havent lived in my property in the North East since 2005 when I was made redundant and temporarily moved to Leeds. At this point I contacted the Woolwich and explained the situation and they gave me permission to rent out my flat on a temporary basis.

However, the temporary move seems to be pretty permanent and I am now happily settled in a house with my girlfriend (which she owns). We have only recently moved in together so I need to change my correspondence address so my mortgage company can contact me if need be. I am wary about doing this as I am unable to find the letter that agreed to me letting out my flat. I can find a letter that states they received my letter asking permission, but not one that they have agreed. An added complication is that my mortgage is now with Barclays since they took over the Woolwich. I am told that when lenders agree to this, its on a short term basis. 7 years isnt short term so I am paranoid that when I change my correspondence address, that will be when things fall apart and I find I have not stuck to the terms of my mortgage arrangement or something.

I wouldnt be able to change to a buy to let mortgage. Not only do I not have the funds for this, but I am in the 3rd year of an IVA.

Can anyone offer any words of wisdom/advice/experience of their own? Or am I being a fairy and just worrying too much?

Thanks in advance.

Can't you sell?

Hopefully you have been declaring this income to the taxman?

MY IVA complicates the selling suggestion. I would I struggle to meet my IVA monthly payments AND my mortgage payments when I don't have a tenant paying me. I can't advertise it while its occupied. Bit of a catch 22. Plus I don't think I can sell my property during my IVA (I will double check this) as I will need to release some equity during the final year.

TBH you've got away with this temporary arrangement for this long and I'm surprised they've not been in touch to 'review' it. Can only see them wanting to convert to BTL if/when they find out.

And the tax issue?
