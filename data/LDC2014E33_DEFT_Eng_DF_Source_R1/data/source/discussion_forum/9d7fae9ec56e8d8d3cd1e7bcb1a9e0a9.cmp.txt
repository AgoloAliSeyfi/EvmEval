"States' rights" is more libertarian/conservative nonsense. It shifts power away from the people, because corporations can far more easily lobby a state government than they can a federal government. Thus, you'd have some weird collusion of business and government that reminisces fascism, rather than "power to the people."

This is evidenced by the fact that auto makers have gotten the states to pit themselves against each other a few times, to see which state can come up with the most handouts, land develop, and so on for the corporations. Mercedes-Benz and a few other auto manufacturers basically have treated the US like a third world country because of this.

Look at history: Women's rights, civil rights, the environmental movements, and so on, all appealed to the federal government to get things done, and the constitution had to be even amended to fix problems that were generally an issue of states' being oppressive, again, like civil rights.

What in the world is the obsession with conservatives and moving humanity backwards? It's like what the great FDR said (who's advice we could use just about now): "A conservative is a man with two perfectly good legs who, however, has never learned to walk forward. "

and

"The liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it comes stronger than their democratic state itself. That, in its essence, is fascism - ownership of government by an individual, by a group or by any controlling private power." Truly, the last democratic president the US ever had.

No, we don't need to return to the Gilded Age and pre-anti-monopoly, anti-trust laws.

No, we don't need to repeal women's right to vote, as Ann Coulter etc. have suggested.

No, we don't need to bring back slavery and the Civil War, or the "confederacy."

No, we don't need to believe that the earth is a few thousand years old like our "christian founders."

No, we don't need to return to isolationism in regards to foreign affairs.

N, we don't need to devolve power down to the states any more than they already have, which is plenty.

They should be able to deal with school districts and minor issues like that, so long as they don't violate federal curriculum, or federal law (i.e. creationism, racism, etc.).

They should be able to elect governors and so on.

They should NOT be able to enact a mini-fascist society like the people at the "Free"-state project want, who's efforts by the way have totally failed in terms of both popular support and actual implementation.

The type of state power you speak of is not what I envision...instead, and to simplify, I think the states are better equipped to spend the money (intended to benefit citizens and infrastructure of the state) which Washington allocates to the state (period).

I actually agree with you across several points...I see fascism growing around/from the logistics of the bailout. Read this definition/description.

As for turning back the clock... trust the voting majority. I think an active local political climate with enhanced voter interest will always be our best defense against a true fascist threat. We the People need to stay involved and make our votes count.

Publius (Madison) elaborates on the subject:

<quote>
... The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce; with which last the power of taxation will, for the most part, be connected. The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people, and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State...

...But if the government be national with regard to the operation of its powers, it changes its aspect again when we contemplate it in relation to the extent of its powers. The idea of a national government involves in it, not only an authority over the individual citizens, but an indefinite supremacy over all persons and things, so far as they are objects of lawful government. Among a people consolidated into one nation, this supremacy is completely vested in the national legislature. Among communities united for particular purposes, it is vested partly in the general and partly in the municipal legislatures. In the former case, all local authorities are subordinate to the supreme; and may be controlled, directed, or abolished by it at pleasure. In the latter, the local or municipal authorities form distinct and independent portions of the supremacy, no more subject, within their respective spheres, to the general authority, than the general authority is subject to them, within its own sphere. In this relation, then, the proposed government cannot be deemed a national one; since its jurisdiction extends to certain enumerated objects only, and leaves to the several States a residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects. It is true that in controversies relating to the boundary between the two jurisdictions, the tribunal which is ultimately to decide, is to be established under the general government. But this does not change the principle of the case. The decision is to be impartially made, according to the rules of the Constitution;
