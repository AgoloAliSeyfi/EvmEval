"I am conscious that an equal division of property is impracticable, but the consequences of this enormous inequality producing so much misery to the bulk of mankind, legislators cannot invent too many devices for subdividing property, only taking care to let their subdivisions go hand in hand with the natural affections of the human mind. The descent of property of every kind therefore to all the children, or to all the brothers and sisters, or other relations in equal degree, is a politic measure and a practicable one. Another means of silently lessening the inequality of property is to exempt all from taxation below a certain point, and to tax the higher portions or property in geometrical progression as they rise " -- Thomas Jefferson; letter to James Madison (October 28, 1785)

So we can count on your support of confiscatory inheritance taxes?
I would like to know what right the federal government has in the taking of property that undoubtedly has been taxed many times over just because someone had the wherewithal to safeguard and put it good use before they passed from this life?
Why should a family farm for example have to be sold off to donate 55% of the proceeds to the federal government?
Why should a husband and wife who busted their asses to accumulate an estate to pass on to their children see over half of it land in the hands of government bureaucrats who will then take that money and spend it on utter nonsense?
A word of caution.....If you want you head bitten off and treated as spewtum, give me that "civic duty" or "the price of freedom" bullshit....

Don't forget that the Parliament that oppressed the colonists were members of a landed aristocracy, so this was a great concern to the likes of Jefferson. I don't think that a flat 55% rate is fair or conducive to "the great object." A progressive rate like that that Jefferson speaks of would be far better.

Of course it would. However, try convincing those in the class envy and war on wealth people on the political Left.
