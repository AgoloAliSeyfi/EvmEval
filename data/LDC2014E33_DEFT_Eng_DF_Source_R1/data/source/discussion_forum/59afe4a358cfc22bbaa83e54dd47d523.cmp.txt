That was one of the most pointless replies I've ever seen. Instead of defending McCain, you went on an attack against Obama. Try staying on subject:

McCain is a foreign policy disaster in the making.

The weirdest thing that wingers don't get is that defining people as 'Liberal' or 'Leftist' doesn't mean that they're wrong or bad:

In the 1960s we were a terrible nation. We were at war fighting against the sovereignty of the Vietnamese people. WE WERE THE BAD GUYS!!!

That war violated every principle that America was founded on.

The treatment of non-white people was attrocious. Few people under the age of 50 remember how bad it was.

While the personal suffering of individuals who were killed by leftist bombers is a horrible thing, these leftist radicals were fighting for a just cause. In the end they won. This country changed dramatically because of them.

At the same time, does John McCain ever consider the people that he most likely killed or maimed? He believed in his cause, but that doesn't mean that he should completely disregard the innocent people that were killed by his bombs:

A bomber in a neat uniform with a nice haircut, flying a jet airplane is still A BOMBER.

Not one word from him of concern for these people.

Why Liberals don't normally win the Presidency....
It's funny you put a hit piece about a man who fought for his country and sacrificed physically. A man who refused early release so that he didn't abandon his fellow soliders. While you defend radicals that bomb innocent people. MCcain followed the orders he was given by his commanders and I don't think you will find too many democrats that will support a position of our soliders being some type of thugs. While there are a few democrats on here that will support that, you all are the minority even in your party(at least I hope so).

I can find a lot of faults with McCain but his sevice to our country isn't one of them. He has a lot of experience where foregn policy is concerned, but I disagree with most of his positions on Middle East affairs that seem to have got us bogged down fighting a war on 2 fronts. I doubt he would show much restraint where military force is concerned.

I am glad you support the troops....

Although, I disagree that Mccain will send troops into harm's way at every whim.

McCain is losing it. Everytime I see him speak, there is a pause and then his ingratiating little smile or smirk appears. I never trusted people who laugh at their own so called funnies even when they aren't funny.

He calls Obama an elitist while he Mc Cain owns 5 homes and his wife is worth 600 million. He talks about his religious foundations, but he cheated on his first wife and divorced her when she gained weight after taking prescribed medicine after an accident. He was against the tax breaks and drilling and is now for it.

He says he backs the troops but has consistently voted against bills that support more education and medical benefits.

It's his last time, he knows it, and will say or do what ever he needs to to win.

And no one is pushing the Singing Songbird of Hanoi angle. The left doesn't has the skill the right had in twisting Kerry's service with the TurdBoat veterans. Part of the right success in the mud slinging is their audience,

Obama worked his way up, but McCain slept his way to the top with his wife's mob money.
