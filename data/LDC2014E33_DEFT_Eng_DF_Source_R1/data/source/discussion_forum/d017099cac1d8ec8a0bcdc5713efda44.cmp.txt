You're prabably expecting an emotional plea. This isn't one.

I've read so many 9/11 conspiracy theorist threads I'm practically an expert. OK, I'm not not engineer or architect or pilot, which will surprise no-one who has ever had to delete one of my posts, but for God's sake, it's just reached risible levels now.

Sooner or later every debunker reaches the stage where they just want to whack the miscreant round the head and tell him not to be stupid.

They're faced with facts. They ignore them.

They're faced with evidence. The evidence is lies.

They're faced with bloody horrific in your face proof that they're wrong and they ask silly childish questions about millisecond anomolies.

I shouldn't want to punch the nincompoops, but I do.

So why do I still wish sense to be bashed into their silly heads?

Quite simply because they're pissing on the graves of those who died.

If someone you cared about was murdered, for whatever reason, and the perpetrator was exonerated, if that's the word I want, in favour of an innocent party, I'd be pretty bloody upset. The same principle applies here. Those who died on 9/11 deserve better than to have their murderers excused as puppets, or whatever the latest fantasy they've dreamed up is. It's too sick.

Well, that's it. That's why I no longer laugh at them. I prefer to spit.

Those idiots at the memorial last week...hmmm, let's just say, I wish everyone there had just flicked the V sign at them and thrown the odd bottle of urine, just as if it was a crap band on the stage.

p.s. admittedly I did get a little emotional, but not in a good way.

Everybody is a foreigner to somebody else.

Besides, your country is a country of foreigners, it's what drove its progress from the beginning.

Many family members of 911 victims are skeptical of the government's account. Perhaps you better inform them to their faces that they are pissing on their loved ones' graves.

Actually, you won't find very many of them supporting truther lies. I'd love to see your stinking group left in a room with all the relatives of those who died. I'd love to see you try and tell them what you think happened. You'd be lucky to get out alive.
