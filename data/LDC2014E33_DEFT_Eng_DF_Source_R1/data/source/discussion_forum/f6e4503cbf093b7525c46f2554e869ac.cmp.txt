I agree. In these troubled times we simply cannot do without this significant portion of potential enlistees, and talented senior members, to uphold an absurd, and bigoted, policy. Most absurdly, we are allowing ourselves to fire Arabic language specialists, people whose positions are critical at this time, due to a trait that has no effect on the performance of their duties.

I know congress has a lot on their plates right now, but they need to move on this soon. Preferably with a solution that would allow soldiers lost to this idiotic policy to reenlist if they still wish to.

This isn't something that takes a great deal of work or effort. I think a one page bill will do it.

"If a member of the US Military is openly gay, he or she may serve honorably with everyone else in the military."

Republicans disagree with it - ok, they disagree with it. That's their problem. It doesn't effect them. It effects the people who want to serve in our military but can't. We did this for African Americans, we did this for women, now it's time to do it for gays.

The military is designed to protect our nation and that is their top priority first and foremost.

If anything gets in the way of that being accomplished, the military seeks to remove it.

Having soldiers that are openly gay sparks contention among troops, resulting in lower morale, less teamwork, and overall a lack of professionalism.

There is no discrimination against gays. They can join the military if they want.

However, they cannot make an issue out of their homosexuality by declaring it to other soldiers. Similarly, any form of sexual misconduct on the parts of heterosexuals is also prohibited and they cannot inquire as to what another soldier's sexuality is.

Overall, the military is lean, mean fighting machine, not a Manhattan cocktail party.

Are you suggesting that our military members can't handle working with someone who is openly gay?

I served with a few men and women who were very obviously gay, it didn't bother me or seem to bother others around them at the time. I don't think if they came out and said what everyone already knew things would have changed much. Well, other then them being discharged and all that jazz.

how was your military experience affected by DADT?

My brother wasn't allowed to serve because he is openly gay. Instead he became a firefighter and almost gave his life on 9/11.

Let me see here - if you're good enough to save lives on 9/11 and almost give your life, you're NOT good enough to save lives and give your life for your country?

My brother is my family. That's how it effects me. Perhaps you don't give two shits about your family, but my family and I are thicker than thieves.
