Krugman got the Nobel prize for economics, not peace. However, he's still an idiot. Put him in a room with any halfway intelligent free market economist and he turns into a blubbering moron. I've seen some debates where Krugman's opponent had him practically in tears.

Sit him down with Walter Williams. It would be priceless.

I think such an encounter actually occurred. However, I'm not certain of it.

Krugman laments in his Nov. 3 New York Times column "Oligarchy, American Style," "We have a society in which money is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few people, and in which that concentration of income and wealth threatens to make us a democracy in name only."

I'd ask Krugman this question: Who's putting all the money in the hands of the few, and what do you think ought to be done to stop millions, perhaps billions, of people from using their money in ways that lead to high income and wealth concentration? In other words, I'd like Krugman to tell us what should be done to stop the millions of children who make Joanne Rowling rich, the millions who fork over their money to the benefit of LeBron James, and the hundreds of millions of people who shop at Wal-Mart.

I'd like to end this discussion with a bit of a personal note. The readers of this column know that I never make charges of racism. Rowling is an author, and so am I. In my opinion, my recently published book "Race and Economics: How Much Can Be Blamed on Discrimination?" is far more important to society than any "Harry Potter" novel. I'd like to know what it is about me that explains why millions upon millions have not purchased my book and made me a billionaire author. Maybe Krugman and the Wall Street occupiers have the answer.

You're getting your position on other people's intelligence from Paul Krugman. 'Nuff said.

He's only a Nobel Prize winner.

Why do wingnuts hate intelligence?

I'm not a huge fan, but I have to give credit where credit is due and he's wiping the floor with the republican field in these debates. I wish Paul was a little bit more articulate and less frenetic in his responses. He definitely offers the most substance in his replies, but a lot gets lost in translation. Romney is a milquetoast douchewagon who can't even give a straight answer to a simple question like 'do the states have the right to ban contraception?'

Get used to the idea of 4 more years of the Oh-Boy. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/thup.gif"/>

that was a stupid question and didn't deserve and answer.. and that's the truth. ruth.

Did Manifold say Obama was wiping the field with the Republicans in the debates? Um... does he know that Obama isn't debating the Republicans?

</quote>

I don't think he said that. More likely, he said that the winner of these GOP debates is Obama. Because he is.
