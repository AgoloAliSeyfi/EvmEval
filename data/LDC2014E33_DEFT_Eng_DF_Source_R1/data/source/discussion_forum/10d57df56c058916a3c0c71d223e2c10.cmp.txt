Wow, this guy is a moron. No wonder you wingnuts like him. It's all deflection and misdirection.

This is an economist who doesn't know about monopolies, cartels and collusion?

Nobody has included LeBron as among 'the few'. More like the NBA owners, who have a monopoly. Or like oil companies, who have a cartel. As does cable TV, who have both.

Everything you know about monopolies, cartels and collusion. There has never been a monopoly in this country that wasn't government enforced. Cartels always fall apart.

The NBA is a classic example of a government enforced monopoly. OPEC has never been able to enforce any of its quotas on production or prices. Cable monopolies are all government enforced.

All you did is demonstrate your complete ignorance.

No wonder you're a Krugman fan.

You left out oil companies, Braniac. There are a few who control the entire market.

Are you saying that if a government doesn't break up a monopoly (cable), it is enforcing the monopoly?

I'm not a huge fan, but I have to give credit where credit is due and he's wiping the floor with the republican field in these debates. I wish Paul was a little bit more articulate and less frenetic in his responses. He definitely offers the most substance in his replies, but a lot gets lost in translation. Romney is a milquetoast douchewagon who can't even give a straight answer to a simple question like 'do the states have the right to ban contraception?'

Get used to the idea of 4 more years of the Oh-Boy. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/thup.gif"/>

I mentioned OPEC, dipstick. I'll repeat, despite having no legal hindrances, OPEC has been unable to enforce any of its production quotas or price limits.

Government created the cable monopoly. Virtually every city in the country grants a monopoly to one cable company or another. that is, they legally exclude any other company from providing services in the area.

Every true monopoly that has ever existed has been government enforced.
