I never ONCE said that there was no sexism. There is sexism, racism, homophobia, etc...all in politics. What I said was is that the candidates were not treated any differently by the media (and that includes pundits) based on whether they were conservative or liberal.

I don't care what you "say" is supposedly true. I have read articles written by women who experienced the bias first hand,and later talked about it openly via the media curcuit (see Geraldine Ferraro and Hillary Clinton). I will take their word for it thanks. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_hand.gif"/>

There is no bias. WOMEN are subject to sexism in politics...it is not unique to one party or the other. Minorities are subject to bigotry in politics...no party bias needed. What don't you get?

That you are telling me Laura Bush was treated the same as Michelle Obama?

ROFL!

Don't come in here spouting there is no sexist bias in the liberal media,then refuse to back up your claims and expect to be taken seriously. It don't wash. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_hand.gif"/>

Neither does deflection.

I will give you one example of different treatment. Watch the Chris Matthews show when he has a Liberal guest. It is all fun, smiles, agreement and a few softball questions. Then watch him interview a Conservative guest and get back to me.

That is the case on almost every show all day long on MSNBC. I call it the AOATT network since it is All Obama All The Time.

And pundits on Fox are different how exactly? Have you watched a Hannity "interview" (gush, gush)...

EXCUSE ME AGAIN!

But while everyone is donning sackclothe and ashes over some supposed slurs thrown toward Amy and Chelsea (for which I have yet to see a scintilla of evidence.)

Does anyone remember how Juanita Broaderick was treated? Lewinsky? Paula Jones?

It was like I was back in high school.

The SAME SEXIST DOUBLE STANDARD that feminists supposedly were fighting against WAS ENSHRINED IN PUBLIC POLICY AND THEY TOOK IT DOWN IT EVEN ATTACKING FIVE YEAR OLDS!

Bill Clinton was some "victim" of his hormones. "I mean he couldn't help himself. After all he's a guy!" Poor wittle Bill Clinton.

And the women were "nuts and sluts!"

The guy is a hero and a victim, the girl is a gutter slut!

And the same feminists who were going after sexual harrassment after the Anita Hill debacle failed to take down Clarence Thomas, took their rage on the road and started attacking five years olds with "sexual harrassment."

But the same people who went after five year olds for "kissing a girls buttons," suddenly turned a blind eye when it came to Old Billy Boy!

Bubba was a victim and feminists went so far as to write they would get on their hands and knees and give Bubba a Lewinsky as long as he kept abortion legal.

ANYONE REMEMBER THAT? I SURE AS HELL DO!

And anyone want to remember how the BUSH TWINS WERE TREATED.

Comedy Central was even doing "That's my Bush" with the Bush Twins as incestuous lesbians.

And you libs claim oppression over Chelsea and Amy?

HAR DE HAR HAR!

What selective memories you all have!

Notice how liberals won't address the different treatment the women against Clinton got?

You state the candidates were not treated differently...then when showed you are wrong... can't even back up your BS with anything other than your useless bluster. What don't you get? This ain't hard.
