O.K. WHERE were the "Tea Partiers" in late '08!!!!?????

</quote>

All the eveidence shows this to be a new movement that is unprecedented. They had no organization or organizational skills and maybe even a lack of awarness as to how many people were in the "club". Thesea are middle classed people, middle aged people without a history of rallies or marches.

They are not made up of the usual zombietime bums, college students or ACORN bussed in hacks and SEIU union thugs or commie funded ANSWER geeks. The Tea Party people are working stiffs with day jobs and families. They are a pissed off and unaffiliated new breed of political monster that no one knows what to make of yet.

But we do know what created them, Pelosi/Reid/Obama greed!

Pretty much...I quit listening to him because he's such a damned negative Nancy.

In any case, he was busting pretty hard on the administration and the (R) congress for spending like crazy.

</quote>

Savage and Boortz were going pretty nuts too.

And in the end, Bush's poll numbers were circling the drain because of his spending... among other things.

</quote>

Iraq was the primary reason for his numbers tanking.

</quote>

i thought it was because bush was not conservative enough. hahahahaha

They "have" FOX because FOX News reports on newsworthy events. (like a rally in Washington bigger than MLK's... that's "news")

Corporate sponsors by the "buttload"? Can you name three?
