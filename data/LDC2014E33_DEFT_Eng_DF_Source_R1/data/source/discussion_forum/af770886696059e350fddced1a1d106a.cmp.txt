Your argument is a false analogy. Choose something more equivalent.

A land invasion may well not have succeeded. The casualties were going to be incredible even if the Allied armies managed to consolidate beach heads, much less push inland. The bombs were necessary. There is no real argument about this anymore. It's one of those flat historical facts that is indisputable.

That must be why you work so hard to avoid simple questions. Quentin posted a boat load of facts you people won't even pretend to address.

If new facts invalidate the old facts, the discussion is over.

He posted no facts. He cl;aimed as you have that Japan offered to surrender before the Atomic Bombs, that is a BALD FACED lie. All Japan offered was to cease the war and return to the 1941 start lines. And after one bomb they still demanded their terms be meet.

It took 2 bombs, a Soviet Invasion AND the DIRECT intervention of the Emperor to end the war. Even then the Army attempted a Coup.

He posted no facts? Holy fuck. Dishonest people like you should have to pay other posters.

You completely ignored the question in 196. You claimed my facts are wrong but haven't done a fuxxing thing to support that claim. Damn namvet.....are you ever honest on this issue?

I was fully prepared for you to try and jump on that and had Leahy's quote from his book ready to use in response. What you fail to understand is his prediction that it would not go off has absolutely nothing to do with the fact he said the bombs were not necessary.
