It was understood at the time that unless the Japanese surrendered, we would lose as many as a half a million to a million of our fighting men to finally defeat the Japanese Empire. And the Japanese were not going to surrender. The citizenry was being trained in how to fight to the last man, woman and child.

It took the atomic bomb to prove to them that it was futile. And even the first one didn't turn the trick.

Compared to how many of OUR soldiers' lives were at stake -- not even counting the many fold MORE Japanese lives that would be lost -- the math alone underscores a tragic (but real) morality in going atomic.

A horrible, horrifying and wrenching decision by President Truman? Absolutely.

But immoral?

Based on the quantification of human life, the decision was far more moral than the alternative.

This is the same exact line that's been proven wrong on several levels.

The bombs did not make Japan change its conditions for surrender. At. All.

The conditions of surrender were not Japan's.

They were ours.

The atomic bombs sure as hell DID make Japan acquiesce to them.

Your bogus and unsupported claim that this "line" has been "proven [sic] wrong on several levels" is bullshit. Of course, bullshit is your sole stock in trade, so it's no surprise you'd say such dishonest shit. At. All.

This is the last time I respond when you rely on another poster to state my source instead of asking me directly or ignoring the fact I've pointed to the same article at least three times:

"Walter Trohan, JAPS ASKED PEACE IN JAN. ENVOYS ON WAY  TOKYO Chicago Tribune, August 19, 1945."

The stupidity never ends for you does it? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/clap2.gif"/>

This is what makes reading your posts worthwhile: The Entertainment Value

Anyone! Try to go to the source above and see if there's an offer of "Unconditional Surrender."

You're a fucking dumbass no matter what issue you try to debate and you prove it once again. The Official US policy before the bombs was an "Unconditional Surrender." After the bombs it was the US that gave in to Japan's terms you ignorant fuck.

"On August 10, 1945, Japan offered to surrender to the Allies, the only condition being that the emperor be allowed to remain the nominal head of state."

"On August 12, the United States announced that it would accept the Japanese surrender, making clear in its statement that the emperor could remain in a purely ceremonial capacity only."

You keep ignoring the fact Leahy clearly stated the bombs were not necessary for Japan to surrender. Why? Because you aren't here to discuss anything. You're a parasite.
