Oh and <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/victim-penn-state-officials-rejected-claims-university-professor/story?id=14960575#.TsM_enLnPzs">while we're at it</a> :

McLaughlin said, after repressing the memories of his alleged abuse, that he decided to confront Neisworth over the phone in 2001 as part of his therapy. He tape-recorded the conversation, in which he claims that the professor admitted to performing oral sex on him.

"I was in the process of trying to get him to open up about some of the sexual acts and what not, and he actually interrupted me and says, 'Do you remember driving up on the hill?'" McLaughin said. "I said, 'Wasn't that the first time you went down on me?' He said, 'I don't know if it was the first time but it was certainly fierce,' was his words."

Over the course of a few months from the end of 2001 into early 2002, McLaughlin said he sent his taped conversation with Neisworth to university officials, but each time he was "rejected."

"They didn't want copies of the tape recorded conversation. They didn't want to hear it, period," he said. "It was extremely emotional for me to have to make these calls to begin with, but then to be rejected the way I was and basically treated as if I had done something wrong in making those calls."

McLaughlin said he spoke with one Penn State official on the phone at the time who refused to even investigate his claim.

"They said don't bother sending it we're not interested in fabrications, stories, any attempts at extortion or blackmail. I mean, they made it seem like I was looking for something for myself," McLaughlin said. "I didn't ask them for money. I didn't ask them for anything other than make sure they look into this. Listen to the tape and get this guy away from children."

McLaughlin said he also spoke with former Penn State president Graham Spanier on the phone within two weeks of allegations being made about former defensive football coach Jerry Sandusky sexually abusing young boys. Spanier and head football coach Joe Paterno were fired last week in the wake of the accusations, which were first reported on Nov. 5. McLaughlin said he was met with the same "hostility" that he had received from other university officials.

"[Spanier] told me that as far as he was concerned it was hearsay, '[Neisworth] has an impeccable record. He has never been accused of anything,'" McLaughlin said. "They were more interested in protecting the school. They didn't seem to have any interest in protecting children at all."

Neisworth was later charged with multiple counts of child sexual abuse in Cecil County, Md., in 2005. However, McLaughlin claimed that at the time, Penn State officials said an indictment wasn't enough to investigate one of their faculty members.

I heard the Bob Costas interview.

OK, if you want to shower with kids, there is something wrong with your brain. I mean, there is something physically wrong with your brain.

If you want to have sleep overs with kids (as in, M.J. did), there is also something wrong with your brain. I mean, there is something physically wrong with your brain.

Why doesn't anyone else see this?

Wow, his defense attorney got an underage client of his pregnant some years back?

What, did this attorney think to himself, "Well that would be uncomfortable if brought up, but what are the chances of that. It's not like anyone's paying that much attention to this case."?
