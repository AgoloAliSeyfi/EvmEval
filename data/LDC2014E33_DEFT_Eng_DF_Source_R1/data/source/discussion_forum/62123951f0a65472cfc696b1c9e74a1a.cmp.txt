I didn't realize the CDC was worried about someone passing cancer to someone else sitting on a bus with them. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

You have such a simpleton mind that I'm amazed you haven't been run over by a lawn mower yet. Hopefully you are sterile.

The internet exposes you kooks hiding in your trailers.

Enjoy voting for the founding father of Obamacare and still holding a straight face while you tell everyone how conservative you are.

Thanks again, have a great day <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/razz.gif"/>

If I recall you're only 26 years old. I suggest you live a little longer before you broadcast your opinions as anything more than that, or characterize someone like me as a "lib". Using "lib" as a pejorative, in effect suggesting all "lib"s are the same and hold only far left opinions is abject ignorance. I've been on this planet for twice as many years and more than you, and experience counts.

I believe universal preventative health care should be provided to all citizens; I believe in gun controls; I believe the war on drugs and the war on poverty have failed; I believe in fiscal sanity; I believe in the rule of law and that our Constitution is a living document; I believe CU v. FEC is the greatest threat to our democratic traditions and to our Republic; I believe violent criminals need to be incarcerated in prison and if paroled should be supervised for life; I believe drug offenders need to be punished for their crimes and treated for their addictions; I believe all citizens between the age of 16 and 32 should should provide two years of service to the nation; I believe in the rights of states but the rights of all citizens are supreme; and, I believe that all citizens have a duty to vote and that any effort to place roadblocks to their exercising this franchise as well as anyone who votes fraudulently should be punished upon conviction by incarceration.

See, I can write all of this without attacking you personally or using an emoticon. You can thank my 'liberal' college professors at CAL for this ability. I can also defend my beliefs in appropriate threads, and would enjoy debates with those who disagree and can do so without the use of emoticons or logical fallacies.

Well I am glad to finally read a few things that you disagree with Obama on. However, I don't see how someone can be against the War on Drugs and support fiscal sanity AND support Obama, when his views are the exact opposite on the subject.

Wanting a guy who gets in a bar fight supervised for life seems awfully extreme.

Most of the views you just posted are liberal, so I'm not sure why me calling you a liberal resulted in this kind of a response.

I consider people, at least in a fiscal sense, liberal if they support big expensive government programs. Like the ones you listed, and like this one on this thread that GoneBezerk adamantly defends.

40 years of medical practice and sound investments in gold and silver, that's how.

Idiot.

Paul has not be a practicing Doctor for 40 years. It's more like 20 years. And a good deal of his professional career has been spent in congress.

The 1980's were 40 years ago? I'm older than I thought.

Paul and his wife then relocated to Texas, where he began a private practice in obstetrics and gynecology. [12] He refused to accept Medicaid or Medicare payments; he routinely lowered fees for patients who could not afford to pay.[13][14]

He hasn't practiced since the early 90's at the latest, but Sallow's claim was that he hadn't practiced in 40 years which was inaccurate.
