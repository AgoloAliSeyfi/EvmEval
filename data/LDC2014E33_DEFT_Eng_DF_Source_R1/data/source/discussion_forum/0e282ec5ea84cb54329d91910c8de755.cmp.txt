i'm not talking about sykess,, i'm talking about the guy you voted for,, the most powerful person on the planet,, laughing at the kidney failure and subsequent death of a talk show host that he and the left have made no bones about is their political enemy.. how demeaning,, how not to be dignified..

Ann Coulter didn't laugh. She said that someone should MURDER a sitting USSC justice. And you are excusing it cause shes "not the president". Obama never said anything about Limbaugh, despite the massive amount of shit Limbaugh has thrown at Obama.

did I say I excused it? DUmmie.. boy you DUmmies are DUmb..

I've brought it up multiple times. You haven't condemned it, you haven't said it was wrong of her, you haven't said anything against what she said. I don't need you to state whether you've excused it or not, by your actions its clear that you have.

I won't let you put words in my mouth.. I've said what I've said, and if you have comprehension problems I cannot help you.. I've said quite clearly the two are not in the same ball park,, one is a president and the other is a conservative political columnist,, one has power the other does not.. now go play in the basement til your mama calls you.

I never put words in your mouth. Of course you wouldn't state you excused it, because you really try very hard to avoid saying anything substantial. But you bluster, and cry, and whine about Obama &amp; Sykes, day after day after day, and can't even bring yourself to criticize Coulter. Yeah, thats excusing it. If you can't see that, you need to repeat the 2nd grade. Again.
