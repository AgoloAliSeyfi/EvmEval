All you're saying is that an income tax is not a capitation tax. No duh? Thanks for providing no useful information to the discussion.

You still haven't explained why it's just for one person to pay a higher rate on his income than another.

It only makes sense to people who have had a lobotomy.

I'm glad you understand now. I expected you to insult me once you finally understood what I mean, so thanks for that.

I tried to discuss with you before about why a flat tax would hurt the lowest earners but you ignored my question. Did you not understand that one either? I really can't hold your hand through every post here. At some point, you're going to have to figure these things out on your own.

You don't like being insulted, but you never fail to use that condescending tone whenever you disagree with someone. That's why I seldom treat leftists with respect: they are all such colossal hypocrites.

WE were discussing how it's just for one person to pay a higher rate on his income than another, not whether a flat tax hurts low wage earners. However, one consideration you continually ignore is that every flat tax proposal exempts income up to a certain point. Normally that point is well above the poverty line, so none of that actual flat tax proposals would hurt low wage earners. That would still not be paying any additional tax.

Your buddy DiamondDave wouldn't have any exemption at all, even for people at or below poverty. It was he who I was talking to originally, when you decided to butt in.

So you think people should be treated differently based on the money they make rather than being treated equal before the law...

How is that at all consistant with the idea that all men are created equal?

</quote>

Yep I think people should be taxed based on their income level.

Who ever says taxes need to conform with the ideals of equality?

</quote>

I think men should be paid more based on having a dick. See how that works?

</quote>

Well at least you're not claiming that everyone is equal in that department. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

So that means if you have a dick you pay more in taxes too.

Actually, that's not true. The tax code is full of deliberate carve outs and byzantine rules which lead to unintended results. We do not get taxed the same based on income. Even the rules of what constitutes income are complicated.

Our current tax code is the product of some social engineering, some legitimate means to fund the government, and a whole bunch of corruption in the process.

True. Our system is not as simple and ideal as I may have made it sound. There are plenty of loopholes, breaks and ways around the system that make it unfair. We need to clean up those loopholes and correct the system so the richest in our country can't continue to get richer and richer while the middle class get poorer and poorer.

Tax shelters are a thing of the past.
Tax deductions for children help everyone
Write off of mortgage interest help the less wealthy afford homes....and are invariably offset by the real estate taxes they have to pay
Tax deferred investments are income that are ultimately taxed.

I am curious what loopholes exist that you are referring to.

</quote>

asterism has explained it very well but I would add...

People still seem to think this is about INCOME tax. Its not. Never has been.

Ultimate loophole of all time is that WEALTH is taxed at a much lower rate than income. Ultra-wealthy hide wealth and therefore pay no tax on it.

GET IT?

I think you may not get it.

Wealth is not taxed at all.

Wealth is the net after taxes

Income is taxed.

The ultra wealthy dont hide wealth. They may hide income, and that is against the law......, but they do not gain anything if they hide wealth as one is not taxed on wealth.
