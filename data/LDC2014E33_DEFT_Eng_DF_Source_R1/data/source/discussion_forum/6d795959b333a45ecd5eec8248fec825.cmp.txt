I can't but I know some people who are. I think it should be a kinda cool day.... but not as cool as the 'I have a dream' thing.

"I have a dream THING". Are you being condescending or sincere? It reads as if you are being condenscending. Please excuse me if I have read it incorrectly.

Since MLK ranks as one of my "All Time Top 5 Americans", figure it out for yourself.

THE Arthur Brooks study

Arthur Brooks writes: "When it comes to giving or not giving, conservatives and liberals look a lot alike. Conservative people are a percentage point or two more likely to give money each year than liberal people, but a percentage point or so less likely to volunteer [citing the 2002 General Social Survey (GSS) and the 2000 Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey (SCCBS)]". (pp. 21-22)

So, according to THE Arthur Brooks study: conservatives believe in the giving of mammon (money) and liberals believe in the giving of themselves.

So you can't win on one argument, you choose another. So what? Liberals volunteer more, I don't buy it, but ok.

Hey pea brain...if you don't 'buy' it, then YOUR assertion is invalid. Why? IT IS THE SAME STUDY... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

I should have made myself clearer, my bad. What I'm not buying is the attempt at your
deflection from a discussion centered around donations by monetary means, to volunteering to pick up trash or ladle soup in a soup kitchen.

Is that really the card you want to play after 'hope' and 'change'?

Oh, and Glenn Beck is probably the biggest asshole I have ever seen on TV, although Sean Hannity is a pretty large one too. Bill-O isn't far behind.

</quote>

Well, I guess we all know what network YOU watch....cuz if you spent ANY time on MSNBC, you'd realize that Ed Schultz isn't only and asshole, he's a STUPID asshole...along with Keith and that other guy...what's his name...something Maddow.

Now go away or I shall mock you for a second time.
