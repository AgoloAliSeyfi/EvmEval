You apparently are very young with no problems. At the last company where I worked, one of the guys went out of our company plan, in which he was paying over $1,000 a month for family coverage, for a cheaper plan he obtained through the internet.

Everything was fine until he came down with multiple sclerosis--no previous history or family history, but they soon cancelled his coverage. They had no intention of taking care of someone who had so many medical needs.

Sure, buy internet insurance or any of those other plans--just don't get sick!

Wrong again! Do you ever tire of being wrong?

I'm well over 40. As I noted in my previous post, not particularly sickly. We do have pre-existing conditions in my family that is covered. That caused the price to be more expensive than it would otherwise.

So, you are saying that because I bought insurance through the mechanism of the Internet, that Blue Cross and Blue Shield purchased through that mechanism is different than Blue Cross purchased another way?

Wrong again. I had the policy reviewed by my mother, who owned an insurance brokerage for 30 years and she pronounced it a good policy. But, I'm sure your take on it is far superior, right?

I'm not wrong. But I don't expect the son of an insurance broker to acknowledge that the insurance companies have been fleecing the citizens of the US for decades. So your mother got you a good price? Most people aren't that fortunate.

This wasn't even a good try at a dodge. "Oh, you're just biased, so I can assume anything you say that I don't like is a lie, without any proof that it is." Not hardly. Also, he didn't say his mother got him a good price, which is so painfully obvious in his post that the only way you could have said this is if YOU are a shamelessly baldfaced liar. You should be ashamed of this post, but if you had that much integrity, you wouldn't have posted it in the first place. I'm back to wishing I had an emoticon that would let me spit in disgust.

Really? So? Did you notice that my comment about his mother was a question--not a statement?

I still stand by my opinion though. If he was brought up by someone who made her living through the health insurance industry, I don't expect him to have an unbiased opinion of a public option.

Democrats have been saying that they are all for the elimination of private health insurance. Don't believe me, watch the videos in this thread:

How many jobs will that costs? I am not just talking about the CEOs and upper management jobs but how many jobs of people like you and me who work hard every day just to put dinner on the table will be lost. From the Janitor to middle management and don't forget the little guys, the independent agents who work for you to get you coverage. Those CEO's employ you; your brothers, sisters, parents, children, friends.

Where are those people going to go when the private health insurer disappears?

How many hundreds of thousands of jobs (Democrat jobs) are going to be lost? What industry do you work in?

Is your job safe?

edit: Oh and let me ask you this, aren't you glad Barney Frank and Barack Obama are working so hard to eliminate those jobs?

They will probobly go work for the government health isurance departmen, who will most likely insure them as part of their employment package.
