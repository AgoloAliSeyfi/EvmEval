Tomorrow is the State of the Union and Obama will be talking about the huge deficit we have. Why didn't we ever hear about it during the Bush admin when during his admin the national debt was more than doubled? The deficits were huge!

But Bush hid them. He didn't put the two wars in the budget like Obama is doing. Remember all those emergency supplementals that congress voted on every few months? 250 billion here, 500 billion there, to fund the wars. We don't have those anymore, because the wars are funded, out in the open, by the budget.

But now, we see the deficit spending that these wars are causing, and suddenly everyone's all outraged.

This money has been draining our treasury for 8 years already.

The 2009 debt number is from the Bush administration's fiscal year. When they post the 2010 numbers, that will be Obama's.

So I was just wondering why the media is so stupid? They keep talking about the huge deficit in the Obama admin. But they never mentioned the doubling of the national debt under the Bush admin. Are they really so stupid that they didn't realize all those war supplementals weren't in the budget and therefore hidden away each year?

Wrong.

Obama signed into law over 9000 earmarks. A 7% increase.

Also...Bush never promised he would never sign any bills with Earmarks in it like Obama did.

So who broke their promise???

OVER 10,000 under Bush and his REPUBLICAN controlled Congress.

9000 in one bill.....The Stimulus bill.

Not arguing with you on the number, but I wanted to ask. Do you know how the administration got the list of projects included in the stimulus bill?
