BFS, Dickhead. I served 23 yrs in the USN and I came from an upper middle class family. While there is a percentage of the poor, most of the people I've met in the Military came from the Middle Class. negged for being stupid.

In times of piece, when the number of soldiers enlisted is lower, the army will only take the best and the brightest. During war, they go right after the poor. They were so deperate during the Iraq/Afganistan war that they took ex cons and sometimes even convicts in exchange for early release.

Since I was in during the war, please provide proof.

What have the poor done to deserve our support?

Don't talk to me. Talk to your "Jesus".

The only problem with your point is that you have not yet learned to distinguish between Charity and Forced Compliance. Learn to give voluntarily, from your Heart RD.

Now give me your wallet, with everything in it. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/> Give me a big smile and a hug too. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

There is no material difference to the poor person whether his handout came from a voluntary contribution or as you call it 'forced'. It has the same effect on him, and thus if you believe conservative propaganda, it makes him lazy and dependent.

BTW, since government social programs are democratically created, it is only a fraction of the people who pay for them who have any cause to call them 'forced'.

There is QUITE a difference in how it is obtained, WHICH IS THE FUCKING POINT... you advocate control, others advocate freedom.... Nobody is OWED the means for caring for themselves.. unless, that is, they are wards of the state

He said love your neighbor and take care of the sick and poor. That's what our government is doing.

Idiot...

Again... Jesus never called for the forced confiscation from others

</quote>

Actually Jesus' admonishment was to pay your taxes.

But by your own measure, it's forced confiscation that causes me to pay for the portion of defense spending that I don't support.

</quote>

Jesus's call to give was not tied to the confiscation by government... but nice try...

It is forced confiscation in taxes to pay for national defense.. which is for every person/citizen EQUALLY... not for the confiscation of some for the sole benefit of others...

Our government is not 'taking care of the sick and poor', they are throwing money at the problem... money that is being taken for forced charity

This is not some hippie commune where 'everyone is in this together'.. this is a nation based on freedoms and the protection of those freedoms.. among which is the freedom to succeed that goes hand in hand with the freedom to fail

While I whole heartedly call for people to support charities for causes that speak to them personally... in NO way should any charity or support be forced thru government and taxation... such things are exactly why we have the multi-tendrilled leviathan, hungry for power, that we have now... which is crippling our country

</quote>

Charity is limited in what they can do for the poor. They always have been. In good times, they are flush with funds and do not have as many people to help. In hard times, their funding dries up and they have more people asking for help.

The Government is always there for those in need. Not just with food and shelter but with healthcare, educational support, jobs programs......things that charity does not provide

</quote>

Charity is limited by donation....

You personally don't like it if someone else does not give as much as YOU think is enough for others to equalize outcome

The government's job is NOT to ensure your every personal need is taken care of... Government's job is to protect the freedoms of all citizens so that they can succeed or fail all on their own
