"Maybe it's a cultural difference but I do not see that "encouraging racism" extrapolates into "being racist"" Said Fox.

Lol! You're right. Apparently, - according to Lash, it extrapolates into being worse than racist:

"I think making excuses for racism is a dangerous form of racism. Possibly more dangerous than the lunkheads that come out and say the crap."

Let's not COMPLETELY re-write the facts about what Lash said, Fox.

She can say what she likes, within the TOS, but I and Nimh may, I think, reserve the right to be pretty disgusted by such comments.

I accept that this is the way you saw it Dlowan. I do not accept that as the way Lash meant it. Do you disagree that making excuses for racism is as bad or worse than racism itself? I don't believe she was personally directing that at you or Nimh. I think she was passionately expressing a conviction. I think we should all be allowed to do that.

Fox - I am flying out of here in an hour or so. And, frankly, I don't care what Lash thinks. I won't be staying and arguing anything, your words just caught my attention. I think there is nothing to be added to Nimh's and my arguments about the meagre "matter" of this thread - made many pages ago. I think Nimh has also made the definitive comments about Lash's insults. As far as I am concerned, there is nothing left to say here - and that is what I will be saying. I enjoy arguing, and sometimes pretty harshly, cos I am passionate, too, but there are places I think it silly to go.

You are also begging the actual question of whether Nimh and I WERE encouraging racism, you see. Did you realise that? You, having skipped the meat of the matter, now go on to ask the equivalent of the "have you stopped beating your wife" question.

I have not actually argued, here, that Lash ought not to be allowed to do what she did. I consider that kind of arguing distasteful, and I DO think it was clearly a personal attack - but such is life.

Okay Dlowan. You know I love you and Nimh and appreciate you both. I think all of us, even me though I'm damn near perfect of course, are capable of phrasing things that have a completely unintentional affect on others. Probably that's even why I piss so many people off here. I really don't mean to. I want to be loved as much as the next person. And I'll no doubt keep right on doing it.
