Look here is the thing........You have THREE options for health care. Get it through your employer. Get it by buying it YOURSELF from an ins company(not possible for most people since it cost's over $1,000 dollars(more than a house payment for many) or go without and hope like HELL you or a family member NEVER gets sick. Now here's the REALLY bad thing. Let's say you get REALLY sick and lose your job because you can't work......Guess what.......Your ins is GONE when you need it MOST. I guess you could get COBRA for a few months but there is NO WAY you could afford it cause hey you are OUT OF A JOB!

I've had my own insurance for over a year and half. You really should stop spreading lies, like it will cost over $1,000. It costs no where near that. I pay under $500 per month for a family plan with Dental insurance. (from Blue Cross)

Really, people we need to stop lying about the current state of affairs. Anyone with a decent paying job can afford health insurance privately purchased. I just went to eheathinsurance.com. If you don't believe me, go there and see what a plan would cost for you. I have no affiliation, just proving a point.

You apparently are very young with no problems. At the last company where I worked, one of the guys went out of our company plan, in which he was paying over $1,000 a month for family coverage, for a cheaper plan he obtained through the internet.

Everything was fine until he came down with multiple sclerosis--no previous history or family history, but they soon cancelled his coverage. They had no intention of taking care of someone who had so many medical needs.

Sure, buy internet insurance or any of those other plans--just don't get sick!

Wrong again! Do you ever tire of being wrong?

I'm well over 40. As I noted in my previous post, not particularly sickly. We do have pre-existing conditions in my family that is covered. That caused the price to be more expensive than it would otherwise.

So, you are saying that because I bought insurance through the mechanism of the Internet, that Blue Cross and Blue Shield purchased through that mechanism is different than Blue Cross purchased another way?

Wrong again. I had the policy reviewed by my mother, who owned an insurance brokerage for 30 years and she pronounced it a good policy. But, I'm sure your take on it is far superior, right?

I'm not wrong. But I don't expect the son of an insurance broker to acknowledge that the insurance companies have been fleecing the citizens of the US for decades. So your mother got you a good price? Most people aren't that fortunate.

I know you can get LIFE ins anywhere over state lines but I question getting HEALTH ins that way.

Say I was ABLE to get a Health Ins plan from Washington state.....I would be outta network where ever I go in Idaho. I think we have basically TWO choices Blue Shield and the other I can't remember but TWO choices isn't very much competition don't you think?
