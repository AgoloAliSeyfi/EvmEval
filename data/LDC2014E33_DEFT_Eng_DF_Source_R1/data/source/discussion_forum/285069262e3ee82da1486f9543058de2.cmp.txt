<img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> You're quoting a left wing propaganda site as a legitimate source? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

7% shareholder..... and you're seriously gonna continue to pretend he 'runs' FNC? Even an idiot can see the numbers don't add up.

I despise willful stupidity. Pathetic spinning and whining instead of using basic logic... you're making yourself look ridiculous.

</quote>

Even a hyper-partisan dunce like yourself should realize that although normally 7 is a low number in percentage, in ownership of companies such as FOXNEWS it reflects a large percentage of influence.

From your own quote earlier, he's the second largest shareholder.

Snap out of your partisan stupor and smell the roses.

</quote>

He got FOX to scrub any references to Saudi cash backing Al Qaeda. Heck..even Bush scrubbed the Saudis from the 9/11 commission report.

Saudis are the puppet masters of American conservatives.

</quote>

No, only a bit too much influence with Bush II. The US has ignored Saudi human abuses for decades; OIL is the reason.

And, the influence that it shows happened is that the Saudi's request to change the description of a protest as a Muslim one to a civil one was only done after it was confirmed that it was not just Muslim.

Oh, the horror of such influence.

Which is pretty much the same as any other influential group trying to influence media... say, like the Color of Change organizing email campaigns to sponsors of right wing talk show hosts.

Influence... people have it, people use it. I see nothing of import in that. Of course, I'm not an hysterical lying race baiter.

Right. Rarely are retractions made without someone telling the organization that they are wrong.

Such influence! The horror! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

They must be state run, too.

NBC is owned by GE. GE is American. Thus NBC is state run. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

Are they not a media company interesting in keeping the populate updated on the latest and greatest and hottest news?

Any of you wager to guess why such little coverage for the biggest, most powerful media organization on the world?

You should just give up expecting honesty or rational thought from swallow. He's lost the last remaining thread linking him to reality long ago.

Naw..the Saudis have been financing terrorism against the US for ages. The reason? They wanted the US to go after their enemies..like Iraq.
