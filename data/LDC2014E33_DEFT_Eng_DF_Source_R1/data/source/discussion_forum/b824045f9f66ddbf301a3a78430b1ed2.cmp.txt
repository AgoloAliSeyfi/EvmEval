I'm the trailing spouse. Mostly because dh has a higher earning potential than I do, and my field of work (freelancing) can be done from home mostly over the internet/phone as long as I build/maintain a base clientele.

I trail him. We made that decision very early on, when we were only engaged, and close to equals in the workforce. DH was presented an opportunity which would allow exponential career growth that we couldn't refuse. As a result of that and us immediately getting pregnant my career took a backseat.
I have been fortunate in that we work for the same company so there will always be potential for me to find a job wherever we move. Right now I'm working remotely as a result of our last move.
Sometimes it bothers me. I've been working almost 10 years and still at the same job with no opportunity for growth unless I move on. But I stay here because it's what is best for the family. I have only a 40 hour per week commitment and the flexibility of working at home. DH works long hours so I run the house in addition to working full time. DH has said he's 100% supportive if I want to find a new job and start building our career again but I feel it would be stupid to give up what I have now.
In the end DH's career moves have more than paid off and allowed us a lot of financial freedom so I can't be too upset about it. He has even bigger aspirations for the future.

My husband has to go where there is a teaching position in his area of expertise. I have a job that exists everywhere.

I trailed, for both residency and fellowship.
His specialty has only a couple hundred practicing physicians in it, mine has several thousand. Thus good residency positions and good attending jobs are much more abundant for me in a greater variety of places. DH is limited to bigger cities and larger hospitals.

My husband is the trailing spouse. He has a much more flexible career and my earnings will always far exceed his.
It was difficult at first to come to the decision especially because family on both sides have a hard time with what they see as gender role reversal but it suits us both now.
However we made the decision that was right for us as a family. If he had not followed me our combined income would have been several times less than I make now.

I'm trailing since 2009, and I've been pretty outspoken on this board about how I don't like it.
My DH makes 10x what I make. I applied for over 660 jobs in 18 months when we came to this location. I didn't need to work but wanted to.

So I started my own business---when your ship doesn't come in, swim out to it.

I have been the trailing spouse but interestingly enough my trailing him to live abroad for his job ended up being the catalyst for landing me an awesome job earning twice what I made at the job I resigned from for our move!
Now it would be a LOT harder for me to follow him just where ever, because my career is taking off.
I'm not keen on giving up my career to be a SAHM, and DH isn't keen on giving up my salary either. So now I suppose both our jobs are given equal consideration. Though he makes nearly 50% more, my salary is still too substancial to throw away.

My DH graduated first, so in this economy, he went where the work was and I followed. It worked for us, but it would have been challenging deciding whether to "trail" or not if I already had a job I loved.
