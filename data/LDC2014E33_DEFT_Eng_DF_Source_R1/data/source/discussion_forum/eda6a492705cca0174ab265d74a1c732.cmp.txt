Half of Unemployment Rate Decline Due to People Giving Up Job Search, Labor Data Show
December 2, 2011  Half of the 0.4 percent decline in the nations unemployment rate is due to people giving up hope of finding a job and leaving the labor force altogether in November, government data and CNSNews.com calculations show.

In the month of November, 315,000 people left the labor force altogether, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported on Friday. The unemployment rate, reported today, has declined by 0.4 percent  from 9.0 in October to 8.6 percent in November. However, had those 315,000 people not left the labor force, the unemployment rate would have been 8.8 percent  0.2 percent higher than the officially-reported 8.6 percent rate for November.

The unemployment rate went down for two reasons: the economy created 120,000 jobs and 315,000 people left the labor force in November. If those who had left the labor force are added back into it and added to the ranks of the unemployed  because they do not have jobs  the small decline in the unemployment rate is cut in half  to 0.2 percent. In October, the size of the labor force was 154 million people and 13.9 million were unemployed. In November, the labor force was 153.9 million people and 13.3 million were unemployed.

Other BLS data show the true jobless nature of the current economy. Despite the 120,000 jobs added in November, the overall population grew by 172,000, meaning that there are not enough jobs being created to keep up with population growth. Those 172,000 people went right into the ranks of those who are not in the labor force at all, a figure which rose to 86.6 million in November, up 487,000 during the month. Secondly, the number of those who want a job now, according to the BLS, rose 192,000 in November, going from 6.4 to 6.55 million people in November.

So we've heard 2 years worth of Obama whining like his OWS peasants, Him mostly whining about a "do nothing Congress" and the "GOP obstruction" stopping him from doing anything.

Now unemployment is down to 8.6%. And libtards are dropping to their knees to PRAISE HIM!!!!

Why? CEO's approved this hiring. Corporations funded it. Barack Hussein Obama has been hampered by a "do nothing Congress" and "GOP obstructionists"......right?

So when shit goes bad, Obama is immune from blame, because a do-nothing Congress and the GOP are preventing Him from dong anything.

But when things go well, He gets immediate credit, despite the fact that all that new hiring is being done by the very CEO's and corporations He and his ilk spew verbal venom at every chance they get.

Thanks to all the CEO's and corporations for taking the chance to go ahead and hire. We know, with Obama in office the future is very unknown and shaky, but you guys hired anyway. Keep up the good work. And Mr. President...try not to fuck it up. Of course, you cant't do much with a do-nothing Congress, so not sure why you got credit for it anyway.

"I'm saying it bluntly, that this administration is the greatest wet blanket to business, progress and job creation in my lifetime. A lot of people don't want to say that. They'll say, 'Oh God, don't be attacking Obama.' Well, this is Obama's deal, and it's Obama that's responsible for this fear in America."

"The guy [Obama] keeps making speeches about redistribution, and maybe 'we ought to do something to businesses that don't invest or hold too much money.' We haven't heard that kind of talk except from pure socialists."

"Business is being hammered. The business community in this country is frightened to death of the weird political philosophy of the president of the United States. Until he's gone, everybody's going to be sitting on their thumbs."

I can't blame a corporation for not hiring.

Of course progressives believe its a companies job to hire because money grows on trees...

If I was a CEO i'd piss out my office window... hahahaha
