Oakland Names Independent Investigator Into Use Of Police Force With Occupiers

Oakland leaders tapped a former Baltimore police commissioner Wednesday to head the investigation into the Police Department's handling of the Occupy protests.

Thomas Frazier, who was Baltimore's top cop from 1994 to 1999 and before that a deputy chief in San Jose, said he hoped to issue his first report within 90 days.
Oakland will spend up to $100,000 for the initial report, which will cover only the police response during the protests stemming from the first police eviction of the Occupy encampment Oct. 25.

The city, which plans to contract with Frazier to also look into police handling of the general strike protests in November, decided to separate the investigations because they involved different circumstances and different mutual aid partners, City Administrator Deanna Santana said. All of the reports will be made public and presented to the City Council.[/quote]

A new Occupy Oakland encampment sprang up in West Oakland on Tuesday and already there are more than a dozen tents.

The new camp is located in a vacant lot on the 2000 block of Peralta Street near Mandela Parkway and is being called the Cypress Triangle, according to the Occupy California website.

New Occupy Camp Comes Down

<quote>
Police on Wednesday cleared more than a dozen tents from a nascent Occupy Oakland encampment in West Oakland, citing and releasing 20 people and arresting at least one person.
</quote>

<quote>
The lot is owned, at least in part, by Brian Collins, senior vice president of Cassidy Turley Commercial Real Estate Services in Oakland. Collins said Wednesday that having campers on the land "presents a tremendous amount of liability for us."
Occupiers, though, disputed that they were camping on a parcel owned by Collins or anyone else. They said they researched the land and set up camp on a section of the lot, which is split into several parcels, upon which no taxes are being paid and that has no legal owner. Officials, however, disputed that.

Occupy Oakland Shut Out Of City Hall

<quote>
Oakland City Hall was shut down Thursday afternoon, after two dozen Occupy Oakland protesters tried to storm the building.

Members of Occupy Oakland’s interfaith coalition called for protesters to take over the mayor’s and city administrator’s offices Thursday after police arrested 12 protesters in Frank Ogawa Plaza on Wednesday night.

The protesters arrested Wednesday were violating the terms of a permit, according to city officials.

Police Chief Howard Jordan revoked the permit Monday because Occupiers were sleeping in and around the teepee, cooking and serving food there and using the area for storage.

In response to the police action, activists gathered at Frank Ogawa Plaza on Thursday afternoon before splitting up and trying to enter city hall through the side doors on opposite sides of the building, CBS reports.

They banged on the doors on the 14th Street side, and demanded to be let in. A man came to the door and told the protesters that someone would come out and talk to them, but that they had to “calm down.”

The protesters then tried to push their way through the doors but were blocked and the doors locked again.

The excuse given for shutting out the protesters came from police Sgt. Serge Babka, who said, "We cannot accommodate a large group, so we had to close the doors."

The timeline of events here is very important. Certain media outlets are using phrasing that Occupiers "stormed" city hall, but independent journalist Susie Cagle reports that it was only after the doors were locked that the protest turned angry.

"Doors locked, then OPD opened &amp; ppl told not allowed, then chants &amp; anger," Cagle tweeted.

Finally, around 2:30 p.m., officers allowed four members of the Interfaith Council to enter the building and talk to city staffers.

Oakland Police Name-Covering Episode Prompts Suspension, Demotion

<quote>
An Oakland police officer has been suspended and his supervisor demoted after the officer covered up his name badge with black tape during a November 2nd Occupy Oakland protest.

Officer John Hargraves was hit with a 30-day suspension. His supervisor, Lt. Clifford Wong, was demoted for failing to properly report the incident that was caught on a video that was posted online.

In the video, a man can be heard posing a question to one of the officers, asking whether or not it’s against policy for officers to hide their name badges.

Attorney Jim Channon has asked a federal judge to slap additional sanctions on the officers, saying obscuring the name badge not only violates state law, but various reforms agreed to after the notorious “Riders” case.

In the days leading up to the Nov. 2 march on the Port of Oakland, city leaders warned about the drain on police resources.

When Jordan (Oakland Police Chief - Howard Jordan) received an update that crime was actually down 19 percent in the last week of October, he wrote an email to one of Mayor Jean Quan's advisers.

"Not sure how you want to share this good news," he wrote. "It may be counter to our statement that the Occupy movement is negatively impacting crime in Oakland."
