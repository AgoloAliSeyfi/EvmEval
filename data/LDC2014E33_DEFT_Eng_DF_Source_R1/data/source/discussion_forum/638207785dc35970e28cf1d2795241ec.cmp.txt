Thailand is a popular tourism destination and hailed as 'the land of smiles'. It is a democracy with regular changes in government many of them due to coup.

It is now undergoing political turmoil with tens of thousands out on the street. At the same time, an Asian Summit is being held in a tourist resort.

Apr 9, 2009 [ForeignPolicy] Bangkok's streets are again filled with protesters this week in what will likely prove a boisterous but futile attempt to force the government's resignation. But behind all the noise, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who has been directing these demonstrations from outside the country, may well have a more subtle, longer-term agenda.

Thaksin and his supporters have been attacking the country's "aristocracy"--and top adviser to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Prem Tinsulanonda, in particular. This suggests that Thaksin's maneuvers are related less to any effort to immediately oust the current government but instead to undermining the power structures centered around the monarchy, particularly the King's privy council, and the succession process that Thailand will face once ailing King Bhumibol passes from the scene.

The protests are generating more noise than usual thanks to warnings from Thaksin that "the time for talks has passed" and the sense that protesters (known as "red shirts") are pushing for a confrontation. The former prime minister, ousted in a 2006 coup, is still able to create tension in the capital by rallying his supporters from Thailand's northeast and among Bangkok's poor.

But without support from the military, the monarchy, and Bangkok's middle class, these protests are highly unlikely to divide the country's political elite and threaten the current regime. Even Thaksin's allies know that even if they could force new elections, the elite-controlled institutions could undermine their administration. Thaksin is believed to be in either Dubai or Cambodia, and evidence suggests that the military is trying to block his satellite telephone calls to followers inside Thailand....

In short, Thailand is in the midst of a power struggle that could reach deeply into its institutions and power structures. It started with a fight between the elites and Thaksin in 2006, and has begun to spill over into the public sphere. The stakes have been magnified by the uncertainty around the royal succession in a country in which the monarchy remains the most powerful political institution. Thailand's history shows that this type of conflict will take time to resolve, with results ranging from the absurd to the tragic.

Here is a good point by point Q&amp;A analysis of these unrests in Thailand.

Apr 10, 2009 BANGKOK (Reuters) - Political unrest has returned to Thailand with supporters of ousted premier Thaksin Shinawatra bringing the capital to a grinding halt.... The "red shirt" Thaksin supporters are demanding the current government step down so new elections can be held and have taken their protests to the southern beach town which is holding an Asia summit this weekend.

WHO'S FIGHTING WHO?

It's Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva versus Thaksin, who was removed by the army in a bloodless coup in September 2006 and now lives in self-imposed exile.

The protests are funded and guided from a distance by Thaksin, a former police officer who built up a telecoms empire before turning to politics and becoming prime minister in 2001....

Thaksin funnelled government funds to the poor in the countryside and cities, winning their devotion. But he was also widely seen as authoritarian and critics accused him of corruption. Above all, he was accused of republican leanings in a country that reveres King Bhumibol Adulyadej.

All this set him up for a fight with the royalist elite, the military and the 'old money' business community, and he was ousted in a military coup in September 2006.

Abhisit -- educated at Eton and Oxford and a smooth performer on the international stage -- is much closer to that elite.

He became prime minister in December, taking over from a pro-Thaksin premier,...

WHAT'S THE CHANCE OF THE PROTESTS SPREADING?

Apart from an effort to disrupt a high-profile Asian summit in the seaside town of Pattaya, there has been little echo of the protests outside Bangkok, as Thaksin's allies concentrated their resources on bussing supporters to the capital....

COULD THE PROTESTS TURN VIOLENT?

Abhisit is adamant the government will not crack down, but security forces will take action if the protests turn violent.

Economics Professor Lae Dilokvidhyarat from Chulalongkorn University says Abhisit has learnt a lesson from history.

"History since the 1970s has showed that every civil strife or coup in this country was triggered or stemmed from the government, police or soldiers starting a crackdown," he said.

WILL ALL THIS HURT THE ECONOMY?

The economy is already on the ropes, likely to shrink as much as 4 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund, because of a slump in exports and the effects of last year's unrest, which hit tourism badly....
