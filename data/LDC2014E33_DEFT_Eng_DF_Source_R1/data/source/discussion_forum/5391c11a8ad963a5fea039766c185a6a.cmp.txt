The ows are just a bunch of spoiled kids that want great pay w/o the education or effort it takes to get it.

None of them are taking personal responsibility, just blaming Wall St.

I'd be embarrassed to have anyone in my family involved in this non-sense.

Obviously you're totally ignorant as to the make up of the people participating in the protests. They are senior citizens who got screwed out of their retirement...they are college grads who GOT the grades and are now looking at debt w ith NO job prospects....they are parents, spouses, long time employees who saw their jobs outsourced overseas....and ALL of them have watched Wall St. and it's banking buddies in management making out like bandits, and then bitch that they may have to give up some tax breaks and loopholes.

If I were YOU, I'd be embarassed to voice your ignorance in public.

Utter fucking nonsense.

If you're referring to the Limbaugh-esque BS you're about to regurgitate, then I whole heartedly agree.
I just went from one job to another. It took me a whole month to find it.

Good for you....where do you live? where you fired? down sized? Left for better pay?what's the unemployment rate in your area? what's your field of expertise? What was the job? In the same field as the old one? Are you saying that because YOU got a job that everyone else that doesn't have one isn't trying?

There's jobs, it's just that those whiny bitches won't take anything they can find.

Spoken like a true willfully ignorant neocon/teabagger parrot....you got yours, so everyone else is just a slacker looking for a handout. Obviously, the reports of major downsizings by various corporations and industries, the official reports spotlighted by Congress and the Senate showing how companies are NOT opening their doors to higher people, and the 9% unemployment rate verified by the unemployment insurance rates reported by ALL press regardless of political affiliation is lost on your closed mind.

Your lack of information and vast wealth of propaganda, must make it hard to carry on an honest conversation.

An apt projection of yourself, bunky.

No, you're not nuts...just a pathetic liar and BS artist. Bottom line: my story stands based on FACTS easily verified in the current news. All YOU'VE got is some personal claim and some ass backwards assessments as to what's going on in the REAL world. Carry on.

Sure they are. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Stop getting your info from Fox.

You guys talk about class warfare, I think the right is more involved in class warfare than anyone else. The problem is, you are going after people just like you.

Dont be dim.

I listen to what they say on camera, on msnbc, abc and fox.

They are all a bunch of spoiled kids, or whiny adults that want other people to take care of them.

No genius, THEY WANT MORE JOBS TO BE AVAILABLE....THEY WANT THE RAT BASTARDS ON WALL ST. AND THEIR BANKING BUDDIES TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE CRIMES AGAINST SOCIETY (THEFT), AND THEY WANT TO STOP BEING USED BY THE WEALTHY TO PAY FOR THEIR LARGESSE AND ERRORS I.E., UNION BUSTING, LOPSIDED TAX BREAKS AND LOOPHOLES.

I got that from listening to MSNBC, ABC, NPR, WBAI.....seems YOU need to get your head out of Limbaugh's fat ass, clean out your ears, and EXPAND YOUR COGNITIVE REASONING AND LISTENING SKILLS.

I forgot how willfully ignorant and purposely obtuse you can be, Cali-Girl. Let me dumb it down for you: Murdoch was born into the American equivalent of upper middle-class....the next best thing to being "old money". So he had ADVANTAGES from birth...he did NOT have to work his way up the ladder or beat his brains to get a scholarship. So the comparison to Sharpton as a "self made man" is a crock. Got that, bunky?

Actually, LackyTiberal, I was wonder when Australia became part of the UK.

Actually, you're just another dumb bunny neocon/teabagger who doesn't have the guts to admit you're wrong as you continually pull stuff out of your ass and try to pass it off as "facts". The chronology of the posts shows I readily conceded my geographical error....which DOES NOT disprove the FACTS regarding my opening or subsequent posts.

Grow the fuck up, Cali-Girl and stop making an ass of yourself...even I am beginning to feel embarassed for you.
