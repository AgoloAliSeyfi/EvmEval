I can understand why some aid was turned down. All of it due to political reasons. Whether that's right or wrong history will judge.

Hardly. Read through that last link ( <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/files/Katrina%20Matrix.pdf">http://www.citizensforethics.org/fil...a%20Matrix.pdf</a> )

(for example) what was the "political reason" for rejecting the Australian's offer of "search and rescue team, emergency managers, disaster rescue and logistics specialists, emergency
assessment team, 3 fire rescue team members and forensic assistants" ?

Did you ever stop to think that we may have already had enough of the rejected items on hand already...and did you ever stop to think about the logistical efforts needed to bring even MORE stuff we already have into the effected area?

Or refusing Austria's "disaster relief team specializing in water purification and decontamination, 10 disaster relief experts, 10 water pumps, 4 person psychological support team, 6 person communication support team, elite police "Cobra" team specializing in protection, 100 troops with technical skills"?

But hey. We did accept their 500 tarps and 300 camp beds =\

1. There will NEVER be foreign troops based on American soil..NEVER. Let's get that straightened out.
2. Many of the items you mention may have already been on hand. While I'm sure the gesture was appreciated why would we want 100 different water pumps from 100 different countries sitting around rusting or not being able to be used because of electrical system differences.

Good. I'm not trying to change the way you think about the response to Katrina but realize that there are underlying circumstances as to why some aid is accepted and some is rejected. If it is rejected you just can't out and out blame the government for ineptitude when you don't know the underlying circumstances.

This is why I don't understand it when the Democrats claim to be critical thinkers. They only use critical thinking when looking to disparage, demean and denigrate their opposition and their policies.

I understand the gesture in us helping Haiti. Even as a Ron Paul supporter I support helping another country with humanitarian aid in a time like this...but using the RESERVES??

That's not a job of the reserve component. Those men and women are supposed to be the last line of defense here on our shores, and to augment the active duty forces during a time of war or national emergency. National emergency meaning, US national emergency.

This is a misuse of the reserves if you ask me. As if it wasn't bad enough that Bush pretty much back door drafted most of them into Iraq, now Obama is bringing them into Haiti in a clear misuse of their purpose.

I'm already certain the comments on this are going to be pretty evenly divided down partisan lines, too.

Whose is he going to send SEIU and ACORN?
The domestic security force with the same funding and power as the military?

From the Washington Post:

<quote>
Signed on Saturday and released by the White House on Sunday, the executive order permits the Defense Department and Homeland Security Department to tap reserve medical personnel and a Coast Guard unit that will help provide port security.

</quote>

I don't have a problem with this.

It is in our best interests to stabilize the situation in Haiti. Not just from a humanitarian standpoint, either. Whatever we can do to limit the throngs that are going to start rafting across the Atlantic to our shores is effort well spent.
