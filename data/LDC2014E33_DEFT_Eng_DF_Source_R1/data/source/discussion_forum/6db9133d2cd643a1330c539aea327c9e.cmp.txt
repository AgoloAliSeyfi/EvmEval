I still haven't heard any suggestions for a better system.

Unfortunately the corruption in government is so deeply imbedded it will take a revolution to rip it out. But the new rulers are tactful enough at their game to maintain sufficient balance in wealth and privilege distribution within the lower class that the spark of revolution remains too cool to start the necesary fire. There is at least one Tory for every four or five prospective revolutionaries. And a lot of those Tories participate right here in this forum.

Also, the Indefinite Detention bill presently being floored will, if passed, effectively eliminate Due Process and Habeas Corpus. And while Obama had promised to veto the bill he recently withdrew that promise. (I am now totally disgusted with that phony sonofabitch.)

The bill will enable the military to detain for an indefinite period, without formal charges or an arraignment hearing, anyone suspected of "terrorism," whatever that means. Based on what we've already seen it's not hard to foresee it being applied to something like publicly saying, "I'm fed up with this goddam government and I think we need to do something to change it!"

"Terrorism."

Well, we can certainly guess what is not considered "terrorism" by this administration:

Pols get to walk all the time.

krist just look at the record of anyone in Congress.

I'd bet at least 75 percent should be in jail.

As wrong as this is, please recall, Kennedy killed a woman and obama executed a citizen w/o a trial.

And no one said or will say shit about it.

Regarding the comment: "Rape the Rich" from the mindless left.

Let me see if I understand your point of view. Wealth and power are in fact concentrated to a decreasing number of people;

</quote>

Not really.

The the population in the top 1%, 5% and 10% of income earners has stayed pretty static relative to total population since 1990.

Yes, I oppose corruption. I have no issue with wealth. The more wealth created, the better. I support wealth and oppose corruption.

I'm the opposite of the democrats, I suppose, who oppose wealth and favor corruption.

<quote>
HOWEVER, you find it inanely absurd (to the point that it is mindless) to think that the same wealth/power is not used to manipulate the law making process, tax code, or financial institutions. Is that accurate?

</quote>

Again, the issue is one of corruption. Equal justice under the law is the foundation of this nation. We have lost that, we have distinctly different laws for the well connected than we do for the common people.

Wealth and power often go hand in hand, in the case of the Clintons, the wealth is a by-product of political power. It is the connections that pervert the law though, not the wealth.

Simply put, I believe that Barack Obama should be held to the same law that Tyrone Jackson in San Bernardino is - and I don't think you can argue that he is.

</quote>

I take offense when you call people mindless who would take your very logic, and say "Has all wealth and power in this country been earned by the people who wield it." The answer is no. People love the Bill Gates of this country and have no problem with them. Coincidentally, most wealthy people who earn their wealth (like him) claim that they don't carry the public burden on a fair level. The point of those "mindless" people you accuse, is that much of that wealth and power has been accumulated through corruption and exploitation. Two concepts that led our country to rebel in the first place (see taxation without representation). The same thing is happening now on a more convoluted level with lobbyists (powerful) writing our laws and tax code.

Your logic is somewhat confusing to me is all I'm saying. I don't think Americans HATE rich. They just don't like being lied to, cheated, deceived, and exploited. In the very same way that takes place in our justice system.

</quote>

Who wouldn't want to be rich beyond their wildest dreams? The conservative misconception is that liberals hate money. It's not the money liberals hate.... it's the devious means in which some of the rich people obtain their wealth.

they also understood that equal opportunity was paramount, and, equal outcome would not and should not ever be assured.

you can do a lot with numbers as presented the way you did. You are assuming that becasue there is more people in jail now, than there was 40 years ago it is due to some mass scale of injustice.

can you relate to me how that is, exactly?

when a person makes an issue of the earning power and riches of another, absent particular crimes used to amass such, in a society that is upwardly mobile that provides the same playing field for all, what is it then?

Who is stopping others from becoming the beneficiary of same?

</quote>

Do you know the great thing about numbers. They don't lie. However, it's the interpretation of the numbers that matters. If crime had gone up by 1,250% in 40 years, that could account for the higher prison numbers. And if the population of the US had risen by the same percentage, that would also explain the increase in the number of people in prision. Neithe of those things is true. And no combination of a higher population and an increase of the crime rate can account for those numbers. So, it's something else, isn't it?

Perhaps you would care to offer an alternate theory.

</quote>

That's easy - the asinine war on drugs. A HUGE section of that prison populous was put there on drug charges. A crime that is essentially hurting no one but yourself.
