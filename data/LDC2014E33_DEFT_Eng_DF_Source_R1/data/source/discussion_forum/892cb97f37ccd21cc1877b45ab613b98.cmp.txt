Your last post in particular is a complete mess of false logic and nonsense. You couldn't get the attacks out quick enough and in the process completely lost any train of coherent thought.

Do you feel better for getting that lot of your chest? I suppose it's best to let it flow unrestricted and then spend time sorting it all into some sense later.

Let me know when you've done that.

Tim- do you agree that someone who is not anti-Semitic would not post anti-Semitic articles on their website?

The same thing that it had to do with the thread in which you originally brought it up.

What's ADL got to do with any of the many threads where you have brought it up, to make up lies?

Why do you spam threads in the 9/11 subforum with whiny rants about "dewunkers" then run away from the thread never to be seen again? What does your whining have to do with the topics of those threads?

How does it feel to be a hypocrite, and to lack critical reasoning skills?

Hypocrisy aside, your fake agnosticism is spot on topic. I pointed it out because you have said that Alex Jones capaigns against people who killed thousands. I know of few people who have killed thousands. The 19 terrorists of 9/11 are a good example.

You should talk about the lie where Alex Jones posted on his site an article that stated arrogance was a Jewish trait. That was a lie; I totally made it up. Alex jones posted no such article because he would never allow such a thing on his site, he likes Jews so much.

It's good that you don't consider Jones a hero. Oh wait, another lie, from proven liar Tin Foil Timothy who makes up lies about KSM due to lack of intelligence and knowledge. If he wasn't your hero you wouldn't show up in every single thread involving Jones to defend his indefensible actions and suggest pure stupid ideas that not even Jones himself is dumb enough to do, like suing an Internet forum.

Why don't you prove that you don't like Jones, by stating where you disagree with him. Oh wait I forgot you're an "agnostic" so that means you only attack debunkers. LOL.

And it's laughable to suggest Jones is my hero. I think he's an idiot. I guess this was posted by somebody else then:

Maybe someone else logged into your account. lol. Your should get your password changed.

Say if the kid called AJ on his radio show and Alex told the kid that for the sake of the TM, that sacrificing the kid's life would be beneficial. Ten minutes later, there is breaking news about a kid who goated police killing him after the kid killed three police officers.

Would AJ be culpable of blame in this case?

There is legal precedent for having him charged.</a>

LOUISVILLE, Ky., Aug. 11 (UPI) -- A man in Kentucky has been charged with murder in the death of his wife after giving the drunken woman a loaded gun she used to kill herself, officials said.

Katherine Mae Simpson killed herself last September during a heated argument with her husband James Simpson, the Louisville (Ky.) Courier-Journal reported Monday.

The invisible squabbles of zealots aside, I'd disagree that the thread title is hyperbole. This is precisely the sort of pattern that history's nastiest characters follow: infect the youth of the nation with woo, direct their small-minded vitriol towards the people they want dead, and let them loose. When that happens, a pile of dead teenagers on the evening news is the best -case scenario. There's more than one reason I call these poor kids "Blackshirts."
