There was one stupid review on amazon which says it was written by a Labour supporter....hardly, I'm pretty sure Tim Bale is a true blue Tory!

I didn't feel there was any bias in there. There are some hard criticisms of things that went on in the Tory party during the Hague and IDS eras, but a lot of the criticisms come from Tories themselves, there are a lot of people in the book who don't pull any punches about the crap that went on. The era that the book covers is the worst era in Tory party history so there is bound to be a lot of criticism in there but he is not slagging off the Conservative party.

But that's what I liked about the book, its not just a boring academic book giving a dry analysis of the time, it gets down and dirty and people say what they thought, and you can see the party has learned from its mistakes of the past, all the infighting over Europe just let Blair dominate British politics without a credible opposition. I know after the panning of 1997 it would have been a big ask to win office back in one go but you can see in the book the sense of frustration some Tories had that they thought the party basically wasted 6 years between 1997 and 2003 and it wasn't until Michael Howard took over that they started making credible steps towards being a strong opposition.

IDS gets rinsed in there from some of the anonymous Tory contributors....I can't remember the exact quotes but there were some in there from ex Cabinet ministers saying things like "he's not that bright a bloke, you couldn't give him a ministerial job he wouldn't be up to it".

I think the history of the Tory party is very interesting especially this period, have you seen the "Lady's Not For Spurning" documentary presented by Portillo, which is on youtube.

Good stuff.

Have you noticed how there are bugger all books about the Conservative party? In our uni library there were stacks of books about the Labour party in various eras but hardly any about the Tories. There are billions about Blair and Brown.

Some of the autobiographies are good though, I've got Major's, Thatchers, Hestletine's, Lawson's and Howe's. It's good reading the same events in all their books...you hear a different perspective each time. Major's book is the best of them I reckon, for someone who had the media image of being boring he writes well.

Yes our college library had about four books on the Conservatives and about four hundred on the Labour Party. For the so called "oldest political party" you would think there would be a few more books.

I am not a fan of autobiographies because they contain so much information I don't care about.
