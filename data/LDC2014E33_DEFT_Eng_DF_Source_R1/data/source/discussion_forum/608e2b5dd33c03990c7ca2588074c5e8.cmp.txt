I don't know how to go about seeking vengence on BP for desecration of the Gulf. I am beside myself. My best friend #3 was going to St. George Island with her family for Mother's Day this weekend. But they will probably cancel because the oil slick will have reached those sugary sand beaches by then.

About a month after the ocean's shores have been befouled, the inland waterways will begin showing the devasation. The Wakulla River, where my kidlet taught me to canoe. The St. John's River, where we hung out in a biker bar in St. Mark's on Fridays after work, eating broiled shrimp and drinking cheap beer, just watching the Earth do it's thing.

Eventually the oil will travel the underground and above-ground aquifer to every Florida body of water, including the beleagered Everglades...a natural phenomena unparrelled on Planet Earth and precious not only to Florida, but to the entire Planet for the role it plays in our wildlife, ecosystem and so on.

Death would not be too severe a punishment for BP's CEO, as I see it.

Don't buy BP gasoline!

Try to boycott, especially if you are purchasing large quantities for a commercial trucking, farming or airline business.

I welcome any additional ideas on how to afflict BP.

I am just heart broken. I cannot tell you what this preventable insult to the Earth will be like for all of Florida, and beyond.

Great...we have our very own eco-terrorist.

and guess what boycotting BP gets you? That's right...taxpayers end up footing the bill for the clean-up. Smooth move Ex-Lax.

Well, I'm not really sure a boycott qualifies as "terrorism"...

And didn't you say that the taxpayers were going to have to foot the bill anyway?

boycott....no...calling for the death of the CEO.... YES! The taxpayers are already footing a portion of the bill!!!!! It's called the US Coast Guard and the US Navy being on scene and providing support...do you want them to do the entire clean up now?

*Note to self: Call Mom and thank her for teaching me the ability to think for myself.*

BP's Oil, Transoceans platform, US Governments consent, the states bent over backwards to help BP, each and every American uses the products of the oil industry and refuse to cut their consumption.

Fuck you. We are all responsible, including those who are probably going to lose their livelihoods. Idiot.

Culpability may lie elsewhere, you baggy cunt. But it is gonna to lie FIRST on BP's executives.

I'm not surprised you need to call your Mommy. Tell her someone is being mean to you, and remember, you nasty case of cunt-grease, that Sunday is Mother's Day.

Mebbe she can teach you some fucking manners too, on a remedial ed program.

Some issues are more important than your narcissistic, neurotic need to attempt to goad me, you snail slime trail-blazer, California Girl.

You are a fine one to lecture on manners, you fucking freak.

I prefer to judge on facts, not hysterical whining and the bullshit in the media. It's not my fault you're stupid so name-calling won't change the fact. You're a ranting idiot and I am not. Live with it.

However, your posts do disprove one old wife's tale "With age comes wisdom".... clearly not.

Join this topic of conversation of go fuck yourself, CaliforniaGirl. No one asked you to opine on my freaking manners...the Op is "Boycott BP", not attempt to pee in my Wheaties.

I think you need more help than a call to Mommy is likely to raise, you infected pus-filled cunt.

Go seep elsewhere.
