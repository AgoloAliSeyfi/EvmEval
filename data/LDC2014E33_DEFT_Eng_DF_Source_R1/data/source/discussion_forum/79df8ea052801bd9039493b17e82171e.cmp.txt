My mum died of cancer last April and I can't cope without her. She was my best friend and we did everything together. I saw her all the time and we spoke about 6 times a day on the phone up until she was very ill in her last weeks and sleepy with morphine.

I have suffered from anxiety and depression in the past and she was the one person who could calm me down and make everything alright. Yesterday I was due to have an operation to remove my gallbladder and I was actually at the hospital and booked in when I told them I was feeling unwell and left.

I am so scared of having the operation and imagine all the horrible things that could go wrong, I had an op once before but mum was helping me cope with my nerves and helped me go through it. Yesterday I just kept thinking I need mum, I can't do it without her. It's so stupid because I will still have to have it done and she won't be there.

I sit at home during the day and cry and cry. I hold my hands together and keep praying she will come back, I say over and over again "Please come back, please come back" like it will make a difference but I know it can't happen, I just want a miracle.

My husband tries so much to help and is so kind but it isn't the same and i'm scared of stressing him out. The night before I was due my operation I was in such a state and he was trying to calm me and I saw his eyes were bloodshot. He has high blood pressure and I thought "Omg i'm going to end up killing him"

My kids are wonderful but my misery stresses them out, I really really try to hid it but they hear me blowing my nose alot and notice my eyes are red.

I have been on meds (citalopram) in the past but they make me feel really weird and I don't like taking them. I go to a counsellor which is great when i'm with her but when i'm alone I start feeling low again.

I hate myself for being so stupid and not coping. I'm an adult, and a wife and a mum. I know what a stress and misery I am for my family to be around, but I don't believe I will ever get better without mum here to help me. I miss her so so much, I need her back, I can't believe she has gone forever - it isn't possible.

I'm so desperate I just don't know what to do, I want to hide in a corner and pretend none of this is happening. Please please can someone tell me how to cope, or even just hold up for my family.

Your anchor has been ripped away and you are cut adrift on a stormy sea. Under the circumstances, when you were so very close this is completely understandable. It's very difficult to manage without someone who was so important in our lives. If the grief and loss is having an overwhelming impact on your life, then I suggest that you consider a different grief-couseller to try to learn how you can cope better and move forward to a happier life without her. If she were here with you now do you think she would want you to be so very unhappy? You are not stupid! You are suffering terribly and you need different help.

I lost my Mum and I felt the same way, for quite a long time, so I think I understand how it is for you. There is a good future and you will recover. You will

Angel, you don't need to hide the pain or hold up for your family. They can cope seeing your pain because they are stronger than you think. Your husband sounds lovely, Lean on him. Hard

So sorry for your loss and feeling so sad. I agree that you need to see the gp and try some counselling.

I had my gallbladder removed last April, keyhole surgery. I feel much better now, had to stay in hospital 2 days longer due to infection and having a drain but a month later I could eat a lot more food and felt physically better.

Sending lots of love x

It might be an idea to see your GP as a matter of some urgency. At the moment you're catastrophising everything, and it doesn't have to be like that.

I didn't want to read and run hun.

Definitely go back to your doctor, try and get some grief counselling, don't be afraid to lean on people for help. I do hope that you can find some comfort soon xxx

You're not stupid! It's not stupid that you're missing your Mum, it's perfectly understandable. You're overwhelmed. You need to talk to your GP again.

Do you talk to anyone about how you're feeling or are you bottling it up, trying to look like you're managing to cope with it all? I'm sure your children are worried about you and i'm sure they'd appreciate you telling them how you're feeling, rather than them fretting because they're seeing their Mum upset. Maybe they don't realise just how much it's affecting you, the same with your husband, and if they knew i'm sure they'd try and help you more. xx
