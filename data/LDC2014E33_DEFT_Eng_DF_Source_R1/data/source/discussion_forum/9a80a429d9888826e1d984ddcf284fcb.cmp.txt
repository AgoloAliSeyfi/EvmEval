Maybe it's because FOX has the good sense to not go all half cocked before anyone knows what the facts are.

Who in the media's been going "half-cocked" and how did they do it?

</quote>

Every single person who is assuming Zimmerman should be in jail just because the kid he shot was black.

Come to think of it, that would include you, which might explain why you don't see it. The police report indicated that Zimmerman had a cut on his head, the girlfriend said she heard some type of struggle over the phone before the shots, and there is even a witness that claims he saw that fight. All of that proves that Zimmerman told the police the truth.

What the police have to find out now is if Zimmerman instigated the confrontation. If he did, he should face charges. If he was just following him to make sure he didn't break into a house somewhere in the neighborhood, and Martin actually initiated, and escalated, the confrontation, he shouldn't. Until I know the facts I won't make a decision.

The "fight" was a result of Zimmerman PURPOSEFULLY CONFRONTING MARTIN WITH HIS PREJUDICE IDEALS....IDEALS RECORDED ON THE 911 TAPE.

WTF are YOU babbling about?

Because they're not shameful Liberal Media Race-Baiters. They leave that pathetic shite to CNN &amp; NBC. They still calling Zimmerman 'White?' Keep us updated.

Do you truly understand who created the term "hispanic" and what it entails, you libertarian lunkhead?

And as the 911 tapes shows, it wasn't "liberals" that brought race into the issue, but Zimmerman himself!

Get your head out of Ron Paul's ass, will ya please.

Racist.

Just as I thought....another libertarian lunkhead parroting the neocon/teabagger rhetoric...and when confronted, you got NOTHING (here's where this libertarian lunkhead excerpts part of my response in an "I know you are, but what am I" retort).

Why do you hate America so much? In America we have a thing called Due Process. We do not approve of Lynch-Mobs. I know that bothers you Socialists/Progressives, but that's the way it is. So get over it.

The more it looks like Zimmerman acted in self defense, the less you will hear of this case.
