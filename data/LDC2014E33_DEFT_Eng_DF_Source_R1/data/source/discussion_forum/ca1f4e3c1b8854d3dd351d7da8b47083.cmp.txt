For one thing, what's poor. To the billionaire, the mere millionaire is very poor. The poor in this country is beyond the wildest dreams wealthy of the poor in most of the world.

My step granddaughter is poor. She lives below the poverty line. Or does she? She is a single mother with four children from four different anonymous men. She lives in Section 8 housing, a nice three bedroom two bath apartment. Her utilities are all subsidized. She had benefit provided telephone service and a benefit provided cell phone. Her childen eat all three meals a day at school, but she still has a loaded EBT card. In addition, there are food banks and food pantries where she doesn't have to pay at all. My step granddaughter doesn't drive. When she wants to go someplace she has generously been provided a transit card to take the bus. If the bus doesn't go where she wants to go she can call for a car. There are a number of public benefit provided access cars. It would be unfair to say she doesn't work. She provides child care to her friend's three children. She gets a check every month for that. Her friend gets paid for providing child care to my step granddaughter's children. She gets her welfare check every month. She has never had to buy her children Christmas presents. They get dozens from any number of holiday giveaway programs. Two of her children have been diagnosed as having some form of hyper activity disorder. They get SSI.

All in all, her take home is in excess of $5,000 a month. She can afford to get her hair and nails done regularly. She can afford to pay for her medical marijuana which she needs for generalized stress. Getting this kind of medical care as a public benefit is something she is vitally interested in. She isn't rich, but she certainly is quite comfortable.

It wasn't always like this. She was going to join the Coast Guard and get job training. At one time she was considering culinary school and become a chef. She had dreams at one time but all that was leached away because being poor was just so easy and so comfortable.

Bummer dude. I wish them well. I could tell you a similar story, with the biggest difference being intervention. I have the children now, now they have a real chance.

In frequent threads here the brain-dead leftists moan about how the "idle rich" (like there is such a thing) don't deserve their money. But look at the other side. The poor in this country enjoy a lifestyle envied by even middle class people in most of the world. What have they done to deserve this? The idlest of the idle rich invest money and help other hard working people get ahead. The poor simply absorb tax payer funding and have babies.

I thought the "poor" was President Obama's brother living in a hut.

I think Bam Bam did send him an autographed picture which he has not sold on e bay yet.

His aunt a person of interest of I think in the Baltimore area. I think she gets poverty relief locally and not from him. For years.

I can't remember why her deportation to Kenya was stalled.

And his other uncle that was just got a DUI charge.

He's on the dole too I beleive.

Obama's a champ. His vision instead of helping any members of his family (it takes a village) or to help anyone else is to have a Johnny Depp party at the WH when Obama and Michelle could have fed thousands who need food and water.

What a champ!! And you go Michelle. Those hungry in Haiti tonight will really care that you can do push ups and jumping jacks.

Wow. Lots of neg reps and personal attacks. And not one person has answered the question.
If the left is so stuck on taxing the shit out of rich people because they dont work then why aren't they hep on cutting benefits for poor people who dont work?
Contumacious had it right: they vote. That's it.

Precisely. None. Most go into the military to defend thier nation on behalf of thier countrymen...even to defend RW'er.

Frankly I think RW is unmasking himself.
