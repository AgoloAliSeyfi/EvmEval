Very difficult to influence a 15 year old who is not living with you and who is living with someone with different views.

No- she probably will not do too well in her exams and it may be for her that she will learn the hard way and after a few low paid, boring jobs, if she can even get one in this financial climate, she may "grow up" and start listening.

It may be hard, but dont get on to her, she can catch up with qualifications later if she wants to.

Also, ditch the idea of working with animals. She does work experience because she has to and that is what she managed to get. If she had her heart set on it she would have jumped at the chances she has had to work more with animals. It is just a "twee" thing to say at 15.

I feel she may need support in other ways, like self confidence and self esteem over the short term future. Concentrate on that, on just being a friend and someone she can turn to for support and common sense once (if) she eventually realises what she really wants to do in life.

Try not to worry, there are enough of us on this board who started out with little in the way of academic qualifications, but are doing fine.

Good luck

I think that we all mature academically at different rates, many of my contemporaries that left school at 16 with few qualifications, have now entered university in their mid 20's I think it just took them a taste of the real world to value their education. With a bit of luck your step daughter will come to realise this too.

I fear you will only cause more harm than good if you keep on at her. You've done your bit a parents, now let her get on with it. She will very likely fail her exams but that's her responsibility not yours &amp; she is the one who will have to deal with the consequences. I did the same thing, despite lots of support at home. Left school at 16 with a handful of poor exam grades, went into a string of rubbish jobs, worked two &amp; sometimes three just to make ends meet. It was tough, but I knew it was my own fault! <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/redface.gif"/> Fast forward a few more years &amp; I went to university as a mature (!) student. I loved it, but know I would never have done it at 18. I went on to do a postgrad degree, now thinking of doing another, just for fun! <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/tongue.gif"/> :rolleyes: <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/biggrin.gif"/> I am also dyslexic, but didn't find out until I was in my 30s!
What I'm trying to say in amongst the ramble, is that it needn't be the end of the world for her if she fails her exams, not unless she wants it to be. Good luck, you have my sympathy!

To be fair, she has always wanted to work with animals. She used to want to be a vet, and we tried to encourage her, but now it's just the easiest route possible so that she can spend as much time as possible with her friends.

For some reason, her mother seems to think that if she fails her GCSEs next year she'll go to college and suddenly realise she needs them and start working, although she also thinks that SD should do the easiest course available so that it's not too hard for her, which seems rather contradictory to me. I think its more likely to be 5-10 years down the line that SD realises how important they are.
