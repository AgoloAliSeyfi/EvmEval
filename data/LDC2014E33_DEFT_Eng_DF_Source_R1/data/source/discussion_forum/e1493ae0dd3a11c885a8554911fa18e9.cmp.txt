than why the outrage over the Mosque at Ground Zero?

I am not sure I understand the context overall.... but I'll give it a whirl.

I saw that as a twitter btw, in any event if 20 guys like this guy went out and committed the same crimes, then there is most probably a common causality, here this isn't the case, he appears unbalanced and....the end of him is the end of this singular event via his madness that drove him to it. I think the mosque and what we see as motivating factor behind Khobar towers, the embassies, the Cole, 911, Hasan are linked, it doesn't disappear with just 20 Terrorists.

The context is to simply point out that Palin says one thing, but does another.

For the larger issue, If you are going to take that route, then is Islam an inherently evil/violent religion?

what thing has she done and what other thing has she done?

as far as evil? no of course not, but its best we be on our guard, theres only one or 2 threads that ties the overarching threat together...*shrugs* what are we supposed to do forget the minute after a T act is committed or self bungled or unsuccessful for whatever reason?

The mosque issue itself? I wish they would employ understanding and display sensitivity myself...

My opinion of it might change if they showed respect to the survivors and families who perished at the WTC.

Barring that, they're nothing but self-centered ideologues.

So, how much stand off does Ground Zero get?

And do we limit any new buildings (short of a monument) or just the religions that offend us personally.

</quote>

If a legitimate group of survivors families asks for respect, then a religion of peace should honor that.

If they don't, then they're offensive assholes.

They are not asking to clear out all of lower Manhattan of mosques.

</quote>

Some of those survivors were of the Muslim faith.

</quote>

So what? That doesn't negate the majority of survivors who don't want it there.

The quote in the title is hers. Opposing the mosque is the thing that she has done.

If "crimes begin and end with the criminal who committed them", then why hold an entire religion accountable for the actions of 19 people.

Apparently, reopening a Burlington Coat Factory.

Because that is what this house of worship and community center will replace.
