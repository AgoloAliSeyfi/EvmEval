Idiot, china isn't part of START.

China doesn't mind if Obamination lowers our nukes with "promises" from Russia doing the same or slightly less like they typically do. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_whistle.gif"/>

Uh, the word is leaking out that Obamination floated the idea which would be a surrender order if followed by the Pentagon.

I'm sure Gen Kehler kindly said...."This would endanger our nation if executed." Under his breath he said "Nuts."

A dew facts which belie the rightwing claims:
******************************************
The Pentagon's press secretary, George Little, declined to comment on specific force level options because they are classified. He said Obama had asked the Pentagon to develop several "alternative approaches" to nuclear deterrence.
The U.S. could make further weapons reductions on its own but is seen as more likely to propose a new round of arms negotiations with Russia, in which cuts in deployed weapons would be one element in a possible new treaty between the former Cold War adversaries.
Stephen Young, senior analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, which favors nuclear arms reductions, said Tuesday, "The administration is absolutely correct to look at deep cuts like this. The United States does not rely on nuclear weapons as a central part of our security."

You are hilarious! The START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) has nothing to do with the rotation of the earth favoring a missile launched from the WESTERN USA hitting China before one launched from China hit the USA. It is the rotation of the earth which influences strike.

Since peachy thinks we only have 14 ICBMs and they are used as "back-ups," we need to notify the 90 launch control officers and +200 security forces and maintenance personnel currently in the missile complexes that they can go home tonight...

You did not answer my question.

There is no answer; that problem REMAINS. Some of the material (as nuclear components are termed) is buried. Deep underground in areas where there are few earthquakes, or in lots of concrete.
***********************************************
In the United States alone, the Department of Energy states there are "millions of gallons of radioactive waste" as well as "thousands of tons of spent nuclear fuel and material" and also "huge quantities of contaminated soil and water."[13] Despite copious quantities of waste, the DOE has stated a goal of cleaning all presently contaminated sites successfully by 2025.[13] The Fernald, Ohio site for example had "31 million pounds of uranium product", "2.5 billion pounds of waste", "2.75 million cubic yards of contaminated soil and debris", and a "223 acre portion of the underlying Great Miami Aquifer had uranium levels above drinking standards."[13] The United States has at least 108 sites designated as areas that are contaminated and unusable, sometimes many thousands of acres.[13][14] DOE wishes to clean or mitigate many or all by 2025, however the task can be difficult and it acknowledges that some may never be completely remediated. In just one of these 108 larger designations, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, there were for example at least "167 known contaminant release sites" in one of the three subdivisions of the 37,000-acre (150 km2) site.[13] Some of the U.S. sites were smaller in nature, however, cleanup issues were simpler to address, and DOE has successfully completed cleanup, or at least closure, of several sites.[13]

Some of this is from old nukes.

Nuclear plants and nuclear medical waste, not weapons.

HERE IS THE FIRST PART OF THE QUOTE:

Due to historic activities typically related to radium industry, uranium mining, and military programs, there are numerous sites that contain or are contaminated with radioactivity.
