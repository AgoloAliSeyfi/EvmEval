what about his tax cuts for the middle class and poor? i'm not rich and they saved me $2400 last year.

</quote>

seriously, i've tried to tell uber libs this and they can't accept it. at the time i was in school and not making a lot of money, yet i got the tax cuts (actually rebate). the old guy next to me on a fixed income, partial supp income, got the tax cuts, and on and on.....ironically the old guy, a repub, thought it was stupid as since he was single, what the darn hell is $600 bucks going to for him....

the fact is, the tax cut/rebate he gave both times put money into mostly the lower to middle class folks. if you made over a certain amount, you didn't get the bush rebate.

most libs accept this, but the uber left continues in denial

Tomorrow is the State of the Union and Obama will be talking about the huge deficit we have. Why didn't we ever hear about it during the Bush admin when during his admin the national debt was more than doubled? The deficits were huge!

But Bush hid them. He didn't put the two wars in the budget like Obama is doing. Remember all those emergency supplementals that congress voted on every few months? 250 billion here, 500 billion there, to fund the wars. We don't have those anymore, because the wars are funded, out in the open, by the budget.

But now, we see the deficit spending that these wars are causing, and suddenly everyone's all outraged.

This money has been draining our treasury for 8 years already.

The 2009 debt number is from the Bush administration's fiscal year. When they post the 2010 numbers, that will be Obama's.

So I was just wondering why the media is so stupid? They keep talking about the huge deficit in the Obama admin. But they never mentioned the doubling of the national debt under the Bush admin. Are they really so stupid that they didn't realize all those war supplementals weren't in the budget and therefore hidden away each year?

You are right. The media is stupid.

Reagan and the two Bushes created 92% of the National Debt by lowering taxes on the rich and increasing wasteful military spending.

</quote>

And yet Republicans dishonestly claim to be the party of fiscal responsibility.

Why do they keep lying?

</quote>

Because people keep believing them.

The Big Lie of the Republican Party is the tax cut.

If you cut taxes and raise spending, you are actually raising taxes and passing the debt on to the next President.

I wish I invested in Apple back in December of 08. Would of made over double what I had originally invested.

I mean eleven times what you invested? Deals like that don't come around often.

Though I have a feeling that China's bubble is going to take a hit in the near future.

I read recently that the two bubbles which will pop next are oil and gold.

All those people that bought gold from Glenn Beck's sponsors are going to be pissed.

I made a few bucks in gold last year. I'm out now. I'd love to see oil prices plummet.
