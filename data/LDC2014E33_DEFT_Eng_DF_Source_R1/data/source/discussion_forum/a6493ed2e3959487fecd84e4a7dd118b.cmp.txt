And yet another reason to get government out of marriage except for governmental matters of taxes, inheritance, and power of attorney for emergencies and medical decisions....

Again.. all a ploy for forced acceptance and government interference on one side.. and on the other side, not wanting to reduce government's scope

</quote>

power of attorney can be handled locally. Inheritance is a right. Goverment should have diddly to do with it. Taxes should be simplified so that marriage or family relationships are null and void, a non sequitor item.

government should have nothing to do with inheritance rights? really?

damn... and to think every state has trusts and estates laws governing how estates are handled. these issues have always been dealt with by government. rights of dower, courtesy, inheritance,

you claim not to want government interference, yet you're ok with government interfering in the relationship between two people. and it's ok for government to tell me i can't purchase birth control?

i think you might want to work on consistency.

Those are all government rules. I state. Abolish them all.

Here are a couple of examples of "marriage" in Civil Law, abolish Civil Marriage and here would be no recognition under the law:
1. There would be no transfer of property to a spouse (since there would be no such thing as "spouse" under the law. As such the surviving spouse would be subject to a tax liability upon the transfer of property between people not recognized as legally married.

2. It would eliminate the exemption form the Estate Tax applicable to the sale of a primary home, only Civil Marriage does that. (When a home is sold a single person can claim up to $250,000 in an exemption, $500,000 for a Civilly Married couple. When one spouse dies the surviving spouse can still claim the married exemption for up to two years after the death if the home is sold. No spouse, no exemption - the survivor is taxed like a single person.)

3. No spousal privilege in the case of a criminal prosecution.

4. Since there would be no "spouse", they could not be buried in a National Cemetery next to a spouse who was an honorably serving veteran of the United States.

5. Without the legal recognition of "spouse" there would not be automatic conveyance of parenthood upon the birth of a child.

6. Since there would be no spouse, there would be no establish family relationship recognized under the Family Medical Leave Act so that a person can care for their spouse (or be cared for by them) in times of medical emergency.

7. Since there would be no "spouse", employees would become liable for employer portions of health insurance because there would be no waiving of the tax penalty for employer provided health insurance for a spouse. (For Civily Married couples, the employer portion of Health Insurance is tax free, however on plans where the significant other is not a legal spouse - then the federal government charges that portion as income and is liable for taxation.)

8. No "spouse" means no family relationship under Social Security whereby the surviving spouse can receive benefits at the working spouses rate if higher then their own.

9. No "spouse" means no established a family relationship where a spouse can then sponsor their spouse for immigration purposes.

and to just round it out to 10...

10. No "spouse" means that military members will not be able to draw pay and benefits for dependent spouses: no housing allowance, no medical benefits for the spouse, no accompanied tours where the government provides for travel expenses of the spouse, etc... If there is no Civil Marriage, there is no recognition, and so those things all disappear.

Those are a few things that will happen if the government stops recognizing Civil Marriage off the top of my head. I'm sure that idea will win great support amongst the populous.

These are all F'n government rules. I say abolish them all. If I want to transfer property to my goldfish so be it. The government didn't have any thing to do with it.

</quote>

Take away Social Security from the elderly, take away inheritance without tax exemptions, take away home sales without taxing profit, take away money from military families and the ability to have a spouse moved when transferred on orders, take away job protected leave to care for a sick family member...

... You should run for office, I can see that as a winning platform.
