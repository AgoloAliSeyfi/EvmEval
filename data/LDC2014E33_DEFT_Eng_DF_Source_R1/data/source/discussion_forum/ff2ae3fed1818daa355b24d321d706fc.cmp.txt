If anyone has a problem with the EDL, the things they do, they way they do it, or even just the fact that some shops are closed on the days of the protests, then you can thank the liberal governments we've had over the past 50 years.

If the government since the 1950's hadn't allowed mass immigration groups like the EDL/NWI wouldn't exist. groups like the EDL are something specific to multi-cultural nations, it's part of the multi-cultural package. People have got to understand that you can't have this nice fluffy utopia and not have the popular backlash.

So if anyone has a problem with any anti multi-cultural organisations, you can blame the progressive/liveral governments from the apst 50 years.

What a load of crap. You reckon that anti-immigration parties wouldn't course trouble if we decided to ban/massively reduce immigration, well that's a good plan, why don't we convert to communism at the same time so left-wing protests don't effect you so badly. You can't ever please everyone, the EDL is a (very) small group of morons, and the problem if anything is not liberalism or pro-immigration policies but people like Cameron feeding their fire telling everyone that multiculturalism has failed just before a major EDL demo.

Liberals have a lot to answer for. I use the term 'liberal' as a slur precisely because of things like this.

I also use the term liberal as a slur. It was one a noble idea in the days of slavery and empire but now it is a financially and intellectually bankrupt set of ideas which is alligned to global communism i.e. Free borders, let all our comerads in, bankrupt the nation if thats what it takes to give people what we think they need. And the idea of the nation state itself is seen as irrelevant and not worth saving etc.

Yep, these ideologues are only liberal when they're spending everyone else's money. And then they expect to be congratulated for their public displays of selflessness and compassion!

Rubbish, somebody that argued against British Imperialism and fought for colonial independence = a left wing hero, when British people stand up for exactly the same values in their own country they're written off by the left as "right-wing hardliners."

It's you that's getting your labels all mixed up and applying double standards, not us.

Oh... I hadn't realised that we were suffering military occupation by a foreign power....

Yeah, this is exactly the same as The Scramble for Africa... <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/>

Sane people dont give a **** about the EDL tbh. They're just a bunch of nutters who get wasted every friday night and end up in the local A&amp;E, totally pissed out their faces.

That describes pretty much all of Essex.

Except the EDL leadership have stated in interviews that they have no problem with other races or peoples coming into the UK- they have a problem with Islam or at least, 'radical' Islam.

Now bear in mind the EDL formed after the whole Luton army march thing, which was of course a direct product of the state choosing to go to War in Iraq and Afghanistan- a group decided to protest against the soldiers and the state as an extension of this- something the EDL opposed because, rightly, soldiers shouldn't be shouted down for basically doing their jobs- or, if they should- then so should basically every public sector worker. The EDL was designed to effectively counter Muslim demonstrations against the British Army- which has little to do with liberalism, or liberal political economy- rather, it has more to do with politics. This is especially prevalent considering the EDL's inherent hatred of the left- who are usually anti-state, anti- military industrial complex and certainly anti-liberal (in a political sense).

Secondly, the term 'multiculturalism' is a ridiculous phrase, that has been abused by politicans who are apparently proponents of it, and the media who use it to dehumanise particular groups at the extent of others. Cultures are not defined by race- they tend to be more defined by class. So in that respect, the existence of different cultures inherently exists in any major town or city in the world- even if the majority of people are from the same ethnic background. You only have to look in particular areas of Russia (Moscow/ St Petersburg) or even Japan to see that different cultures exist in the same geographical location despite little to no immigration. The result is that multiculturalism in its purest sense must exist in a society that promotes free markets (which is thus related to Capitalism as a political model- something the EDL has little problem with).

The truth is that the EDL has no idea what it actually stands for. It itself is a group that is heavily divided in potholes of racists, classists, people who are genuinely against radical islam and people who just want to have a laugh on saturdays. As a result, it is basically like any other social movement that loses its organic base- it eventually depletes into nothing while trying to justify its existence.

tl;dr- the EDL does not exist as a symptom of liberalism or liberal political economy.

Agreed with most of this.
