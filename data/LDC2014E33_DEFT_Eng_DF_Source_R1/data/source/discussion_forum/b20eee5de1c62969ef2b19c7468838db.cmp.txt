i'm largely against it

it only causes problems, disagreements, tensions, and makes people ''racist'' if they previously were once not

would you rather send your child to an all white school ??

or a school with 30 languages spoken full of africans, mexicans, albanians etc

You can nit pick details and say ''whites commit crime too''.

But I think you are clever enough to get my point

I don't need to get your point lol, I completely agree with you.

Err.. have you actually read the link i have posted? Do you really think France would declare a state of emergency for 3 months because of " a few youths?" Two people died, over two thousands were arrested, hundreds were injured. Immigration policies were changed because of these riots and immigrants deported. This riot was just a symptom of a much bigger issue. There is a tremendous anti-islam and anti-arab sentiment in France and the far right is very popular there.

As far as i know the northern suburbs of Paris are almost entirely inhabited by immigrants or other ethnicities and many whites would never dare to go there. A multiethnic workforce alone is not proof that multiculturalism works. France is one of the most anti-immigrant countries in Europe and Paris reflects this. Paris really is the worst example you could have given to back up your argument,

Again, you are wrong. Actually the Netherlands have one of the strictest integration laws when it comes to language. Maybe you have been living there before this law came into place. But certainly things have changed: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_law_for_immigrants_to_the_Netherlands">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integra...he_Netherlands</a>

Who is bending over for men like who? Not sure what characteristis you are referring here to. By they, i guess you mean the Dutch society.
Only because no one attacks you or confronts you personally does not mean that this is proof that there is no anti-immigration feeling in the Netherlands.

Racism comes in many forms, violence is only one. All one has to know is that the Freedom Party in the Netherlands is the third largest party and its support is growing. Now why would so many ppl support this party if they do not have an issue with immigrants?

I have even seen on this forum people asking others what caste they are from. It might be officially dead and not as prevalent as in little villages, but you cannot tell me that people in Mumbai or Bangalore happily interact with untouchables or would let their children marry them.

Again, you keep on bringing up violence. Racism has so many more layers. For integration to happen it must occur on a social level as well. Working for the same company is not enough. You would have to look at the positions one works in. I can assure you that the majority of immigrants in Europe work at the lowest level, the fewest are sitting in the board of directors. Immigrants are longer unemployed after university, it is harder for them to get an internship or a job interview etc.. etc..

The same applies to renting flats out to immigrants etc... This is no violent racism yet it still is very common. Only because people are not massacring each other does not mean multiculturalism has succeeded.

There is hardly any social interaction between immigrant groups. In most cities there are pockets where people are segregated into different neighbourhoods according to their ethnicities or nationalities. Parallel societies are a result of multiculturalism.

Well, just an assumption, but if there is no shortage of jobs in Dubai, why would ppl care about immigrants? Here people associate immigrants often with negative attributes like crime, stealing jobs etc... Dubai obv is a completely different situation since many of these expats are not poor, hence there is not such a strong correlation to crimes. Laws are much stricter. I do not think the government has any integration policies in place and it does not care if there is any interaction taking place. But still Dubai is divided into pockets of locals and expats.

Why do you find it favourable if different ethnicities live together in a city but there is no interaction between them and parallel societies have emerged ?

a lot of this (esp in britain) is to do with cultural differences and norms, something which can't be addressed to lead to "INTEGRATION"

because when people see disproportiante black on white crime

the ethnic nationalists come along with the ''solution''

Ethnic conflict has existed in Europe for centuries

Why deny that it could happen again ?

</quote>

Can you show me the part in which I denied that "it" could happen again?

Which black people are you talking about concerning crime? Black British/Black African/ Black Caribbean/ Black other. I am sure you would know that there are vast differences between them despite being placed in the same group.

What solution would the "ethnic nationalists" come up with?
