VA benefits. They ware what keep many bums in the streets alive. Then there are the criminals that use them to restart their lives. Oh yeah, front of the line for all those government jobs conservatives want to cut.

Conservatives love veteran's benefits because it helps people they've thrown out of work

Those VA Benefits doesn't include car payments or mortage [ sic] payments shit stain.

Using the conservative logic of the day -- as with Planned Parenthood, government payments subsidize other actions. Recipients are able to afford mortgage payments and car payments because the welfare subsidies ( VA benefits), handouts, free up other monies

This is exactly what I'm talking about when I speak of the growing disconnect between the Military and the Civilian sector, you obviously never served a damn day in your life. VA Benefits are a case by case basis and that amount is different for everyone depending on their disabilities, and they are not hand outs you stupid fuck.

You are the kind of stupid that there is no coming back from. VA benefits aren't a hand out, they are not welfare, they are earned from time in combat and time in service. You know, fight for the country boom truck hit by an ied wow 200 a month few more times I might have a decent check on my hand.

Its just illustrating my point on how far the divide is between the Veteran/Military and Civilian sectors, we ain't seen nothing yet. As the more time goes on the 20 year retirement plan for the Military will be scrapped and all the Active Duty soldiers will have to fend for themselves for healthcare, housing and combat pay will be eliminated as well.

And to think of the sacrifices you, me, HG, and our families endured...

Pathetic - and totally unpatriotic.
