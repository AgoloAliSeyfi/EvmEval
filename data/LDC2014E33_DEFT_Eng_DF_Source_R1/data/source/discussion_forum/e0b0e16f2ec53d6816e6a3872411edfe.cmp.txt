I just found out Wanda was black...maybe she has a good reason to hate on Rush the racist. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_eh.gif"/> Not that I think she meant it as anything but a joke.

Damn, you guys have been milking this all week.

They'll milk it until a new "faux outrage" can be found. 'Tis the way of politics, everyone else has to be out to get you, and your own leaders can do no wrong.

so the democrats hate Rush as much as the Jews hated Hitler?

Some may... some Reps may to... you never know.

Maybe Wanda does.

How do you feel about anyone that wants you to fail?

How do you feel about terrorists who say Death to America?

Or how would you feel about a president who lied us into a war and got thousands of soldiers wounded and killed, or a radio host who was in on it? Seems the last time a soverign country was invaded like that was when Hitler invaded Poland for no reason.

And we don't hate Rush anymore than he hates us.

1. Obama's pastor said "God damn America". Obama continued to support him by attending his church and you still voted Obama.
2. PROVE Bush lied. Oh that's right, you can't.
3. It's an insult to those Hitler murdered that you compare Bush to him.
4. the last time a sovereign nation was invaded? Did you forget about Iraq invading Kuwait?
5. Did Rush say he wants Obama to fail or did the media twist it into him saying he wants America to fail?

Now that I've googled the meaning of kidney failure it is actually funnier. Imagine Rush blowing up like a balloon and exploding because he can't pee. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/rofl.gif"/> Poetic justice for a fat blowhard.

you have done it now Ravi. The PC police are going to be after you.
I also love how the right always says we are the PC Police but the first time someone make an un PC comment they are all over them.

</quote>

so you think wishing someone dead on national television is a PC issue? or are you just as partisan as you sound?

insane is more like it..
