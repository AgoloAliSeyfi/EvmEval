I don't know about anyone else, but ever since 2012 was appointed as the next "for sure" date of the apocalypse by most of the internet crackpot brigade I have been kind of anxious for the year to get here! I have read so many threads since the early 2000s by so many individuals who are just so absolutely sure that this is the either (1) the end of the world through fire and brimstone or (2) some sort of new age ascendancy via aliens/vibrations/whatever. Since neither will happen the excuses come December 22, 2012 should be fun.

I thought we'd kick off the year of the apocalypse/new age beginning by seeing if we could come up with what the excuses will be when nothing occurs. And most important - what will the new date of doom be? I think in the tinfoil hat mindset there must always be some sort of end date, otherwise, whats the fun of being in perpetual panic/hysteria over world events?

For my part, I know some of what the 2012 cult will do is point to any sort of big news event that happened during the year and use them as "proof" that this year is somehow unusual. They will ignore that whatever the events are have happened previously, and that there has been no more bad news/events this year in terms of "volume" or "destruction" than any other year. Then they will claim that it was the work of the glorious conspiracy theorists exposing the truth that pushed back the apocalypse to give us another chance.

Nibiru destruction will just be moved to a new date no conspiracy needed. I do feel the same thing will just happen like Y2K something minor will happen in the world, but nothing catastrophic or doomsday will occur.

Pre-emptive CT callouts are not that great IMO
