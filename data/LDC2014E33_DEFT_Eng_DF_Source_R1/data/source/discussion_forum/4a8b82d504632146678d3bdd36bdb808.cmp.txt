Well, obviously you aren't a conservative female in this mode

27 years old; wife, homemaker, mother of three; has never worked a day in her life in a "business". I'm not even sure that she's ever voted. Her wedding vows included the words..... "With this ring I thee wed. With this body I thee worship. With all my wordly possessions I thee endow."

</quote>

or of the quiverfull variety or you wouldn't be neglecting your domestic duties prattling on about men's business, like politics and worldly affairs.

Do you leave yourself in a state of complete dependence on men for anything outside of the household? If not, you are not a true conservative woman. You have some feminazi equality mumbo jumbo in your poke.

You're an idiot and can't read. I already addressed this.

So this is twice you get your ass kicked by a conservative woman!

While I agree with the premise of your comments; that Conservative women are definitely a group that it is acceptable to attack in our society; your analogy has a major hole in it.....

Sarah Palin is about as Conservative as Josef Stalin. Conservative women are individuals like my sister-in-law.... 27 years old; wife, homemaker, mother of three; has never worked a day in her life in a "business". I'm not even sure that she's ever voted. Her wedding vows included the words..... "With this ring I thee wed. With this body I thee worship. With all my wordly possessions I thee endow." THAT is a Conservative woman. Not some half-baked, ego inflated PTA mother who can't even keep her own home in order, nevermind actually carry through on the term of her elected office.

EXCUSE THE BLEEDING HELL OUT OF ME??????????????

Are you telling me that ONLY WOMEN WHO STAY HOME AND BAKE COOKIES ARE CONSERVATIVE????????????

ARE YOU REALLY SAYING THAT WITH A STRAIGHT FACE?

Dude, I'm a stay a home mother now, but I WORKED PLENTY in my young married years.

I worked full time, took care of a baby, and a house.

I had to, we couldn't afford for me to stay at home at the time.

THERE IS NOTHING in your wedding vows that says a woman can't work and there is even a Proverb about how the good wife works.

She works both IN and OUT of the home.

Right now, I'm planning to go back to work since I have one kid who is now an adult, and the other is practically in high school (one more year and she will be).

There is nothing in my wedding vows that says otherwise and I have my husband completely behind the idea (hell, we can use the dough).

Is anyone going to even TRY to say I'm not conservative????????

You just don't know what you are talking about.

Proverbs 31:10-31 (King James Version)

10 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.

11 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.

12 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.

13 She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.

14 She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.

15 She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.

16She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.

17 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.

18 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night.

19 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.

20 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.

21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.

22 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.

23 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.

24She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.

25 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.

26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.

27 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.

28 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.

29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.

30 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.

31 Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.

As I suspected, you have no proof otherwise, because there is no proof, only accusations.

Bill Clinton Cheated on his wife.

You dont cheat on your wife if you respect women, yourself, or your marriage.
