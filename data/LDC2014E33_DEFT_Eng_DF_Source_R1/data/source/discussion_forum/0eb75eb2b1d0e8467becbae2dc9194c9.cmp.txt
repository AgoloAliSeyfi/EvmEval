Sounds like the wife had a bailout plan in place. She might have pitched it as 'just in case he tries to kidnap the kids' but that doesn't sound like a good reason to pre-arrange a bank account and a place to stay. If he does kidnap the kids, he's gone. What difference does any of that stuff make?

I'd speculate, on the same evidence as everyone else has, that she was looking to move out, and did so when the time was right, i.e. when he wasn't there to interfere. Doing it mysteriously has the additional benefit of tying her soon-to-be ex husband up for a while while the police investigate him. In the meantime, he rents a car and goes looking for her in old haunts, in hopes of talking, serving papers, whatever. Presumably he doesn't find her, or he'd let the cops know and get the heat off himself.

Why does this scenario come to mind for me? Something almost exactly like it happened to me, when I was younger and dumber, mistook infatuation for love, and got myself hooked to a crazy little girl. The only difference was the mystery. She told me she was going, face to face. I came home too early, and she was still sitting on a suitcase waiting for the taxi to the airport, in a mostly empty house from which she'd stripped everything of value, packed it up, and shipped it to her new undisclosed address. Instead of mysteriously disappearing so the police would keep me from following she just stripped me of resources. Bank account emptied and overdrafted, savings gone, credit cards maxed out the previous day... In terms of money, I had what was in my pocket at the moment. You can't go far on $37.50

How did this girl learn to do this to someone? Her mother had done the same to her father, and then again to her stepfather. Times were tough where we were, and we weren't living the american dream. She asked mom for advice, and mom suggested a fresh start in sunny florida, and told her how to set it up. It's not an unheard of thing.

What did I do? I moved out of the house, as I couldn't afford the rent alone, spent the summer crashing on a friend's couch and sleeping in my car, and went back to college. I don't find it unusual that this guy rented out his house. That makes the house pay its own mortgage. A sudden separation represents a big and sudden drop in income. You do what you have to do.

Instant Karma/shadenfreude moment: two months after she left, she made the tampa news when she got into a fenderbender on the interstate, forgot to check traffic before she ran out onto the road, and got her pelvis crushed by a semi-truck.

Dude, your personal experience aside, it is very unlikely that this woman just up and left without a trace, and walks the land somewhere unbenownst to the police and her family. It is very easy for the police to track someone these days. The police have no doubt tracked her credit cards, her bank accounts, her cell phone usage, her credit history since the disappearance, and contact with her family. The fact that they are still trying to figure out what happened to her is pretty convincing evidence (at least to me) that they have found nothing--that all indications that she was a living person just came to a sudden stop in December, 2009. The fact that her family has not heard from her is yet more evidence. Without any reasonable doubt, this poor woman has been the victim of foul play and no longer walks this earth.

If you wanted me to place a bet on this story, then yes, I would put money on foul play. If you wanted me to reach a conclusion to a standard of evidence required in a murder trial, then I'd say hell no. There have been women (admittedly not a lot) who have planned their escape and left cell phones, credit cards, and even kids behind.

Any halfway intelligent fugitive can figure out ways around the easy ways of tracking. A pocket full of cash and a pay-per-minute cell phone for starters. The article mentions that she was known to have made preparations to run off and hide. I'm just assuming that she's good at it.
