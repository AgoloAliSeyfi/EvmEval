@z0z0,

I do not believe in the whole "Global Warming is a Bad Thing" circus.
Sadly many people are suckered up in it.

My view on Global Warming;

I like clean air and water. As a people, mankind has but one planet and to work in conjuction with our planet, I believe, is a wise investment in our future.

As a capitalist country, I theorize our America's primary social goal is attached to status. And a primary status measure in America is financial status. Based on those personal opinions, I would further theorize, America is primarily motivated by financial gain.

So, when we can prove helping the environment is also financially smart, then we will see real change.

"I fwwl that the GW movement is primarily a political movement."

I agree.

"What are the objectives of this movement? Usually the best thing to do is to "follow the money" - who benefits?"

I agree.

"My theory is that GW is part of the economic warfare between China and the West."

"My theory is that GW is part of the economic warfare between China and the West.

I would agree because the true argument over global warming is financial.

1. If West falls prey to GW then people will want to drive less or drive more efficient cars.

Okay.

If Western oil consumption drops then so does the price of oil. The wealthy West can afford oil at $60 per barrel but China can't. It is in China's best interest to get the price of oil down.

Certainly, china's natural resources are limited. As far as affordability, I think China still owns most of the United States debt.

2. If the West decides to clean up their industries then there will be a significant added expense to running manufacturing shops in the West.

Perhaps. But I would like to see documented evidence.

"China has proven it does not care about pollution and so its economy will not be hindered or hobbled by "the clean up".

True. However, I firmly believe the West does not care about pollution either unless there is profit.

"3. It is known that during the Cold War, the Soviet Union funded left-wing patsies to hold protests of one sort or other to disrupt society. The Chinese can be following those examples"

I assume you mean this is common knowledge not opinion. I would argue the West does exactly the same thing.

By "left wing', I think you mean hard nosed communist "right wing" political thought. Not sure of your definition of "left wing".

Because of the Communist mentality split between China and the Soviet Union in the 1950s and 1960s, it may be possible, but I dont think China is using the Soviet Union's model for political gain through social upheaval.

"The worst thing for Americans could be that Al Gore is a Chinese patsy."

The worse thing for America is that ANY elected official or prominent figure would support another country's agenda to the detriment of our American society.

If global warming and Al Gore's position support China, does that mean the oil industry and George W Bush's position of financial gain through that industry support Saudi Arabia? It seems like it's vague enough that it could.

And by West, do you mean Western European based cultures or does Japan fit in to your defintion?

@Willie cv,

I just watched PBS documentary

Hot Politics
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/hotpolitics/">FRONTLINE: hot politics | PBS</a>

Interesting quote was that 93% of scientists in the Global Warming debate are Democrats.
Sounds like politics to me!

Must we label everyone. What political party does the indiviual who wrote/produced the program belong to? Who exactly reported the political party of those scientists? Is that responsible journalism?

@z0z0,

PBS, the same one that cut the documentary on extreme Muslims cause it wasn't nice enough to them? Sounds pretty unbiased and reliable to me.

@Reagaknight,

Yes - political affiliation is important to know because it shows potential agenda. If 93% of scientists involved are Democrats then you know that there is something unusual going on. It is an odd phenomenon worth examining further.

Since the US is about 45% Democrat and 45% Republican and 10% Swing - I would expect 2,000 scientists to be similar political split. Since the the GW gang is not similar to the population as a whole I find that odd.

It seems there is some self-selection going on in who gets into the GW club and who gets to feed at the funding teat.

Or think of this - if someone offered you an 80,000 per year job with all sorts of nice lab equipment and travel to conferences - would you start promoting GW? Probably would.

I would, because I believe in protecting the environment.

But, I think the same financial incentive analogy can be said for the FDA and their funding for pharamaceutical research and development. (a different topic all together, just used as a comparison)

I need to watch the PBS documentary, forgive me for my ignorance regarding that film.

Did the documentary attempt to establish a political agenda attached to GW? Or is that your opinion?
