Blaming him for debt,deficits or the economy is as bad.

I know I know, Bush forced him not to make any spending cuts in order to pay for the war and he was powerless to keep the debt from increasing.

Also when Obama takes a crap, Otis Spunkmeyer cookies come out. True story.

Don't be silly now! and thanks for that image. He did make spending cuts. But you don't cut off your nose to spite your face. I am nore critical of him not protecting Americans fron vulture captialism(although a lot of legislation has been blocked), signing parts of the unPatriot Act and signing NDAA.

I don't see this as an issue worthy of such hysteria.

1. I haven't seen any Obama hates Israel threads in months.

2. As a regular Fox viewer I haven't seen it there in recent months either.

In fact I haven't seen it much at all since Obama made the ridiculous border statements.

Hopefully when Bush made the exact same border statements in a speech in the middle east, you also called them ridiculous.

Most republicans only freaked out when Obama said it.
