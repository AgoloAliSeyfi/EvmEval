<a href="http://media.nara.gov/9-11/MFR/t-0148-911MFR-00136.pdf">Mike Catalano</a>, head of security for Solomon Smith Barney in WTC7 on 9/11, says: the official WTC7 evacuation order was made after the second tower was hit, before the first tower fell; he assisted in setting up the loading dock triage centre but no-one came; then:

He was out on Vesey Street helping set this up when he was told to call Ed Campbell, the head of the building. He walked inside to call him and the
tower fell. There were 6 people at the phone center and they all lay on the floor while the building shook. It sounded like a missile or an earthquake... twisting metal he thought. The vents on the top of the building and on the 5th floor sucked in the air and jammed the generators and caused them to burn.

He went to the 4th floor cafeteria where he knew there was an emergency door. In fact, there were two emergency exits. The one door had a broken handle so it couldn't be used. The other door, when opened was full of fire and smoke (colored). He also looked out the window to see if they could jump onto the ConEd building but there was a huge fire there. So they chose to wrap their heads in wet towels and make the escape through the smoky stairwell. The stairwell was below the generators that were burning. They went through the stairwell and made it to the street. They climbed up to Barclay Street when the second tower fell and chased them through
the streets. He said large debris, the size of buses, was following them down the street.

He said the generators automatically went on for 27 minutes when the building shakes. So once the first tower fell and the smoke cleared, the building was lit. He said there were no tunnels out of WTC7 in spite of reports. He said the city people were the first to evacuate. He said that the
repeater system worked perfectly and their radios were blaring the entire time. Unfortunately, there is no tape of those calls.

Mike said that WTC7 would have collapsed even if the other towers had not collapsed because of the fires. He said there were 50,000 gallons of diesel fuel and 20,000 gallons of coolant. This was a huge fire.

<a href="http://media.nara.gov/9-11/MFR/t-0148-911MFR-00138.pdf">The SEC's Joe Cella</a> does a brief follow-up on insider trading, explaining why the number of puts vary depending on the report you read. Examples:

<quote>
On May 10, 2004, Cella called back with Eric Ribelin, who worked on the investigation for him. Cella confirmed that generally the OCC volume figures double the actual trading volume by counting the buy and sell sides as separate trades. There were several other anomalies in the data, explaining the discrepancies. Cella said that he spoke with John Fennel of the OCC, who confirmed Cella's reconciliation.

As to 9/6 UAL trading, the actual put volume was 1575 (1/2 the OCC figure) and not 2075 as indicated in the SEC report. Cella explained that the SEC relied on various sources of information to double check the volume data, including a Customer/Firm Market Watch Report. This report included the 1575 puts, but also included a 500 put sale that was canceled. The SEC failed to notice the cancellation and included the trade in the volume. As to 9/10, AMR trading, the SEC's 2,282 number was almost exactly half the OCC's 4,516, with the difference being the SEC's inclusion of certain LEAP options. Cella said neither these differences nor any similar differences in the volume..
data changed the SEC's conclusion that no illicit trading occurred in advance of 9111. He faxed over some materials supporting his reconciliation.

<a href="http://media.nara.gov/9-11/MFR/t-0148-911MFR-00152.pdf">Mark Evans</a>, another supervisor at Cleveland, says:

<quote>
He did not think anyone at the Center was responsible for notifying the military.
"Nothing in the requirements that he knows of to put military on alert right away," he
said. Commission staff asked if guidance would be given to the person in mil operations
position to call the military in the event of hijacking? Evans said that "Analytical
thinking is not what controllers are supposed to do. Even today, they wouldn't make that
decision. "
...
Even if he wanted to notify the military on that day, he would not have known who to
call. He reiterated that he would notify the Command Center, and focus on isolating the
plane.

He reported to have "Inquired numerous times if fighters were on the way." The response
he received is, "Higher authorities looking into it." Evans commented, "that didn't give
me a warm fuzzy at the time."
...
Since the primary target was firmly established at Cleveland Center and was heading
eastbound, Evans queried several times whether or not military assets had been scrambled. "It was clear that it was going to DC. I told CC that it was. They could not
have seen it on their TSD. CC was blind," Evans said...

<a href="http://media.nara.gov/9-11/MFR/t-0148-911MFR-00157.pdf">Kim Wernica</a>, ops manager at Cleveland, says she never thought the screaming heard over the radio (from flight 93) was Delta 1989. But she reports this curious phone call (not sure who made it):

<quote>
At one point, Greg Dukeman received a call (he was in the position of Military
Operations in the TMU that day) and handed it off to her. Wemica remembers the call
was from a female. She told her Delta 1989 was a confirmed hijack.
