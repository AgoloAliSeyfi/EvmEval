You really are not too bright... try to get this through your noggin:

youtube is not NBC: youtube is not ABC... youtube is not CNN...
youtube is not FOX media... youtube is not CNN... youtube is not cable TV

youtube is an internet outlet where private citizens all over the world casn post videos
It is a public form: the media blackout of the Gulf oil crisis is being done by:

CNN
ABC
NBC
FOX

this is because BP owns a large share of american media stock

but BP does not own the video cameras of hundreds o fcitizens on the gulf coast who broadcast their personal accounts: documenting the BP takeover of the public beaches by posting private security guards who had and have no legal authority whatosever: these corporate thugs do not allow reporters of local television station to interview the BP workers who are doing the cleanup: the scandal of the local towns exploded when they found out that these workers are there just for show: they are pre-warned ahead of time in case a big washington senator or Obama arrives: the second the entourage laves they stop working. Local grass roots groups to save their amarshlands and dolphns have picketed BP and received zero eresponse. These local groups are still fighting both their governments refusal to act and BP.

All of these post have been taken OFF youtube: they are not there anymore: there are not posts of the PRIVATE CITIZENS on the gulf about the worsening pollution and health problems the entire area is being hit with now.

For one month: now... now human being on earth has been allowed to post ANYTHING on youtube concerning the gulf crisis. The media blackout by the corporate news mass media is one thing... but when corporate control extrends to the freedom of disseminating information between private citizens: then you have a po0lice state of facist-corporate power which will not let you know anything they don'[t want to let you know: for instance:

BP was caught buying up local scientists in Louisiana: and making them sign waivers so they couldn't testify in court about the true extent of damage done to the economy and ecosystems.
BP has been caught buying up URL web sites on youtube and google: so anyone googling the gulf oil crisis will be automatically shunted to BP corporate ads and lies which do not give the viwers the truth about the situation.

are you getting the picture yet?... you are being brainwashed by BP and the media. Your entire freedom of speech does not exist: you can't tell anyone about what is going on in the gulf on a large internet web site: they will cut you out and block you and delete anything you post on youtube if it is pollitically incorrect. The media blackout extends to a censorship of private freedom of speech: wake up.

Has anyone noticed the media blackout going on in the Gulf?

Yes, the conventional media. There are all sorts of independent media reporting on the story, but that's not something that fits anyone's agenda.

So much for Faux Nooz being "biased." One would think they would run with the story, but they haven't.

So here's the story:

It's a big mess and needs some big cleanup.

It's not the catastrophe that was reported and fishing boats are heading back out.

The biggest problem now is the stigma that the entire Gulf is ruined and all beaches are 3 feet deep in oil muck so generally people are avoiding the entire area. Good for Ft. Lauderdale I guess - not sure why that Obama stronghold gets to win over the other Obama stronghold of St. Petersburg, but I think that's what happens when the government says it's going to pick favorites....

I went to youtube and checked out the Gulf oil crisis: all of the posts are one month old, or older...

How many million people post on youtube?
The first two months there were hundreds of private citizens with their video cams reporting about what was happening in the gulf... showing everyone firsthand eyewitness accounts of the incompetence of BP and the lack of government response.

Now there are none: zero: nobody has posted one single video on youtube about the gulf oil crisi for one month. This stinks to high heaven. Don't tell me nobody has posted anything on the gulf crisis for one month: there is a media bl;ackouit going on.

The left is busy gnashing their teeth and pouring dirt on their heads, lamenting the fact that it isn't...

THE GREATEST ECOLOGICAL DISASTER. EVER.

It's a sad day for them. They were hoping that all life would be eliminated from the earth, and just look what happens!

Even as coverage dies down, we'll soon be entertained by Obama's efforts to re-kill the Gulf economies through short-sighted legislation aimed at snuffing out petroleum operations...and jobs.
