"To know a person's religion we need not listen to his profession of faith but must find his brand of intolerance." Eric Hoffer

The idiocy inherent in this OP is that somehow tolerance and respect for all religions is a bad thing. No one is bending anywhere, this is America, there is religious freedom, is that not clear by now. The fascist element on the right wants to limit freedom for all religions over 911, they obviously know none of our history of interfering in other nations. If you occupy or interfere in a nation's internal situation you open yourself up to retaliation. Have any of the idiots who hate Islam ever turned their hatred on doctor killers in this nation, on McVeigh a Catholic who killed many, or Eric Rudolph, another Catholic, who thankfully was less successful? The same narrow minded idiocy that fills the heads of these murderers fills the heads of those who cannot respect all people. Hatred and stupidity have no national or religious bounds. Humankind is still a primitive animal who can kill over ideas that exist only in the mind.

"We first kill people with our minds, before we kill them with weapons. Whatever the conflict, the enemy is always the destroyer. We're on God's side; they're barbaric. We're good, they're evil. War gives us a feeling of moral clarity that we lack at other times." Sam Keen <a href="http://fora.tv/2010/03/11/Sam_Keen_In_The_Absence_of_God">FORA.tv - Sam Keen: In The Absence of God</a>

Why is it that Americans will bend over backwards to appease the Islam country's? Why is that we must walk around such issues like the 9/11 Mosque, and the Florida QurÂ’an bonfire? Is it from fear of an attack from a peaceful religion, It's a known fact they have killed Americans before without any provocation in the past. Like some of these attacks from the following link.

Dumb ass. I don't see anyone walking around either issue. Both that Iman, and that preacher have the right in this nation to do what they are proposing to do.

How wise these actions are in this present poisoned atmosphere of hate, both of the Radical Islamists, and the Rightwind Nuts in our nation is a subject of debate. However, under our Constitution, both have the right to do what they are proposing.

I might note that what I am seeing here is apparently the right wing thinks that the 1st Amendment can be suspended any time that it offends their prissy little sensibilities.

Not sure how we appease Islamic countries.

No one is walking around the mosque issue. Hell, its been a huge discussion for both sides of the issue. Theres nothing wrong with that. Thats the American way.

The Florida Quran burning has been the hot button issue of the last two weeks. Not walking around that.

To say people fear something because they discuss events is just not correct. To hate another people because of their religious beliefs is fear.

Im not afraid of anothers religious belief or color or creed or sexual preference. I love America and fear nothing.

Glad to hear that you do not fall into the media and obama hype of fear. If the crazy preac hers burns a few Muslim books so what If they get piss so what? If they kill so what? That was their plan all along. They do not need a reason to kill.

So, what youre saying is that its no big deal if the preacher burns the books even if they get pissed, right?

Another anti-Muslim thread from the hate monger who wishes to see them all dead, whether they be man, woman, or child. Whether they be innocent or guilty of any sort of crime.
