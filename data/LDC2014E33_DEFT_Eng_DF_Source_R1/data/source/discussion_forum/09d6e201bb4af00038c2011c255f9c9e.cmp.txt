Why did they lose their entire life? And why is that other Taxpayers' fault. You don't get to demand stealing from fellow Citizens just because your life didn't turn out the way you wanted. That's the same exact mentality Wall Street has. If your problem is with the Banks,then sue the banks and try to get some money out of them. I have no problem with that. But your real problem is still with Washington. They gave Wall Street all that Taxpayer cash. You guys are occupying the wrong places. Get to Washington. But don't demand your fellow Citizens pay for your own mistakes or problems with Banks. We're broke. The Entitlement Gravy Train is off the tracks and out of gravy.

<img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> Yea it does seem that most in the OWS Movement want to blame everyone but themselves for their own mistakes. That's why i can no longer support them. They had it right in the beginning when it was about being angry at Wall Street. I could get behind that. But then it became all about the Entitlement attitude. 'Generation Gimme' stepped in and hijacked the Movement. Now i just see them as Entitlement Whiners. And i think most Americans are now seeing them that way too. Anyway,thanks for the hilarious vid. It is classic.

Thats why I liked them at first too...but when the cries for a "guaranteed middle class job out of college" and "I shouldn't have to pay off my loans" amongst others started being more prevelant than anything else I became disgusted by them.

If the tea party stopped being about fiscal conservatism and the debt and transformed into a conservative social issues movement I would feel the same sense of disgust toward it.

Yea i think good honest people were there at the start of the Movement. But they were quickly booted and replaced with 'Generation Gimme' whiners. And i'm sure George Soros had a hand in hijacking the Movement too. It is sad but that's where it stands currently. I can no longer support them.
