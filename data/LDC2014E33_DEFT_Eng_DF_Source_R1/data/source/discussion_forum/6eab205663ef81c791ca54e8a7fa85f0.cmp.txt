Oh SHIT! Well, shit, why didnt you present that evidence earlier.

"Why didnt they say..." isnt proof of anything other than you thought up a question they didnt answer. Why didnt they ask Bush what happened to the millions that was lost in Iraq? Bias or they didnt ask?

Because I can think of questions they asked Obama and not Bush but what the fuck does that mean? Nothing.

hey..

They intervvciewed Newts X right before a primary.

Did they interview any of Obamas former class mates?
Did they interview any of Obamas parishoners at Wrights church?
Did they interview anyne part of the Resko company?

Heck...I got a question....who did they interview to dig up any dirt that may be out there about Obama?

Who from his past did they intertview?

</quote>

Hey,

They asked Obama about Bill Aires but never asked Bush about his relationship with the Bin Ladens...You know what that means...Yep, Media Bias.

We can do this all day but at the end of it all, it's just you laying out bullshit to claim you are the victim of the liberal media, liberal education, liberal historians, liberal scientists, liberal brainwashers, liberal washing machines that wont get that stain out etc.

It must be tough always being under attack...Thats when you let your conservadaddy hold you tight and tell you what a big bad world is out there and he'll protect you

you did not answer my question....

They interviewed Newts ex wife right before a primary.

They interviewed people that worked for companies once owned by Bain.

Who from Obamas past did they interview?

</quote>

Reverend Wright...any other assumptions?

</quote>

See how that works?

Exactly...Reverend Wright.

Obama claimed to know nothing about his sentiments.

Then he claimed he did but paid no mind.

So one answer was a lie...so we know he, like all politicians, will lie for political expediency.....

So exactly who did they interview to find out the truth?

You seem content with the truth....you know...."I didnt know of them....oh yeah...he was my mentor...so yes...I knew of them....but I never really paid attention..."

And you were just fine with that.

And to you? The media did a great job.

He answered the question, numbnuts. The answer was her allegation was false. He offered evidence and the networks ignored it.
Or did you miss that part?

It was a "when did you stop beating your wife" question. He handled it very well.

No way the "media" is bag for ANY republican. Whatever they do in the primaries for or against a republican is what they think will be best for the democrats.

Right, because those corporate owned media outlets ALWAYS favor the party that doesn't favor them. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/new/laugh.gif"/>
