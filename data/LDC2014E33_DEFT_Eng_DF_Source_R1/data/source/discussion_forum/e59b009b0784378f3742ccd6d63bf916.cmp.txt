Seriously, doesn't this hurt?

It's a great argument.

If you don't agree, refute it.

Okay, let me see if I can explain, Missourian.

For the days since the terrible shooting in Arizona, Revere and I have been arguing. I have said the violent rhetoric should be foreclosed, and he has said I am undercutting free speech. He does not at all agree that an atmosphere of such speech may make such tragedies likely to recur.

"Only the shooter is responsible", he keeps saying.

But in the case of the Park 51 Mosque, he seems to do a complete backflip. Now ALL American Muslims, all mosques, are somehow responsible for 9/11. Now, a tenuous connection (that only exists if you agree with his beliefs about the role of religion in that tragedy, and I do not) between those who commit a crime and those whose speech MAY support their ideas (and other premise I'm not buying) should be used to foreclose freedom of religion.

Consistency is not exactly Revere's hallmark here.

He still makes a good point...one I've made myself.

I have as yet to meet a Muslim I didn't like.

And even tho Sunni Man and I often disagree, I like him personally.

But I still oppose the GZ Mosque for the exact reason Revere put forward.

Just like I would oppose a Shinto Shrine built at Pearl Harbor during WWII or a Glock outlet opening next to the Safeway in Tuscon next month.

When Muslim extremist are no longer plotting to kill us, we can revisit the subject.

I felt similar to you at the outset. Then I realised that you are punishing people through no fault of their own.

So, those good "christian" folk in Mississippi who killed those three civil rights' boys back in the 60s should have their local church demolished?

Where did Timothy McVeigh discuss the Oklahoma bombing with Terry Whatshisname? The local Taco Bell? And if so, is that to be demolished, too?

I'm having trouble with you analogy.

No one is saying an existing mosque should be demolished. The debate is whether or not a new mosque should be built at that very location. So, I am having trouble understanding how you come up with demolishing the church in Mississippi.

I think in his twisted mind denying the killers the privilege of building a mosque to establish Muslim dominance over Western culture at ground zero is the same as demolishing a mosque that already exists.

I guess. It's sick and twisted, but I think that's it.

Grump is a sad, hateful little bigot. I'd like to say he grows on you with time, but except in the sense that a fungus or viral infection grows, it just isn't true.

Yep Muslims through their history have a propensity of building MOSQUES on conquered LANDS...

Hence the project's FIRST NAME of 'Cordoba'...

And the scumbags certainly built a Mosque in Cordoba, Spain after their conquest.

You cannot apply vicarious liability to one group and not to another, Missourian.

That is why I have said Revere puts himself into a pretzel shape.
