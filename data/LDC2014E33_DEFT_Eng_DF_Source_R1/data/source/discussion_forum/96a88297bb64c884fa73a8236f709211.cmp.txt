Who are you to talk? Can you come up with an objective approach? No, because you are too biased.

Meaning I shouldn't talk ?

Sorry, but you don't skate on this one.

And I certainly don't answer to you.

Any promise or objective can be set up correctly with measures.

As to weight, that depends on your point of view. But, Politifact holds no sway if people don't agree to the measures to begin with. And this isn't about dissing Politifact. They are simply reporting. But they report raw numbers and to allow you to hold those up as being meaningful would be a mistake on our part.

Do you want to support your statement that I am too biased. Or is this just a smokescreen because someone is calling you on your supposed "logical" approach.

You calling it useless without giving good reason why or coming up with an alternate source of analysis on his promises, makes you biased. The raw data speaks for itself. Obama has succeeded on most of his campaign promises.

I don't need an alternative to show you methodology to be flawed. And for someone who has critical thinker in his/her avatar, it is obvious you don't know what that means. And attempting to use it to prove bias is almost laughable. Well, actually it is laughable. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

There may not be a way to actually meaningfully measure his promises kept.

Raw data, espcially in this case, would need to be processed. Just looking at the numbers is meaningless.

Creating 5 million jobs huh? Want to cite that.

And investing in green tech. He has not invested a dime in green tech. What he has invested in is companies. Companies that are going to go with the status quo as long as they can sell it and are going to resist all efforts to push green tech any further than immediate profits.

This is the problem that I have with government 'investment' in technology. That investment should begin and end with straight out research grants that are awarded to people that are purely in it to push the technology. Companies do not need incentive for R&amp;D. they will do so as long as they can make a profit. In that regard, no matter how much you give them, it will not change their R&amp;D goals. On the other hand, the government must invest in technology because it is the ONLY entity that can invest billions pushing a tech to the next level and shrug the losses off. This is even more true in cases where no benefits are actually realized. See NASA for situations where government investment in technology has pushed the envelope. Investing in companies in the tech industry is NOT the place of government and does not end well.

Establishing an energy policy with Brazil does some good. Stopping American drilling does far more bad.

1. You dodged all but the first sentence of my post.

2. Your link does not substantiate your claim.

<quote>
Until the BLS completes these surveys, the exact number of newly created green jobs is open to debate. The Council of Economic Advisers -- which advises the president on economic matters --claims that 225,000 green jobs have been saved or created through the first nine months of 2010.

</quote>

Claims. Yes, THAT'S convincing verbiage.

<quote>
As of yet, there is simply not enough data to accurately gauge the progress in green job growth. Because of this, we continue to rate this promise as In the Works.

</quote>

225K is nowhere near a million. Even more so because it is essentially a guess. We also need to include the fact that the goal posts were moved from creating those jobs to now created OR saved. Heap that on top of the fact that the numbers of created or saved jobs has essentially been a farce through the economic downturn and you have nothing on that claim whatsoever.

</quote>

True, I was quoting Obama. However, I bet his estimate will come close. We will have to wait and see.

We are running out of the fuels we have. We need to invest in alternate forms of energy. Is gov involvement the best way to go? No, but it's a start. Energy companies arent going to do it.

I never said it was perfect. I just challenged you to come up with something better. For now, it is best source we have.
