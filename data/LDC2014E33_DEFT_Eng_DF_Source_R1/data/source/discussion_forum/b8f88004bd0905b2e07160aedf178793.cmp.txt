Obama claims that voter anger in Massachusettes (the FAIL of the health care bill) is because of George W Bush

bwahahahahahahaha

Do you fall for this?

Oh Massachusettes really showed President Bush!

And Obama was SO BUSY working for us..."that I think we lost some of that sense of speaking directly to the American people about what their core values are"

OH MY GOSH THATS IT!!!! I missed one of the 411 speeches and statements Obama made during the year...I didn't realize my core value to be a radical socialist!!!

Meanwhile the NAACP is trying to paint a happy face on socialism by saying Martin Luther King was a socialist

Unbelievable!

Okay so now who is falling for all this?

If only Hussein Obama weren't trying to brainwash kids into being Muslims in the schools, everything would be okay...

BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/rofl.gif"/>

Yep (proud defiance) and to think I didn't use a teleprompter or surround myself with marxists.

It must be hard to be a puppet for Soros.

Nah, that was Clinton <a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/shroder/040413">The Clinton and Islam partnership: Evidence of negotiations using America's public school children</a>

Obama is too busy making sure the terrorists escape being questioned about other plots...

Compared to Barry or all the marxist appointees he has working for him?
