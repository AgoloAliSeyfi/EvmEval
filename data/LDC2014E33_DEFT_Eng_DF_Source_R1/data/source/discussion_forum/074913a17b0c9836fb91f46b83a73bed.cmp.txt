lol. &lt; 5 year old msn chat <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/facepalm.gif" alt=":facepalm:"/> Sensitive subject again? No. At least I know I've been laid without feeling the need to broadcast the fact I got a girlfriend over the net. I picture you as being Will off the Inbetweeners - a briefcase ****er up his own ass.

And yeah I know those things because I have visited loads of uni's, and it doesn't take a genius to see the differences. But sure, keep telling yourself its all based on some guy with a clipboard.

All the league tables are based on someone with a clipboard going around taking an annual report of everything at that university and also you don't know what university is better until you've actually been lectured there or had an experience as a student there.

All the league tables are a load of rubbish. It entirely depends on how the students uses what he/she has at his/her disposal.

I also find it funny how you've said you've visited loads of universities - there are over 100 universities in the UK. Any normal person with a job wouldn't be able to visit many so therefore I take it your unemployed.

Hmm, it's strange anyone goes to the best unis. No idea why they're so competitive.

Because people want to be able to say "I went to Cambridge/Oxford" with a smug look on their face as if they are better than anyone else. No they really are not. they normally lack any form of social interaction and can not get on in the real world. I've employed Cambridge and Oxford graduates and they haven't a ****ing clue in IT to be honest. I don't know about other industries but they are extreme nerds that no employer really wants. An employer wants a normal person with the skills, not a freak of nature nerd who loves books and goes home every night to practice binary and hex.

And seriously, shut up about Sony. No one cares.

Well why think you know better when clearly I have experience in the sector. You may know more about another sector and that's fair enough. To say no one cares is speaking on behalf of everyone else which you do not have the right to do.

You're cute.

You're gay.

Read it again. I never said no-one likes you. I said there will be no people like you there.

No people like me. I know. I'm not a bookworm virgin. You enjoy your time at your posh university with all your yuppie colleagues - hope you do well and have a good time because when you come out and are scared in the real world because mummy and daddy are not around and you're a severe introvert due to having your head stuck in the book.

Basically like this.

I love how you are so smug and up your own ass - People in the real world will just put you in your place or **** you up on any occasion as you think you are always right when you are clearly not.

Enjoy your time with the privately educated posh tw@s you will meet there. Even better you probably are one. You'll fit right in <img src="images/smilies/wink.png"/>

Tell me how your democratic rights is being infringed by having a monarch, go on tell me...

The fact is the Prime Minister has all the de-facto power, he/she is the person giving the orders during times of crisis, he/she is the person who decides policy.

The Monarchy is an effective system of checks and balances and nothing more, it infringes on no one's right for democracy.

Oh and before someone jumps up and down and yells but we don't elect our head of state and so that's bad and we aren't free, Norway is frequently voted as the most democratic nation on Earth and guess what they have...yup a Monarch.

This was a disgraceful act of violence and would have been whether it was against a citizen or anyone else. What makes it more worrying is that this is the heir to the throne, that used to mean something....

The very fact that we have to pay them is enough to affect your rights. And what equality means.
You should look up the meaning of monarchy in the dictionary. Just that.
I don't care if people vote a country without knowing about it. If Norway is the most voted it does not mean that it is the most democratic. Of course it was an act of violence but it looks like the event of the day. Many people are attacked (and killed, and raped) everyday. So stop making polemic.
