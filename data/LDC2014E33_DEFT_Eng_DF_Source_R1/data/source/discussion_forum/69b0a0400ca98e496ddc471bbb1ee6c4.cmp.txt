That's what I'd expected.

You pro - life pricks could (almost) GIVE -a-fuck about anyone.....after they're BORN.....you sadistic, fuckin ' ASSHOLES !!!!

</quote>

Reminds me of a Robin Williams' routine where he basically talks about all the pro-life people and how they demand this and that, and how a baby deserves to be born. And then he says "and what does a pro-life person say when you go up to them with the off-spring of a crack-whore who has terminal AIDS?"

"Not our problem!"...

Bingo !!!

It's amazing the people who push this crap think if you aren't paying taxes to the gov't then no charitable acts wil ever take place.
The truth is that the govt is the least efficient method of distributing anything that might actually help people. But in general gov't programs increase poverty and dependence. Which is probably the idea.

The truth is that charities are the least efficient. On top of exorbitant salaries of some charity CEOs, they have high overhead and are feast or famine depending on contributions

Public charities are a nice stopgap but they are incapable of handling the volume that the government can.

No country on earth relies on public charities to handle all their public welfare

They are actually the most efficient, far more than the gov't, in part because they are there, while the gov't is in Washington.
The more bureaucrats run charities, the mroe people who need them. The more private sources run charities, the less people need them. Moral in there somewhere.

Private charities are much more inefficient than government. Most of their overhead is dedicated just to the act of raising money. Some charities spend as much as 90% just in fundraising expenses

What's the overhead for govt? I'll bet it is much higher than the AVERAGE (not some horror story) for charities.

Anyone who is a true follower of christ knows you give personally and from your own heart... not having it raped from you whether you have the calling to give it or not

And in a country based on freedom... you have the freedom to be a miserly prick too, even if ones like you don't like it and want to be generous with someone else's money

The issue is not which kind of 'charity' is most efficient, government or private. The issue is that government charity creates a class of poor who are never anything but poor, make their beds daily in their own misery, cannot see the opportunities that are out there for them in this great country, and have given up their freedom for a type of miserable security that no one would choose without having it foisted upon them.

Any government program or function has high overhead.
