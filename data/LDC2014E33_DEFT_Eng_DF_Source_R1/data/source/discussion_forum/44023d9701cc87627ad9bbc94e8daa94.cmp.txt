Once again you fucking MORON I have the meetings from the Japanese Government. They were never going to surrender to the allies before the A bombs and there were no deals to surrender to the Soviets as the Japanese did not believe they would attack them.

"This memo showed that the Japanese were offering surrender terms virtually identical to the ones ultimately accepted by the Americans at the formal surrender ceremony on September 2 -- that is, complete surrender of everything but the person of the Emperor."

Have you never realized the Potsdam Declaration was designed to inhibit Japan's surrender so the a-bombs could be used?

Mark Weber:
<a href="http://www.adl.org/holocaust/weber.asp">The Professional Denier</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

More than any other propagandist, Mark Weber, 45, embodies the Holocaust-denial movement. An articulate, media-savvy spokesperson with a master's degree in History from Indiana University, Weber got his start in the radical right in 1978, when he took the position of news editor for National Vanguard, a publication of the neo-Nazi National Alliance. In 1979, Weber also began to contribute regularly to The Spotlight, a weekly

tabloid produced by Willis Carto's Liberty Lobby organization. His involvement with the IHR also intensified steadily over the years; initially working as a contributor to the now-defunct IHR Newsletter, Weber began serving as emcee for the group's annual conventions in 1984. In 1985 he became a member of IHR's Editorial Advisory Committee and in 1992 he became editor of the Journal of Historical Review. Following IHR's break with Carto and the subsequent departure of most professional staff members in 1993, Weber became director of the organization with one professional staff person serving under him.

Ahh, yes.

Only those as hopelessly stupid as Curvey would use Weber as a resource. Maybe he has a National Enquirer Article he'd like to present with more credability? Perhaps some Alien in the form of Elvis has an opinion about Ethics and The A-Bomb that Curvey would like to share!! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Madeline, have you ever responded to the fact our top military leaders all agreed the bombs were not necessary?

</quote>

CurveLight, I am not the arbiter here. All USMB-ers get to have the same weight given their opinions. I'm just asking questions because I'm dumbfounded that there is (apparently) disagreement as to the historical facts.

It is an indisputable historical fact that the top US military leaders agreed the bombs were not necessary.

What do you think about that fact? I'm beginning to doubt the sincerity of your OP since you have side stepped this at least 4 times.

You have no leg to stand on. Japan NEVER made an attempt to surrender before the Atomic Bombs. The only thing they did is offer through the Soviets to a cease fire and a return to pre war borders. They would vacate all captured territory that had from after Dec 1941 and we would evacuate all Japanese territory captured that was owned by them prior to Dec 1941. That is the ONLY offer made.
