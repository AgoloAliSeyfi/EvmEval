The question of the bombs' role was not in trying to figure out how to end WW2. They were used to figure out how to start what became known as The Cold War.

Oh yeah, that makes a lot of sense...... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_whistle.gif"/>

You could not think of any better way to demonstrate what an idiot you are.

You're one of many who lack basic knowledge about the end of WW2. The bombs were used to prevent Japan from surrendering through a deal with Russia. Why? The US would have had to share the spoils of war and we were not about to do that. Also, we were never really allies with Russia as our only common goal was defeating the third Reich in Europe.

But feel free to continue calling people an idiot because they say something beyond your comprehension capabilities. It makes you look oh so cool!

Once again you fucking MORON I have the meetings from the Japanese Government. They were never going to surrender to the allies before the A bombs and there were no deals to surrender to the Soviets as the Japanese did not believe they would attack them.

No to all those questions. He even uses magic intercepts for his claims. He is twisting the information and in some cases outright lying.

But what is the point if you refuse to even read the documents?

</quote>

I have glanced through all the URLs, sir. Each seems to support the factual allegations the posters have claimed they would. But BOTH scenarios cannot have occurred, and at this point, I am kinda sorta thinking this is as far as I'm gonna get.

I'm heavily inclined to believe what you have posted, RetiredGySgt, but I still have some doubts. More or less the same place I was in when this thread started.

</quote>

The info they are pointing to is an incomplete picture.

In many ways, what you are saying about both scenarios being impossible to co-exist is exactly what was taking place. There was the "official" position that the nukes were the only way to force japan to an unconditional surrender then there was the more factual position that japan was trying to surrender.

In both countries there was a power struggle between the military and civilian leadership, but their agendas were in role reversals. In Japan the civilian side was more apt to seeking peace than the military but in the US it was the military that was pushing for peace more than the civilian leadership under Truman.

In regards to your OP question about the "necessity" of the bombs, what does it tell you that every top US military leader has agreed that the bombs were not necessary?

</quote>

And yet you IGNORE the fact that until the second Atomic Bomb was dropped the Japanese had NO INTENTION of surrendering and even after the second attack it took direct intervention from the Emperor to force the Army to surrender.

Once again pea brain the Japanese never offered to surrender. The offer to the Soviets to intercede for them with the allies was NOT a surrender. And after the first bomb they made no credible offer either. I have the FACTS to back me up. The meetings of the Japanese Government.
