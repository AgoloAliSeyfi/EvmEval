The Lisbon Treaty is vital for the EU to continue in its being, it holds the fundamentals for accession of croatia, FYROM and any other states wanting to join, the limit of nations is currently met and Lisbon expands that limit to encompass more European nations.
Plus the older treaties, Maastricht etc made it possible to handle the paperwork and legislation of 15 member states, THE EU IS UNDEMOCRATIC because it cannot function without further legislation to handle 27 member states. The LT has the legislatory application to properly handle all member states easier, upto i think 35 states. As for the heavy bureacracy, this has grown quite a abit due to there not being legislation to ease the handling of 27member states, but when the EU was formed over the long period of time since the 40s it was agreed that this was needed to make the EU unaccessible to extremist parties in the EU parliament(its worked so far).
Most people complaining about the EU are brits like me, and we dont fully benefit from the EU because we have/ conservative and labour governments who pay the membership fee but dont reap the benefits, like the Schengen Zone, the Euro all the good stuff, we dont benefit from the removal of borders because we never had immediate wars over borders because of the english channel but imagine how it must feel to be a belgian or a german or a frank, to think you never be invaded by another european again. Social Charters etc and lots more, but our govts have chosen to opt-out of those goodies to please the Right. As for money being distributed into bottomless pits...Well unless im blind, has not the EU built and started upgrading the MOST ADVANCED research facility in Europe on British soil? How many Schools have been built with European Funds, a lot more than you think, mine, our rival, the one north of the river and thats just peterborough. The money goes into fundamental science, the European Space Programme, helping new member states with their economies (polish economy is booming now, and look, the immigrants are starting to go home, all because of EU money to boost their economy and free trade etc.
Without the EU we would struggle financially due to tariffs etc with our euro neighbours. And all this cant work without the Lisbon treaty or a similar restructuring of the Union or legislation...

Still not many people on here have actually read the Treaty cover to cover..(i have) and it doesnt resemble the constitution at all, it made hard reading thats for sure..

As far as i can see Europes doing a great job protecting peace which is what is developed for.
Oh and about the leaders, We do elect them. Through MEP elections, as for electing the President that was in the constitution but that got sacked. The commision has representatives from every country and Barroso himself doesnt hold much power anyway but i do think there should be a more democratic system in place for that, but if it was democratised then we'd pick the person with the cute face with no experience so its fine the way it is.

All well and good but the majority of the British public do not want the European Union in existence. It doesnt serve our purpose and if we ever were actually given a say on a real European Issue, this country would categorically tell it where to go.

Get on with your pathetic Lisbon treaties etc and leave us out.

Or a Parliamentary report set up by Mps from different parties <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKL2046388420080120">http://uk.reuters.com/article/topNew...46388420080120</a>

Or Angela Merkel claiming its the same in "substance". The pro - European Union argument is really falling to shreds, I was waiting for one of you to come and defend the indefensable.

No, they do share my views: it is substantially the same: the same reforms are retained. However it was not substance which made it a constitution and it was not due to its substance that it was given a referendum.

I love the left, so much for democracy, when we wanted a say the Labour Party said absolutely No! Maybe they knew what the result would be?
</quote>

Well, I am right wing and I'm a Conservative, and quite simply I say 'no referendums' - I don't see the point in them, and I don't want them. Whilst I can see what Labour was trying to do by having a referendum on the EU Constitutional Treaty, I don't particularly think those reasons remain any more in the Lisbon Treaty.

That's not true, and even if it was I don't see why it should be decisive in answering the issue.
