Chief Wiggum's post x 1000.

This thread should be a real wakeup call to guys. Even if it is a troll thread. This happens. You can be as careful as possible, but if the condom breaks and she's not taking the pill, she can decide to keep that baby, and you have absolutely zero say in the matter. That is completely BS. Yes both parties were responsibe, but ultimately, the power lies with the woman.

Unfortunately every day Children are born into the world by irresponsible, poor parents who can barely take care of themselves. Nobody thinks ahead. Who's going to pay for the baby? Who's going to buy food? Clothes? Before you know it the 'baby' will need school books, school costs, trips, he or she may want to take up a sport or play an instrument. I see far too many kids miss out on even some of the most basic things because of their moron unprepared parents. Parents greatly underestimate the costs. It adds up fast. Yes people find 'ways' to deal with it, but is that healthy for a child? Just scraping by? Living on the bare minumum wages, and or government support, family support and child support?

You can wave your moral flags all you like in regards to abortion, but the way I see it, willingly bringing a child into the world when you really know you're not prepared or financially secure is, in my mind completely wrong. Disgusting.

I agree with you - situations of this sort are very common these days and guys AND girls ought to take a lesson out of it.

I don't know why some posts on here assume this is a troll though! Why would someone just want to make up a whole scenario just for the fun of it (+ she didn't post anonymously). Poor Girl.

I'm scared as to how he might react and it's been 4 weeks and I've still not found the perfect moment to tell him.
Also I'm afraid what if he doesn't want to keep it when I really do. Although he's a couple of year older than me (19), he can act really immature, aggressive, and violent at time.
My parents have come to terms with it now after having little mini heart attacks, it's just how can I break it to him?
