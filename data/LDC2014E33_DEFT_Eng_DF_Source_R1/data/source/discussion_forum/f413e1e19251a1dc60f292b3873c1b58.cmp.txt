I've been watching the rallies and all the anti-beck rally people were WAY off base with their assumptions.

Its not even politicial. It actually is about some principles and celebrating those such as Faith, Honor, and Charity.

Some of you truly are just lost individuals who have nothing but hate and are so blinded by that hate that you can't see something when its right in front of you. All you see is "Evil Beck" and make yourselves out to be very petty individuals for attacking him when he is actually sending out a good message at this particular rally.

I pray that you can all get over your hate and celebrate the principles of equality, faith in each other and something greater than ourselves, hope that we can all come together across political lines in the name of charity, and love for our fellow citizens that this rally has been honoring for the last 45 min that i've watched it on facebook.

One can only imagine the screaming protests if Keith Olbermann had rallied the country in the name of honor.

Restoring Honor means? It suggests that honor was taken, if honor can be taken, who took it?

Seems to me, and I only watched a short time, this was another in a series of events where uber-patriotism and God are used to appeal to the emotions of the people. It reminded me of this well known remark, ' When fascism comes to America it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.

Of course I'm not suggesting Beck or those who organized today's event or past 'tea parties' are fascists, but they do put on events based solely on emotion which appeal to those who seem to want to hear simple solutions to complex and myraid problems.

Though the stage included a bit of diversity, when the camera pans the crowd there were only white people in view, and most appeared well fed and dressed in middle-class attire.

based on that statement, would you say george washington was a fascist?

Glen Beck is no George Wasington. BTW, are you dishonest, or have reading comprehension problems?

Here comes Alveda. The "token" King.

Hilarious. I don't think Glennie would appreciate your comment. He seems to think she's One of You. Are you admitting she's just a token speaker? Do you think Glennie paid her?

</quote>

no asswipe, you fucktard friend bodecca called her a "token"

</quote>

Well, shiite, why didn't you just say so? Sorry, sweetheart, but most of us don't read the thousands of postings every day in order to pluck out exactly the one you're referring to. But hey, my bad. It's not like you ever have anything bad to say about black people, so we all assume you just love Alveda too.
