i think the crux of the debate is people understanding that contraception (as provided by health care providers) will not "free." it will be included in the cost of your original premium. thus they can not charge an extra co pay or fee for. there are other services this applies to as well, such as mammograms. now... should all men who pay premiums demand that women pay for their own mammograms since 99% of men do not get them?

the way health (and really all) insurance works is that you pay a premium for access to services. when you pay your premium and do not receive any services, you area subsidizing someone else's services. so every month i pay premiums, i help to pay for some guys viagra, or some womans pap smear, or some kids physical. should i be raising hell that they should be paying for those services themselves? but your insurance contract will not allow for that. call your insurance company and demand that none of your premium dollars be used for any services or treatment you disagree with and see what happens.

Take a pill so you can fuck your brains out is not the same thing as getting a mammogram to see if you have cancer.

Don't be fucking retarded.

The crux of the debate is that the State went into a Church and directed them to do something against their faith.

You get all hot and bothered when that same State invades your bedroom. It is very revealing of your two-facedness you don't mind it invading a Church.

although you can take that same pill to control acne and hormone levels as well. not all women use the pill as a pregnancy prevention device.

Weak. You are shameless. Holding up a few people with medical problems as human shields so everyone else can get their fuck-at-will pill.

Alcohol is used in medicines. Therefore, because of this sick guy over here who can't afford his medicine, Congress should make colleges pay for students to get free liquor.

That is the kind of logic you are using, and the kind of logic Ms. Fluke used.

How about we just help actual sick people instead? My god! That might actually help keep health care costs down!

Can't have that!

As said by many, if you can't afford a dollar for a condom, you have two choices. 1) keep it in your pants or 2) keep your legs closed... Depending on you sex.

To force a church to go against its beliefs just so some poor fool can have sex without danger of getting a girl pregnant makes so little sense I can't believe people here are even defending it. The redirect to world poverty... Water shortages... The church.... Not a single word said about the idiocy of someone that poor thinking about mating.

If you want to take away religious freedoms, you better come up with a better plan then 'but I can't afford a $1 condom'

maybe churchs shouldnt operate hospitals then. if they have a problem with performing or providing certain services that are part of that business model, then maybe they shouldnt be in that business to begin with.

why would an intelligent person get involved in a business in which parts of it could violate their beliefs? that would be like a devout muslim opening a liquor store but refusing to sell booze.

So, you support taking away religious liberty. Nice. Idiot.

I'm sorry, but how does providing abortions equate with healing the sick in a Catholic hospital? I know of grocery stores who won't sell tobacco. It's their choice as to what services they will provide and what they won't. At least it is in a free society.
