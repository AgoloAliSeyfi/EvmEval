I wouldn't give a card or anything but maybe ask her out but ask her if she wants to go out for coffee the next day (so you're asking on valentines day but no pressure of it being on valentines day). Either way, best of luck <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

Pick your moment. Most of them will wander away if you get her to start talking to you. It's a natural thing. Or you could ask to talk to her for a minute - but that could be awkward.

I would ask her on Thursday or Friday if she fancies going for a coffee/ drink at the weekend. It might be easier to tell her that you like her when aren't at uni (but I'm sure she'd know anyway if you ask her out).

If she is very girlish, likes Disney, and romcom's, Valentine's day would be good. Make a rough judgement on whether she would like it and just go with your instinct <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

Just be casual, ask if she fancies grabbing a coffee or something to eat after/between lectures. If she's with her friends you could just ask to have a word with her, or try and sit next to her in your lecture and ask her there. Good luck <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.png"/>

It also helps to strike up a casual conversation before asking, instead of outright asking. It will flow better.

update isn't very good, I thought i'd let the whole valentines thing cool down and i normally see her on thursday but she wasn't there, even on friday, she might be ill. An epic fail, I see her on monday and it will have to wait till then <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/> This is turning into a soap opera, problem is on mondays she sits with her mates i don't have the courage to say something in front of them all. I'm just going to have to say ' can i have a word' or sit next to her. I was all hyped up for last week now my energys gone, i'm tired of waiting. I don't care what happens, i'm just gonner tell her on monday. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/eek.gif" alt=":eek:"/>

If she says no, she clearly wasn't as wonderful as previously believed - so no harm done, you've evaded a date with a not-so-wonderful girl. If she says yes, then woo!
