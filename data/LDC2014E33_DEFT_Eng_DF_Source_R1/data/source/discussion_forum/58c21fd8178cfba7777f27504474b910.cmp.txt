What kind of work do you do?

</quote>

I was application support for trading and market data systems. I also helped build out NOCs, RNOCs, contigency floors and data centers. I was the SME for a proprietary application that we sold to customers. Before that I did consulting for application and hardware migrations. I have admin level experience with HPUX, SUSE, and RHEL. Applications and OS's that I am familiar with include TIDAL/BIG BROTHER/HP Openview/TANDEM NonStop/Remedy/Service Now/Tripwire/Perforce. I've trained ITIL v1, v2 and v3. I can write PERL/KSH scripts and use SQL. And I just completed a CCNA class...so I am studying to take the certification test. That..and I make a really mean omlette! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

Well...for starters.....If you look anything like your avatar, I think I may know what your problem is and why you cant find a job. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_whistle.gif"/>

I just copied and pasted your qulifications on a word doc. I am going to make some calls to people I kow that do tech and see if your qualificatiuons are something they may be able to present to a client.

If I get any positive repsonse, I will PM you...and do something I am very much against doing...but would do iot for you....give you my personal/business information.

And if I do...just an fyi...I have a very vicious puggle guarding my house.

It's no "bubble". The world comes to the United States to educate it's people.

The United States Colleges and Universities are top flight..bar none.

OMG....there is no way you just denied that education is a bubble market right now. You didn't.

Wow.

I suppose you can call anything a bubble if you like..and point to things to support your point.

My understanding of a "bubble" is a sector that is artificial propped up..despite weak demand. Like the "Housing" bubble at the beginning of the Bush administration.

There is Strong demand for US education. And that's world wide.

Low cost loans, credit not a problem. Try thinking beyond that. Add state government increasing funding to buy votes. One Result is higher tuition. But those teachers deserve all that money and perks on the tax payer dime right?
