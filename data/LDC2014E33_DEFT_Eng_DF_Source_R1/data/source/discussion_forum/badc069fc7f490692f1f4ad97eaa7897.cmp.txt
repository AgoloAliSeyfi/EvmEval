Unlike partisan boobs I don't discount what's said simply because of the network, newspaper, or website it was said on. Lawrence O'Donnell is certainly no fan of Ron Paul, but did his job and debunked a false story.

Kook, insurance companies will rebuild a home, but they cannot turn on the electricity, shelter people, keep law and order, when a town has been destroyed.

You are so fucking stupid.

Obamacare is not the same as the Feds propping a city back on its feet. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/> You kooks think any help by the Feds is illegal.

I hope you lose your home....that would be justice.

I wish there was a way for kooks like you to be tagged so that we could quit protecting you from terrorists and not help you during natural disasters.

When you whine about the US military killing terrorists overseas, we could just single you out here for terrorists to find you while leaving us alone, because "you don't like your tax dollars killing terrorists overseas."

Also, we can just tag you and your personal goods for not being supported when a natural disaster hits your trailer. The Feds will just say, he didn't want us to find him a place to sleep after the tornado sent his trailer airborn.

What's the difference between wanting you to be taxed more in order to pay someone else's home insurance costs and wanting you to be taxed more in order to pay for Obamacare?

If millions have a disastrous medical issue, like cancer, or hundreds or thousands have a natural disaster issue, what's the difference? Shouldn't your "principles" lead you to support Obamacare?

If people need help, just assume charity and local gov'ts aren't enough and just tax everyone else to pay for it, what's the difference?

Well aren't you just a paragon of class? I notice you have nothing to say about your little airplane story being debunked.

IMO we (Americans) are all in this together. As individuals we cannot do enough to mitigate the misery of our fellow countrymen when disaster strikes. This ideology, Libertarianism, seems little different than the ideas expressed by Utopian Socialists more than a century ago. They are nice in theory, but reality will always get in the way.

Let my tax dollars be used to help other Americans in need, and anyone - business or individuals - who hope to profit from the misery of others are no different than looters and should be treated as such.

Yes, very little different from the Utopian Socialists. We even think think if our ideas are implemented there will be "anti-lions" that you'll be able to ride around on.
