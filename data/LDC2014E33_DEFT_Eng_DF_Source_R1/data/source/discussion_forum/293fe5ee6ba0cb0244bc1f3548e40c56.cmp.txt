I agree about the communal locker room thing- it probably does help ingrain that women come in all shapes and sizes. Although after I get done swimming and go to shower and there are kids in the locker room I get really uncomfortable when they look at you so I usually try to cover up a bit!
Growing up I never saw my Dad naked but he NEVER EVER wore a shirt, even while driving. I think he would have gone w/o out bottoms too if it weren't for me and my sister. I know for sure that he swims laps at his house ( he lives in the middle of nowhere) in the nude, *shutters*
My mom and my sisters were naked all the time growing up, I think it's perfectly normal. Even as we got older, 14+, if we had friends over it was not uncommon for my sister and mom to be walking around in bra and undies.
My DH and I don't have kids so we walk around naked all the time. Example my husband just walked in the door way butt naked as I was writing this.

I never saw my dad naked, barely even bare legged (w/shorts on). My mom would walk nude from the bathroom to her bedroom after a shower. It wasn't really a big deal.

I've never seen either of my parents nude. When I was young, I can recall my mom changing her bra/shirt in front of me so I have seen her bare chest. I can't recall how young I was the last time she changed in front of me, but I *think* it was probably elementary school.

I think I saw them both naked but I don't recall it being a normal thing - I think it was on accident. My mom more than my dad but I distinctly remember that I did see him at least once as a younger kid.
I personally think once a child is old enough to remember it as an adult, it is time to try to have clothes on when you're around your kid. I don't see this being an issue in my house, I usually do my makeup naked so it doesn't get on my clothes, but other than that neither of us walk around naked much even without kids.

I saw my mom naked all the time. She always walked around naked in the morning and slept in the nude.
I have also seen FIL in his underwear. He was just walking around like it was no big deal. It was awful. &lt;shudder&gt;

I accidentally saw my dad naked from behind once, and my mom with no bra on another time. But my parents would not have been the kind to be casually naked or partially naked around us kids. I was not either, with my kids; and now, at their ages, I think we would all turn to stone if there was any accidental nudity.

My mom, sisters &amp; I change in front of each other when we're all in the same house so it's NBD. My dad I've seen on accident a few times. My parents have no issues changing in front of my sisters or me.
H has been uncomfortable/embarrassed/startled that my sisters see nothing wrong with running around the house in underwear/towels.
H's family I'm sure haven't seen each other without clothes on since he was preschool or younger. They are very modest.
