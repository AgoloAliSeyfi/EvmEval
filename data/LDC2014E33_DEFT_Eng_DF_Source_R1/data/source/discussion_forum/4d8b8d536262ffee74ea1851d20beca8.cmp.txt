sometime rights come into conflict and they need to be resolved. in this case it is the freedom of choice vs. the freedom of religion. the courts will have a difficult time deciding this one. if you rule for freedom of religion, you trample someones right, but if you rule for freedom of choice, you trample someone elses rights.

its a double edged sword.
as cruel as it sound, i would argue freedom of choice wins out on this fact and this alone. the US is a secular society and not everyone believe in or follow religion. now people are still free to choose which religion to follow, but (in this case) ruling in favor or religion would in effect make those of us who do not adhere to that religion forced to follow part of its doctrine.

opinions?

But dont you get it?

The GOP is fighting for freedom of choice.

They are fighting the idea that goivernment has the right to mandate that an insuirance company MUST sell a service...even if they dont want to.

Ironically....they are fightiong for freedom of choice.

Freedom of religion started iut...yes....but Obamas "compromise" was to minimize freedom of choice for the insurance companies.

So now it is a fight for freedom of choice.

the left is fighting for freedom of choice.

you have it backwards.

the GOP is fighting on the basis of religious institutions. where in the discussion has kaiser, united health care or blue cross / blue shield come up?

No sir. You have it wrong.

It started as freedom of religion when the Catholic Church complained.

Obama agreed and compromised.

However, the compromise meant that insurance companies can be told by government that they MUST offer something, even if it goes against their morals.

When has ANY business been told they MUST offer a service?

It is about freedom of choice.

The left wants the people to get BC form any insurance company they want to......at the cost of freedom of choiuce for the owners of the insurance companies.

The right wants the inmsurance companies to ALSO have freedom of choice....so sell it if you want...dont if you dont want to....take insurance with one that offers it or take insurance with one thayt doesnt.

Freedom of choice is swecured for both sides the GOP way....freedom of choice is eliminated for owners of insurance companies the left way.

I'm sorry, but how does providing abortions equate with healing the sick in a Catholic hospital? I know of grocery stores who won't sell tobacco. It's their choice as to what services they will provide and what they won't. At least it is in a free society.

i dont see where providing free abortions is part of this discussion

</quote>

What? Do you see the word free in regard to abortions in my post you responded to? Me either? I did mention a "free" society, which means free of government forcing you to provide services you choose not to.

</quote>

providing abortions for free are not part of this discussion. unless somehow in your twisted mine the pill is equal to an abortion

no matter how much you keep telling yourself that, its not the essence of the debate.

show me where the health insurance companies are coming together to protest the contraception mandate.

they are not, it is the church and religious institutions involved in health care.

i didnt know they church sold insurance now? this is news to us all....

you do realize that there is a difference between an insurance company and a health care provider right?
