Actually, the whole "contraception" drum is being pounded by the liberals in an attempt at gotcha politics. If one were being honest, they would know this is about constitutional freedoms rather than denying women "health care". But that is if one is being honest.

sometime rights come into conflict and they need to be resolved. in this case it is the freedom of choice vs. the freedom of religion. the courts will have a difficult time deciding this one. if you rule for freedom of religion, you trample someones right, but if you rule for freedom of choice, you trample someone elses rights.

its a double edged sword.
as cruel as it sound, i would argue freedom of choice wins out on this fact and this alone. the US is a secular society and not everyone believe in or follow religion. now people are still free to choose which religion to follow, but (in this case) ruling in favor or religion would in effect make those of us who do not adhere to that religion forced to follow part of its doctrine.

opinions?

But dont you get it?

The GOP is fighting for freedom of choice.

They are fighting the idea that goivernment has the right to mandate that an insuirance company MUST sell a service...even if they dont want to.

Ironically....they are fightiong for freedom of choice.

Freedom of religion started iut...yes....but Obamas "compromise" was to minimize freedom of choice for the insurance companies.

So now it is a fight for freedom of choice.

the left is fighting for freedom of choice.

you have it backwards.

the GOP is fighting on the basis of religious institutions. where in the discussion has kaiser, united health care or blue cross / blue shield come up?
they havent raised any moral issues or issues of any kind with having to provide contraception at no additional cost.

As said by many, if you can't afford a dollar for a condom, you have two choices. 1) keep it in your pants or 2) keep your legs closed... Depending on you sex.

To force a church to go against its beliefs just so some poor fool can have sex without danger of getting a girl pregnant makes so little sense I can't believe people here are even defending it. The redirect to world poverty... Water shortages... The church.... Not a single word said about the idiocy of someone that poor thinking about mating.

If you want to take away religious freedoms, you better come up with a better plan then 'but I can't afford a $1 condom'

maybe churchs shouldnt operate hospitals then. if they have a problem with performing or providing certain services that are part of that business model, then maybe they shouldnt be in that business to begin with.

why would an intelligent person get involved in a business in which parts of it could violate their beliefs? that would be like a devout muslim opening a liquor store but refusing to sell booze.

</quote>

So, you support taking away religious liberty. Nice. Idiot.

Do you and others believe the couple were unjustly found guilty and should not have been sent to prison? Why is an abortion taking a life and praying over a dying infant and not calling 911 an exercise of religous freedom?

I'm sorry, but how does providing abortions equate with healing the sick in a Catholic hospital? I know of grocery stores who won't sell tobacco. It's their choice as to what services they will provide and what they won't. At least it is in a free society.

</quote>

i dont see where providing free abortions is part of this discussion

</quote>

What? Do you see the word free in regard to abortions in my post you responded to? Me either? I did mention a "free" society, which means free of government forcing you to provide services you choose not to.

You are aware of course of all of the charitable work the Catholic church does in each of the areas you mention aren't you?

</quote>

Wry has pretty much already told me in this thread that doing things charitably is meaningless, it has to be done by gov't.

The cathlic church could cure cancer and hand out the cure for free, but if there's no gov't mandate involved, Wry wouldn't support it.

</quote>

LOL, we both know you're full of shit, that said, when you grow up your opinions will change.

</quote>

I've already asked and you've clarified it. Even if you're the most giving person to charity, unless you support gov't mandates, you aren't charitable.

I'm doubting as I grow up I'll become a partisan hack. I realized both parties were shit in my teens, it's shocking to me that others haven't. Partisan blinders always conquer common sense.
