There seemed to be some confused lot of Muslim girls who claim to be too religious and yet don't wear hear scarves and the other day there was one Pakistani girl who on CNN tried to prove that she was a devout Muslim and it was not mandatory in Islam and not mentioned in Quran that Muslim girls are supposed to wear hijab.

I am not judging any body here but if you are not serious about Islam why do you need to claim to be.

because no where in the qu'ran does it say they should wear the hijab as that musim girl said it's not mandatory. it just said woman should dress modistly so not like sluts

I don't wear a headscarf but I don't go around giving Islam a bad reputation. there are many girls with hijab who do a lot of âharamâ things! Some of them don't even want to wear it, but they have to because of family pressure etc. I personally don't think I'm ready to wear a headscarf and I don't want be one of those girls who wear it on and off. they go clubbing and think it's ok to take off their scarf for one night!

same here.
I started wearing the hijab when i felt i was ready for it and i believed that what i was doing was right which is why i was doing it - not because of pressure
but there were lots of girls that i knew that wore hijab one day just for the sake off it and another day wore mini skirt because they wanted to look good for their boyfriends - these type of people annoy me

i havent got time to answer everything but i saw these and knew they were taken out of context lol, ill just go for the inheritance one....
the Quran says it is the males responsibility to look after the family, one can then argue if its fair or not to have that responsibility put on you!....but because of that responsibility he will receive that wealth amount. looking more into the website you took it from it says :

"This Islamic law is regressive. In the US, for example, inheritance is divided equally among all siblings, regardless of the gender. No religious law prohibits this from happening "

but the jeiwsh law on inheritance says : if a man dies, his possessions are divided by his sons. His wife can either take her Ketubah or can live off her husband's estate for as long as she wishes.
# If there is a firstborn son, he receives a double portion.
# The daughters are supported off their father's estate until they get married.
if no sons then it gets passed to daughters.

i doubt the rest of the explanations on the website now <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/>

I don't agree with the man being 'head of the household', and describing women as men's fields seems pretty explicit to me. I'm not an advocate of Judaism, and I think it's important that people recognise that some Islamic laws are very regressive, therefore it's okay to pick and choose.

Hijab is fardh (obligatory), there is no difference of opinion amongst the scholars on this issue. Only secular so-called muslims attempt to spread confusion over the issue of the hijab.

Islam is supposed to be followed as a whole, not pick and choose the teachings and modify the religion according to you. Just don't follow it at all then.
