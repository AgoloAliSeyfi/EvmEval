I'm having trouble with you analogy.

No one is saying an existing mosque should be demolished. The debate is whether or not a new mosque should be built at that very location. So, I am having trouble understanding how you come up with demolishing the church in Mississippi.

I think in his twisted mind denying the killers the privilege of building a mosque to establish Muslim dominance over Western culture at ground zero is the same as demolishing a mosque that already exists.

I guess. It's sick and twisted, but I think that's it.

Grump is a sad, hateful little bigot. I'd like to say he grows on you with time, but except in the sense that a fungus or viral infection grows, it just isn't true.

Yep Muslims through their history have a propensity of building MOSQUES on conquered LANDS...

Hence the project's FIRST NAME of 'Cordoba'...

And the scumbags certainly built a Mosque in Cordoba, Spain after their conquest.

In what? 900 A.D.?

I guess you aren't aware of the history of christianity in the UK, or in California?

Okay, let me see if I can explain, Missourian.

For the days since the terrible shooting in Arizona, Revere and I have been arguing. I have said the violent rhetoric should be foreclosed, and he has said I am undercutting free speech. He does not at all agree that an atmosphere of such speech may make such tragedies likely to recur.

"Only the shooter is responsible", he keeps saying.

But in the case of the Park 51 Mosque, he seems to do a complete backflip. Now ALL American Muslims, all mosques, are somehow responsible for 9/11. Now, a tenuous connection (that only exists if you agree with his beliefs about the role of religion in that tragedy, and I do not) between those who commit a crime and those whose speech MAY support their ideas (and other premise I'm not buying) should be used to foreclose freedom of religion.

Consistency is not exactly Revere's hallmark here.

He still makes a good point...one I've made myself.

I have as yet to meet a Muslim I didn't like.

And even tho Sunni Man and I often disagree, I like him personally.

But I still oppose the GZ Mosque for the exact reason Revere put forward.

Just like I would oppose a Shinto Shrine built at Pearl Harbor during WWII or a Glock outlet opening next to the Safeway in Tuscon next month.

When Muslim extremist are no longer plotting to kill us, we can revisit the subject.

You cannot apply vicarious liability to one group and not to another, Missourian.

That is why I have said Revere puts himself into a pretzel shape.

Wouldn't you expect them to build mosques in their own territories? They controlled Spain for quite awhile back then. I'm sure there were plenty of Christian churches built during and shortly after the various Crusades in what had formally been Muslim territories.

The Muslim Community Center in NYC that has been termed the Ground Zero Mosque is not a monument of Muslim victory but rather a place of worship that American Muslims would like to build and according to our own Constitution they have the right to build it if they own the property.

I still feel that it would be disrespectful to build on ground zero.
