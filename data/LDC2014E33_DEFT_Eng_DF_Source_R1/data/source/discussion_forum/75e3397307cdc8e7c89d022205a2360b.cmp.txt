His over-reliance on diplomacy with Republicans has been costly for critical progress. That being said, I do think he is a good president Let me explain why I didn't choose the other options:

1) I think Obama shares the blame a little on the slow recovery of the economy, but I think there are many factors to be considered (i.e., congress)

2) I think his foreign policy has been great

3) Despite Solyndra, his energy policy has been quite successful

4) It was Bush that supercharged the defict (although some of the blame does go to Obama, too)

5) His taxation policy would have been great had it not been for what I chose out of this poll

6) National Security has undoubtedly been his best work (even Fox News can admit that).

Please explain your choice.

His foreign policy has been abysmal.

Today, thanks to Obama, we're leaving Iraq in shame. The troops are just glad to be leaving, but everyone knows Obama intentionally screwed the pooch there.

Nobody likes us. At one time everyone thought that Bush was hated, but Obama has taken hatred of America to a new level.

It's time we got this childish OWS out of the White House and put somebody responsible back at the helm.

You have absolutely no perspective whatsoever. For one thing, polls show most Americans (including most Republicans) agree that ending the war in Iraq was a good idea.

No he hasnt.

He has never publically supported the OWS.

He's been a weak leader who has divided this country.

He is like a liberal Bush.
