So, I got an e-mail back from Jack Layton (Leader of the NDP) today.

Thank you for your past email concerning a trade deal between the EU and Canada.

New Democrats share the concerns voiced by the Council of Canadians over any trade deal that is negotiated in secrete. We firmly believe that all trade deals must come before Parliament for a full review and vote.

Another issue closely related is the Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP). New Democrats have spoken out against the SPP from the beginning, and when these talks picked up pace in 2007, we launched a national campaign to expose the SPP. You can read background information on the SPP negotiations at: <a href="http://archive.ndp.ca/page/5614">http://archive.ndp.ca/page/5614</a> and <a href="http://archive.ndp.ca/stopthespp">http://archive.ndp.ca/stopthespp</a>.

Highlights from Jack Layton and his team of New Democrats' plan include:

- Ceasing Canadian participation in the Liberal and Conservative-driven Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP).
- Increasing diplomatic efforts, particularly in light of recent comments by the United States and Russia, to ensure that other countries respect our Arctic sovereignty.
- Transferring the Canadian Coast Guard to the Department of Public Safety and increase resources to improve its operational effectiveness, including initiatives that will better protect and strengthen our sovereignty over Canadian waters.
- Stopping the hollowing out of Canadian industries by strengthening the Investment Canada Act. Foreign takeovers of Canadian companies will be subject to more stringent tests respecting job protection and creation, head office location, and the promotion of research and development in Canada.
- Creating an economic development agency for the North.

The commitments we are putting before the people of Canada in this election are about hope and opportunity for you, your family, your friends, and neighbours. They are about a future where you come first.

We are committed to balanced budgets each and every year. Our full platform of commitments, with costing, can be found by visiting: <a href="http://www.ndp.ca/platform">http://www.ndp.ca/platform</a>. Feel free to pass along our email to anyone who may be interested.

Again, we appreciate your desire for a sovereign Canada. Together, we can make it happen by voting for Jack Layton and his team of New Democrats on October 14th!

Sincerely,

Jack Layton and Canada's New Democrats

Jack Layton's New Democrats
Putting you and your family first.

Well, I'm a little encouraged. I mean, even during a federal Election in less than 48 Hours over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, and someone took the time to e-mail me back this morning.

What a pleasant surprise.

That is pretty cool.

But I'm sorry to say I don't really take the NDP seriously. They are a permanent opposition party promoting old school left wing economics which they have no need to update since they have no chance of getting elected. Of course they oppose SPP, they oppose free trade and everything that has anything to do with it.

Well it's heartening that Canadians seem to be aware of the SPP existence, and it's importance here in the States voters are unaware mostly, and candidates for our presidency are never ask about it.

*shrugs* They have a chance at getting elected just as much as the next party. I mean, hey. Where would healthcare be without the NDP? And besides they do update their platform.

Don't be such a Debbie Downer, Hip. <img src="images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/>

What Hiptastic believes free trade to be is not free trade at all. It's heavily managed and regulated trade designed to erode sovereignty and establish international laws and regulations. That is the real purpose behind so-called "free trade."

Arguably it isn't free trade, and yeah it is an entrenched and intricate system, but there are many aspects of trade that remain unregulated and unchecked that do pose a threat to exploiting goods and people all throughout the linear system of industry and in turn the way that trade works at a global scale it creates an externalized cost and a deflated cost for what things are worth.

It purposefully puts items into a bubble, moves it from one bubble to the next.

But I wouldn't say that means the entire trade networks are highly regulated whatsoever. They're just well managed and neatly organized to benefit the rich.

Here is what you should have asked Layton...

Mr. Layton,

While you and your party have taken an open stance against the SPP agenda, you have on record expressed support for the NAFTA corridor extending from the US into Manitoba, and ending in the town of Churchill. Several members of your party, such as NDP MP Peter Julian, have outright denied plans for this superhighway, despite the fact that Manitoba NDP Premier Gary Doer, in his government's throne speech on November 20, 2007, endorsed the so-called "Mid Continental Corridor" NAFTA superhighway.

Why should we believe, Mr. Layton, that you serve to do anything more than advertise opposition to the SPP agenda, as a way to deceive those who are truly against this by creating a false opposition?

Well, you're free to write what you want to him as I wrote what I wanted.

Good question.

So who do you think will win? Looks like Dion.
