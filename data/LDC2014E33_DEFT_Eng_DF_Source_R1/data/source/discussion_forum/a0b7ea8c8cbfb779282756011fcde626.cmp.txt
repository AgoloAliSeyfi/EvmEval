LMAO!! And I thought I had run into stupidity before. Social security is so the elderly, poor and infirm won't have to go to a county poor farm to die and end up in an unmarked grave. How do you feel about the 50,000,000 in this country who have no health insurance.

I have a suggestion for you.....next time some Republican bastard starts an unnecessary war how bout you go and help fight the goddam thing.

yes....social security is for the elderly and helps the poor and infirm....so how does Obama's plan to stop paying for SS (i.e. unfunding it by getting rid of the payroll tax) help the elderly, the poor and the infirm.....?

fyi we are flat broke....

Don't forget obama cut medicare too......the first president to ever do so is President Obama (D) and he did so with obamacare.....makes me laugh at the meme "republicans hate the elderly".

No. Obama did not cut Medicare. The cuts dont come from the current Medicare budget, they put a leash on future growth and payment increases.

Congress always seems to be intent on "paying for a tax cut"..... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

We're not hearing much about it.....but it appears that one way to "pay for" the payroll tax cut will be to increase the cost of mortgages....more sneaky fees....

First, I think that the payroll tax cut is a bad idea. I understand the desire to get more money into the hands of people that will circulate it in the economy. However, a tax cut that means less money in the SS funds is hardly a wise move.

In fact, what we need to do, is immediatly restore the tax structure we had under Clinton. Then add another 5% for those making over 1 million a year. Cap the FICA taxes at $500,000, and make is on all income.

Then start to rebuild our grid, to make it both a truly national grid, and to make it less vulneable to natural and manmade disasters. Pay for it the same way we have paid for the Interstate Highway System.

Water systems in this nation are not only in major jeopardy for many our our metropolitan areas, but many of the existings systems lose nearly as much water as they deliver. Water is one of the key three things needed for survival, we are already seeing the some cities reusing sewage water. Time to go to work on that, also.

Kill the F-35 weopons systems, only spend as much on defense as the next 7 nations combined, and the infrastructure improvement become doable.

we've had the payroll tax "holiday" for a year now and it has not helped the economy in any significant way....another leftie failure to fix....

when is the left going to agree to a pro-growth tax structure to bring jobs back..? taxing the rich isn't going to cut it...

agree with you about the water systems and our grids.....disasters in the making....

Actually Obamacare, pushed by the democrats and obama himself, cuts half a trillion from medicare over the next 9 years (the study will say ten years but a year has passed already <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/wink.gif"/> ) <a href="http://www.cms.gov/ActuarialStudies/Downloads/2010TRAlternativeScenario.pdf">http://www.cms.gov/ActuarialStudies/...veScenario.pdf</a>
