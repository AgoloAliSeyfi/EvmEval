Why would Billy be mad at you for going alone? Shouldn't he be freaking out with happiness?

I was just at the most stunning lake and as I was heading into the area I checked a sign board with some info about the lake. There was a notice that a huge black bear had been seen on one of the trails only three days before. We found a women's sunglasses (kinda big with sequins on them) and keys there. We were wondering how they got there and joked we might see the bear coughing out a hair extension and a broken Beyoncé CD.

It's like the whole general discussion section and the research section Basically everywhere that I was regularly posting in and one of the people whom I was respectfully and civilly interacting with and who do not mind polite and reasonable skeptics might ask where the heck I went.

Wouldn't that be weird to remove from public view the entire general discussion section as well as the research section? Also weird that they never returned my email seeking clarification on the nature of my removal. Oh well. Interestingly Washingtonian in his email called it a suspension of my account but this makes it pretty obvious:

Luckily I saved many of my posts there to my email for future refence. I realized when I had a post removed from a thread on the Freeman cast collection politely asking why we could not discuss whether or not we thought the casts from an admitted hoaxer were legitmate that I was in a highly bizarre situation with a Bigfoot enthusiast (Melissa) behaving very weirdly:

That's fine, though. I knew she was very irritated and wanted me gone. She cheerleaded Lyndon when he showed up to debate with me and then when he said he gave up and didn't feel like staying she really seemed irritated. That's what happens when you are heavily biased and can't handle healthy discussion and debate regarding a simple black and white zoological question.

Anyway, this is OT. I will discuss it more in an appropriate thread.

I literally thought when I was at those falls that John would go nuts if he could see this place. It was PNW rainforest on steroids.

I Thought that the PNW consists of temperate Rainforests only?

You thought wrong, and you didn't do any research.

First we need to know what you consider to be the PNW.

Billy just worries about me because he has seen me freak out in the woods plenty of times. I am sure deep down he is happy, but he wants me to understand I should not go out alone as inexperienced and scared as I am.
When I told him it was just a park he calmed down.

Billy was right. NC is a bear hotspot and the big ones are near the coast.

"The next morning I decided to stalk the bear," Rose said. "I used cover along ditches to sneak to the field. I shot the bear with a.270 at 175 yards."

The bear weighed 635 pounds. After drying, the skull scored 21, making the All-Time Boone and Crockett record book.

"The bear was a short distance from Dismal Swamp Refuge," Rose said. "That may have helped him get so big."

Robert Norville is the commission's District 2 wildlife biologist. Norville said the biggest bears in the state occur along the Pamlico County-Beaufort County line.

"I remember last year one party brought in a pair of bears that were almost identical and the bears weighed around 450 pounds each," Norville said. "One we checked at the Pamlico-Beaufort line weighed over 600 pounds. For the largest bears in the state, Hyde and Beaufort counties have been swapping bragging rights during recent seasons."

As good as the mountain hunting can be, hunters kill more bears in the coastal region, and bear weights are also heavier.

I would vote that an inexperienced kid got sick in the woods and collapsed, and when he began to recover he saw a big bear standing up and feeding in the distance and blew it out of proportion from being scared and sick and worried and a bit confused about what happened to him.

Apparently one of the biggest American Black Bears ever recorded was a male from North Carolina that weighed 400 kilograms...

Interesting fact. I would not have thought that. Most of the black bears I have seen in VA and NC have been small. Now the ones in PA were huge and more prevalent.

Or WGBH could have seen a Bigfoot. He either saw it or he did not see it. Lets focus on both explanations.
