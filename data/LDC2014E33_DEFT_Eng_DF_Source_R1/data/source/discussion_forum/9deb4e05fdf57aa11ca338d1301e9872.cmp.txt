Of COURSE the media is in the bag for Gingrich. They would LOVE to see him represent the GOP. Easy target, lots of baggage, a verbal gaffe just waiting to happen. The only thing better than Gingrich would be Gingrich/Palin. Holy crap, they'd think they had died and gone to heaven.

You are aware that the Obama team are afraid of Newt getting the nomination aren't you. In debates, Newt will kick Obama's pseudo-intellectual butt up one side of the stage and down the other. After all, all Obama has to run on is his dismal record and that alone has him pissing his pants.

Still reheating that old food? I thought Obama was afraid of Trump, Pailin, Perry and Cain? What happened?

</quote>

Nope, never heard it and never said it. Newt will kick ass in a debate with Obama.

We already know that you are retarded.

What I want to see is a presidential debate where obama brings up Gingrich's past affairs and Gingrich says "In both of your books you describe your cocaine addiction. How about you give us the name of your dealer and how much you bought."

I think his goofy rhetoric just gets eyeballs pointing at some screen be it a TV, tablet, smartphone, etc...

Better to quote him/opine on him and get the attention as a result than not.

At it's heart, I think the members of the media from all outlets are just as worried about how a Gingrich presidency would hold.... kids scrubbing toilets, orphanages, etc... Its about as far away from the ideal of America as one can get.

</quote>

But when Obama suggested the same exact thing, it was labelled by the media and the left as a "wonderful" idea.

Or did you forget abouyt Obama saying that all our younger generation should get involved at the community level....helping senior citizens, working in community centers, etc...

Did you think he wanted them to do things like tax reporting and community planning...you know...things that require advanced educattions??

</quote>

You can provide a quote he wanted kids to do janitorial duties? I can for Newt. Your move.
