I think it's the school's job to stay involved with the kids in terms of healthy habits/lifestyles. That being said, I think it should come from a school-wide effort, where nobody is singled out.

Although, in extreme cases I would agree with a NURSE sending out a letter of concern to a parent. As much as I wish we could say we are the sole parents of our kids, we give up a lot of time to schools... they have a certain responsibility to the wellfare of the kiddos too.

For maybe a 5 pound difference like you're saying, hell no. That's just asking for self-esteem issues. But I can't get mad at a school for trying to combat one of the biggest medical issues in the US right now, especially for children.

I can't believe they did that. Really, do they know how many eating disorders this can cause? Especially if the kid already has poor self-esteem.

I understand that they want to educate the parents and children about maintaining a healthy weight, but instead why not teach that in a health class? Teach the kids how to eat healthy, give them recipes to take home to mum that are nutritional. There are so many better ways they could go about doing this.

Idk. I think part of my opposition is based on the fact that I think schools butt in way too much, which is 90% of why I want to do homeschooling if I can. But then I do understand that there are kids out there who need it or they would have nothing. But in that case then what is a letter to the parents going to do? Like I said that letter would have had zero effect on my home life except to make me feel like crap. And at the same time a school telling me that I have to do x or be considered neglecting my child would make me LIVID. What if I couldn't afford a doctor? Are they gonna pay for my appointment since they're threatening me with child neglect?

Have a class. Have a fucking health night. Take the crap out of the cafeteria. But don't send my 12 year old girl a letter saying she's overweight when she's barely if at all(I really don't see how she's overweight lol)

If a nurse sent letters to parents of obese kids or children bordering on obesity I would be more understanding I think because obesity is a big problem.

Idk I just think that a child could take that to mean they are fat and gross, not just needing to lose a couple pounds.
