How many years have they been working on renewable energy?

This pipeline is something WE need now..not only for the energy that would come from a friendly neighbor, but FOR JOBS..remember those things Obama and the Democrats say they were focused on..?

I'm totally disgusted with this President..

Didn't say much about renewable energy, did I? I was talking about our 1940's technology electrical grid. I'd bet more PERMANENT JOBS would be created in the upgrade and maintenance of a smart grid than the pipeline.

You see, I think the problem is that "big energy" doesn't want the smart grid. Because they charge us for their inefficiency....at a profit.... yes, they even profit on the inefficiencies. If we went to a more efficient transmission of our electricity, they wouldn't be able to gouge us as much.

Did you ever think that the reason we've been working on renewable energy for so long is that the energy lobby really doesn't want it to happen?

Look, I'm not all that much of a tree hugger.... but you have to think beyond the "political" box. I know it's easy to blame gubmint for everything... but there are other forces out there that manipulate too.

That's why I question the Conservative mantra of "Critical Thinking". The only thing that Conservatives Apply those skills to is government, and more specifically... Obama.

The huge point that you are missing is that Keystone will be paid for with other people's money not our tax dollars.

While upgrading the grid is needed we just don't have the money and we certainly don't need to be billions more in debt.

Keystone will cost us nothing and it will generate tax revenue.

Even if what you say is true... which I doubt. I don't doubt you believe it, I just doubt that it's so. Anyway... look at the number... 60%.... that's the amount of WASTE in our electrical grid. That 60%(and the other 40%) is what we as consumers, businesses and government gets charged for in our electric bills. Not to mention all the coal and oil that gets wasted in the production of electricity.

It's virtually impossible not to have ANY loss. But European Countries have narrowed it down to only a 20% loss and Japan has pushed the envelope to 10%. We can't even do 50/50 in our current grid system.

It's not that we can't afford it, it's that we can't afford NOT to.

They recently built a reproduction of the worlds first electric car. You want to know what's funny...it had the same range as the new ones give or take a few miles. Hows that for sad, slightly over 100 years worth of research and they havn't gone much further.

yeah... because we've been trying so hard.

Aw... poor americans can't more of their precious black gold. WHA!! Jesus. you all sound like a bunch of little children who can't get their favorite toy. Get over it. Try not DRIVING so much, or riding a bicycle for once, then maybe we all wouldn't be so obese. Oh, that's right, we're American, so we are entitled to any and everything no matter what the cost is. Some of you make me literally sick to my stomach.

What makes me sick is how many people evidently would rather have another supertanker shipwreck i.e. Exxon Valdez spilling 700,000 barrels in the ocean then a quickly shut down, easily fixed maximum of 300 barrels of oil being spilled!

I mean where are you environmentalists HEADS??

DUH.. isn't 1 million barrels MORE then 300 barrels???

HOW much more simple can it be explained???
