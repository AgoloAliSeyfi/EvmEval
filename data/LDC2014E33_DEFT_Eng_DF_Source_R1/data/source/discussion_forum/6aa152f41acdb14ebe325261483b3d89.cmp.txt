Legal codes enforce matters properly defined in philosophy as ethical or moral. "Thou shall not steal" is a moral imperative (or a Commandment from God) and codified in the Penal Code of all states. Government does enforce morality.

Laws against theft and murder were around a long time before Moses wrote them on a rock. Did we forget that Moses was forced to flee Egypt for murdering someone? Theft is illegal not because it's necessarily immoral but because it infringes on the rights of others.

</quote>

Of course there were prohibitions against theft and murder before Moses, that was expressed in my post (Moral Imperative).

Can you clarify your remark, specifically, "theft is illegal not because it's necessarily immoral" with an example of when theft is moral or amoral?

moral theft... stealing the car keys off a drunk driver.

The Catholic Church is opposed to contraception for moral reasons.

Where is the morality in creating a life when food and clean water are rare commodities? Where poverty exists and educational opportunities are non existent?

Where is the morality when disease is spread?

Where is the morality when a women is the victim of domestic violence? When a women is forced to conceive and then trapped as the child become a lever to gain more power and more control?

The Churches take on morality is theirs and theirs alone. As for the birth control issue-

As to the food and water issue, The Catholic Church alone, has done more to get more food and water to starving people then you have or ever will. Its there right to provide there employees what the will.

The point I made regarding food and clean water, as well as disease, was focused specifically on current events in Africa. Not only is the Catholic Church opposed to contraception but the Bush Adminsitrtion was opposed to any efforts to protect pregnanat women (and their unborn children) from disease - water born &amp; AIDS - and poor prenatal nutrition.

I have no doubt the Catholic Church engages in good works and I have no problem with their moral objection to abortion. What I object to, strongly, is stupidity. How is preventing a child's conception a moral issue and how is it any business of the church. The answer is quite simple, more births = more Catholics = more power and money.

So, in your opinion, a church which engages in animal sacrifice or practices polyandry/polygamy should be beyond the reach of law?

</quote>

There is a difference between disallowing a behavior and forcing someone into a behavior.

</quote>

So the church is disabllowing its members from using birth control, the punishment for doing so will be the loss of entry into heaven. How is that different than forcing a behavior?

</quote>

cause the church don't come into your bedroom. idiot. a great many catholics do purchase and use birth control.. they're smarter than obie wan though, they have enough sense not to demand that the church pay for it. boy is he dumb as a box of rocks.
