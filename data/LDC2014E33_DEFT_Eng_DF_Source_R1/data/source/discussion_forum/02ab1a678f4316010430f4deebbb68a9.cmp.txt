I know the question wasn't directed at me, but I'll do my best at answering your questions from my point of view.

Independence would not be a magic fix to recession. What it would do is provide the Welsh Government of the day with all the tools to get Wales out of recession. Wales has been in permanent recession, relative to the rest of the UK, for two decades. GVA per capita in Wales has fallen from 84% of the UK average in 1995 to 74% today, the lowest in the UK. Evidently something is not right with the Welsh economy. I would lay the blame at the door of the economics promoted by elected politicians of every colour at Westminster since Thatcher; the promotion of the City of London before all else, the consequential neglect of sectors on which Wales relies, like manufacturing, and the neglect of infrastructure in the peripheral regions of the UK. Those economics are not going to change in the foreseeable future, no matter what party is in government in Westminster. The economy is simply too reliant on the City of London. The only way out of this rut that Wales is in that I can see is to have a government in Cardiff with the will and the means to level the playing field in Britain, be that through lowering corporation tax, investing in infrastructure, doing everything it can to build up the manufacturing sector once more, or, preferably, all three at once. Long story short, Westminster isn't interesting in fixing the Welsh economy.

Wales is underfunded in relation to the English regions. The cross-party <a href="http://wales.gov.uk/newsroom/firstminister/2010/100706holtham/?lang=en">Holtham Commission</a>, which was set up to review the funding of the Welsh Government, <a href="http://wales.gov.uk/docs/icffw/report/100705fundingsettlementsumen.pdf">suggested the replacement of the Barnett Formula</a>, a blunt instrument which apportions finance on the basis of population alone, to a needs-based formula where central government takes into account the relative deprivation of each nation and region. This already happens in England; were it to be applied to the devolved nations as well, the Welsh Government would receive more money, and the Scottish Government less. Hence the argument that Wales is underfunded; if a fair funding formula were instituted, Wales would receive somewhere in the region of Â£300 million more per year. Believe it or not, England isn't the only place where the Barnett Formula is scorned.

All arguments come down to 'wah, wah, London isn't paying us enough attention, wah, wah'. You have a Welsh Parliament who could have done just that. Stop blaming for English for that fact Wales has done comparatively badly - your country has failed to get foreign investment, it depends upon manufacturing which is right now being hit very hard; it's not the fault of the English. London doesn't suck money out of Wales; it subsidises it. 300 million is what the UK pays to the EU in a week; peanuts. As far as undersubsidising goes:

It hits national pride hard to admit you're pretty much an economic irrelevance and you have little potential especially given a big nationwide recession, so you find a common enemy in the English. I have to say the vast majority of Welsh people don't, but you get some bitter people who have their whole world view based on this particular scenario; the Welsh vs the English and is a massively flawed and oversimplified way of looking at things.

Errr how can the Welsh government do it when controlling the economy isn't one of the devolved areas? The Welsh economy is in the hands of the British government. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/>
Nobody blames the English people you moron, people blame the British government. Stop calling people anti-English because they support independence.
