How, How, How...on God's green earth can Conservatives square THIS little bit of nuggetry from the Newt?

Newt, in politics, has a near perfect conservative record over 35 years. No one can match that. Any change he wants in government is toward a more conservative government that would in effect make liberalism nearly illegal as our Founders intended with the Constitution.

Gingrich Plummets in Polls as Voters Start Remembering Who He Is

Dawning Awareness Threatens Campaign

<quote>
<img src="http://www.borowitzreport.com/wp-content/uploads/newt.jpg"/> DES MOINES ( <a href="http://bit.ly/rIvDGZ">The Borowitz Report</a> ) – In a development that has imperiled his front-runner status in the Republican presidential race, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has plunged in the polls as voters have begun to remember who he is.

Mr. Gingrich had been surging in recent weeks, but according to pollster Davis Logsdon of the University of Minnesota’s Opinion Research institute, “That was before people’s memories of who New Gingrich is started gradually kicking in.”

According to a new poll released today, Mr. Gingrich fared especially poorly among voters who agreed with the statement, “Wait a minute, that guy? He was an enormous dick.”

“Newt Gingrich has got to do something fast to keep people from remembering who he is,” pollster Logsdon said. “He might try growing a moustache or wearing an eye patch, but that might be too little, too late.”

On the ground in Iowa, Gingrich campaign strategists are working overtime to confront the challenge posed by voters remembering who he is, aides to the former House Speaker said today.

According to one campaign source, the Gingrich campaign has begun seeking the support of people with mental disorders and other memory issues that make it hard for them to retain basic information.
“The problem is, most of those people are currently running for President,” the source said.
In other political news, the Romney campaign unveiled a new slogan today: “You’re Out of Other Options.”
