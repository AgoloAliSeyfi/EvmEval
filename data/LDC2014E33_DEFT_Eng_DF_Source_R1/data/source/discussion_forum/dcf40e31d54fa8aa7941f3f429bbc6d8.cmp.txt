You guys really think we are an honorable nation anymore?

Take a look at any headline.

Corruption, crime is rampant.

Our economy is in the middle of a depression because people had no honor or integrity in their business dealings.

Look at the past 4 administrations. You honestly think we've had honorable people in power most of those times?

We get corrupt politicians because the people are themselves corrupt. We need to begin empowering people with integrity and truth again. Because we are going to be going through some pain soon. It's inevitable. The only question is whether we are prepared for it or not.

Does anyone honestly think we can continue spending carelessly with no consequences? Doesn't matter whether it's personal or public spending, eventually the bill comes in and if we aren't ready, we are screwed.

Does anyone honestly think we can tolerate corruption in our politicians and bueaucracies and there are no consequences?

You think we can have a strong economy when we can't trust one another?

Do you think we can be world leaders when others can't trust us?

You think our children will grow to be honorable people if they see us being dishonest and easily corrupted?

Every single individual needs to look at their lives. They need to root out all corruption. They need to be honest in word and deed. They need to do what they say they will do. They need to do what it takes to meet their responsibilities to take care of themselves, their families, and then do what they can for the community at large.

I am the first one to acknowledge that I need work. Can you honestly say you don't?

And don't confuse honor with pride.

And Glenn Beck has the way to improve upon all those evils? Uh huh... He perpetuates hatred, period. If it were all about losing our "honor" over the past several years, why wasn't someone who exemplifies that "honor" asked to speak? Why not someone like General Patreaus or Rick Warren? Or both? I know I would love to hear speeches from them about restoring honor and dignity, and September 12th would have been the perfect day. But Sarah Palin? Puleeze. This whole rally is political in nature, just shy of the midterm election 2 months away. It's a fucking smokescreen to rev up the tribe and get radicals elected.

another dumbass. i love it. where was anything political mentioned at the rally? Ive watched the whole thing and all that is spoken about is love for the founding principles, love for our veterans, the honorable gift of charity, and sacrafice that made america free. If you take issue with that, then you are the one who is full of hatred. get a clue.

I didn't watch the rally.

But I didn't have to, to know Maggie is only another wingnut prone to pulling her opinion out of her ass and waving it around as "fact."

It is obvious to any thinking American that we have lost the path of honor.. It does not NEED pointed out..

</quote>

That is...a... really dumb statement.

<quote orig_author="HUGGY">
especially from the likes of Beck. His pathetic rally doesn't restore anything.

</quote>

It isn't supposed to restore/solve anything. It is supposed to bring light to a problem.

<quote orig_author="HUGGY">
It is a rally for the simple minded.

</quote>

Or one that simple minds cannot comprehend.

<quote orig_author="HUGGY">
Talking "honor" is bullshit. You either have it or you don't. It does inspire disgust to see a Rupert Murdoch lackey speak of honor.

Wow, Im quite amazed I had to write this at all. Its about restoring honor of our country by "we the people". Now reading some of the posts I find it Quite alarming for anyone to say our country doesnt need to take a serious look at restoring its honor. Not to mention for Individuals to look at restoring their honor. Maybe For some I suspect its all about hatred towards who's asking us to do it(Glenn Beck). For whatever your reasons I sure dont understand you. Are you really that Obtuse to whats going on in this country. The lack of honesty, integrity, the outright abandonment of character, when a mans word is constantly abandoned, the lack of shame, the ease in which many take advantage of one another. Cant you See that. I really dont think theres two meanings of the word honor. Its not right honor vs. left honor, red state honor vs. Blue state honor. In fact its entirely non partisan. If we cant come together as americans to look at the meaning of honor and seriously take an honest look at where were falling short as individuals and as a nation. Then does any of this even matter?

</quote>

Most older generations have never "lost" the meaning of honor. Perhaps special invitations should have been sent to the materialistic Generations X, Y and Z reminding them that "honor" starts at home, by honoring your family, your neighbor, your country--not amassing "stuff" and learning to hate and bully when YOU are not the center of attention.

It's been decades since Glenn Beck or the Republicans have had "honor". Decades.

</quote>

So then you agree with his wish and attempt to try and "Restore Honor"?

</quote>

In order to restore it, you have to have had it.... rdrool wouldn't be able to find it in the dictionary, yet alone within himself. Happily, he's not alone. The lefties were born without honor, they live without honor and die without ever even understanding the word.

Bullshit.
