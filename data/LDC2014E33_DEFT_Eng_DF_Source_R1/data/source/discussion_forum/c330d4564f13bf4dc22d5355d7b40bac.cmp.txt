What a retarded poll.

First off - MA was predominately about local politics (the same reason that a Democrat won that NY seat in a Republican stronghold) - local issues and someone who LISTENED to what the people were saying - economy, jobs, deficits etc. Partisan morons on both sides are try to make it into party referendums or a referendum on the President. Yet President Obama still enjoys wide approval by the MA voters. The other issue - MA's feelings about healthcare reform is also somewhat colored by the fact that MA has it's own affordable healthcare program in place so it's far less of a priority to it's citizens than economy and jobs.

If you really think Obama is a "radical socialist" you really need to bone up on your history. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

<img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> Obama's approval ratings are PLUMMETING around the nation! you have got to be kidding, even in California!

</quote>

While they are decreasing (they started off unrealistically high) - he still maintains pretty decent approval.

Even Brown said that the election was not a referendum on the president: "It's not a referendum on the president. There are many issues; you're talking about national security, taxes, spending -- the health care plan certainly is important."

It is, however a warning shot that he needs to listen to what people are concerned about.

MA Exit polls showed strong support for Obama:

<a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections2/election_2010/election_2010_senate_elections/massachusetts/brown_wins_stunning_victory_in_massachusetts">Rasmussen</a> : 53 percent of Massachusetts voters approve of the way that Barack Obama has handled his job as President.

<a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0110/31708_Page2.html#ixzz0d9eLKtKA">Fabrizio, McLaughlin &amp; Associates</a> : Obama held a 59 percent favorability mark and 55 percent job approval rating among MA voters.

Obama claims that voter anger in Massachusettes (the FAIL of the health care bill) is because of George W Bush

bwahahahahahahaha

Do you fall for this?

Oh Massachusettes really showed President Bush!

And Obama was SO BUSY working for us..."that I think we lost some of that sense of speaking directly to the American people about what their core values are"

OH MY GOSH THATS IT!!!! I missed one of the 411 speeches and statements Obama made during the year...I didn't realize my core value to be a radical socialist!!!

Meanwhile the NAACP is trying to paint a happy face on socialism by saying Martin Luther King was a socialist

Unbelievable!

Okay so now who is falling for all this?

Ratings and net worth have nothing to do with the fact that his crying makes him look silly. All it means is that a lot of people are willing to watch his silliness.

Jay Leno's chin makes him look silly.

Yeah, but the chin is a birth defect, lol. Beck's crying can be controlled. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

Barry suffers from Narcissistic Personality Disorder and thus he can't fathom that the voter's anger in MA would ever possibly be directed at him and at his administration run amuck. His ego blinds him.

Brown's win was a direct smack down of this admin and a complete rejection of the piles of dung being shoved down our throats.

Anyone who believes otherwise is delusional.

Oh and he keeps blaming Bush for the last eight years. I agree.... as 7 belong to Bush and 1 to Obama. Yep, folks are angry alright.

According to what? How do you explain MA voters high personal approval of Obama?

I listen to Beck for a lot of reasons, regardless of ratings.

I listen to Jesus because He always leads me out of trouble (that I keep somehow finding)
