It seems EVERYTHING they do benefits the top 1 percent of income earners in the US.'Socialism for the rich'.Making the rich,richer has nothing to do with being conservative.To show how things changed,President Eisenhower(republican) was asked to lower taxes for the very rich,he said NO.The very rich back then were taxed at 90 percent.Many people keep falling for this CON-GAME that lower taxes on the rich benefits everyone.It benefits NO-ONE except the wealthy.

and they use those tactics to scare people. Dems are going to "raise your taxes." Repubs will "cut my taxes." But the people who buy that bullshit aren't the ones who really get the breaks. They just get a bone thrown to them so they shut up.

Republicans have always pushed for a regressive income tax. The poorer you are, the higher percentage you pay (you don't get all the loopholes because you don't have 5 homes to write off, huge investments to write off, tax brokers to "tweek" your income statments, etc.) They justify it by claiming all that wealth trickles down to the poor because it CREATES JOBS. That's the biggest load of crap statement, BTW...

Dems generally want progressive income tax. The more you earn the more you pay (because they know you get all those loopholes anyway.)

It's just another form of fear-mongering/flag-waving, except with money.

"real large" I agree.--The US used to have the 'sliding scale' tax system.The more you earned the more you paid.Everything worked much better that way.--Nowadays courtesy of the republican party,and a number of democrats there are SO many loopholes that the very rich often wind up paying very little to almost NOTHING in taxes.Some people call this free enterprise or capitalism,I say it's welfare for the wealthy!Warren Buffet one of the richest men in the US himself said the rich should be taxed alot more.

I think it was Warren Buffet who I saw on 60 Minutes or another news show about a year ago -- around tax time. He introduced the reporter to his secretary and said somethig like: "She makes forty thousand dollars a year and pays more income tax than I do."

And this guy is worth millions (maybe over a billion). At least he has a guilty conscience about it.

Here's the written piece. It's the Washington Post so you can't say it has a liberal bias.

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/27/AR2007062700097.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn...062700097.html</a>

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Warren+Buffett?tid=informline">Warren E. Buffett</a> was his usual folksy self Tuesday night at a fundraiser for <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Hillary+Clinton?tid=informline">Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.)</a> as he slammed a system that allows the very rich to pay taxes at a lower rate than the middle class.
Buffett cited himself, the third-richest person in the world, as an example. Last year, Buffett said, he was taxed at 17.7 percent on his taxable income of more than $46 million. His receptionist was taxed at about 30 percent.

Warren Buffet is worth many BILLIONS of dollars.He was taxed 17 percent and his receptionist 30 percent,unbelievable and unacceptable!---It seems far too many Americans put the rich on a pedestal.In third world countries the rich pay little taxes also.
