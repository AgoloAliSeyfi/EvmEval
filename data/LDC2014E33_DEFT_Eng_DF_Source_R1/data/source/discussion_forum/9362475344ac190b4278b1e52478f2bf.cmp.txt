Your response to that central point seems to be 'well things change'...

you then told me I was too draconian about it and should leave my country... and then started talking about alcohol related crime...

Now, I'm simply saying how and why I think hostility to immigration arises... that was your original question... and I have said how and why I think it arises.

When you say well 'things change', the point is that people can bring about change from within or it can be imposed upon them. And in the case of modern immigration this change has been uninvited and imposed upon English people, they feel that they are no longer in control of their country.

the rest of your post generally seemed to be a bit of a slapdash diatribe against this country and how awful it is... talking about imperialism etc... and how 'we're all immigrants'... and customs and excise... I wish you werent so ashamed of your country and its history and culture.

A quick point in defence of our hospitality to immigrants in the past when they have arrived in manageable numbers.

We have in the past welcomed Huguenots fleeing from France (my Grandfather being descended from them), as well as Dutch and Germans when their Princes became our Kings. We provided safety for Jew's fleeing eastern and central Europe. All without problem. And the right to asylum is still enshrined as untouchable in English law despite the criminal abuse of it.

Ok here's a link about one in five births (my mistake its five not four)

and if you look here you'll see England is now in fact only 83 percent 'white british'... whatever the hell that means.

Yes I apologise, wasn't the best structured piece of writing ever, I tend to loose my head abit when I'm typing of the top of my head.

However i think your now attempting to shame me. I never said I think this country is awful. In fact im part of a minority who aren't always banging on about how its gone to the dogs. I will be honest that yes, maybe I am embarrassed about some peoples attitudes to things such as immigration.

Please don't dismiss all of my previous counter argument no matter how crappily its written. Do you think this country would have been and is what it is without foreign influences. My point was that unfortunately things do change and nothing is ever the same. My point which you turned into focusing about alcohol related crime was meant to question, would an individual from 100 years ago regard what you regard as the British way of life.

Anyways, I in no way intended to confuse you or dismiss what you said,
as although your views are not shared by me, it is good to see things from the other persons perspective.

Merry Christmas

Also you get all these papers spewing out stories of Muslim children beating up pensioners or the most recent one involving a Christian teacher being sacked as a result of offering to pray for a sick student.

So much emphasize is put on Muslims trying to install Sharia Law in our country and black youths being behind knife and gun crime.

People talk about these topics as if they are experts in the field just because they read about it in that morning paper. How many of you people have actually yourself been forced to convert to Islam or been sacked for praying? Perhaps the reason immigrants fill British prisons is due to the fact that they are forced to live in the worst crime ridden areas as they have no money and their lives are influenced on what is going on around them. People have no idea of these individuals cultures so to label them as "criminal by nature" is in itself grossly ignorant.

I've heard on this forum someone comment that "to be a true briton you should vote bnp"........................... ? So the definition of a true briton is someone who is unaware of the world around them and instead relies on stupid spiteful comments about other cultures?

Anyway thats my rant, not very well structured i know just came on the end of a comment by someone i know. By the way I am White British and have been attacked by kurds however, i have suffered more on the hands of british white youths rather then there ethnic counterparts and thats despite living in areas of high ethnic populations.

But yes whats your opinions on immigrants, i welcome arguments based on both sides of the spectrum but if you are going to hold immigrants to blame for something or slate them, please back your point up with some factual evidence rather then a single story from a paper or manipulated statistics from the bnp website.

Share.

Why are you so ignorant of people? Thats a better question.

Its obvious why people resent great numbers of foreigners.
