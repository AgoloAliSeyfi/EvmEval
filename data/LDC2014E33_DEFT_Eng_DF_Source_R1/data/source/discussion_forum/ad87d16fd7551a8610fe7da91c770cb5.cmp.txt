American blue-collar workers are screwed. Why?

The average world labourer increases their standard of living by out-competing American workers. They work harder and for less money, until they win their share of the industrial jobs.

In other words, for every American factory worker paid $40k a year, there are four Chinese/Indian/African factory workers being forced out on the street.

Likewise, fore every American factory worker forced out on the street, there are four Chinese/Indian/African factory workers who start making a living wage.

Why will the Chinese/Indian/African worker win? The alternative for the Chinese/Indian/African worker is severe poverty, possibly starvation. The alternative for the American worker is a welfare check that is bigger than the Chinese/Indian/African worker's entire paycheck.

Thus, the situation of blue-collar America will not improve, even as the economy recovers.

<quote orig_author="Working Man">
Wally World stocks more cheap stuff than just about anyone else. Most of the crap is made off shore in Asia, or some other place where they can realize the highest profits. But, I don't hear the masses bitching about the lack of jobs. Most Americans are just to dumb to realize that their way of life is going to be changing for the worse and we are barely seeing the results of their apathy. Until Americans can stem the flow of US greenbacks down, and slow the tide of cheap off shore junk coming in, having Hamburger Helper may start to seem like a celebration.

I suspect we are going to see the standard of living, for blue collar workers, to plummet even deeper. In the meantime, these BCWs will stop at Wally Workd for a new Chinese flat screen so that they can look at their REALITY shows, basketball tournaments, etc at 1080p.

Wonderful.

Why is buying goods at a good cheap prices dumb?

People make no sense sometimes.

True. It also makes no sense to insist on putting your own employer out of business with union greed.

Still trying to believe that the world is a zero sum game? It doesn't work this way.

</quote>

Not exactly, but the truth is there regarding the point made. If a company can hire unskilled labor for $0.12/hr, it can hire 8 for $1.00/hr, sell their stuff at a low price to the guy that demanded $7.75/hr to do the same task.

The world economy game is being won by China.

About 80% of them have already.
For instance if we made cars without robots it would take 10X the manpower to produce what we now produce.

Actually, it's people who build the robots since not enough are being made to create an assembly line. It's people who make the precision parts the robots are made from. People who design the robots. People who are the technicians to maintain the robots. People who install and program the robots. People who design the parts the robots make.

All that takes "education". Something Republicans "mock". Odd that.

</quote>

And of all that only the maintenance and perhaps the engineering is generally US provided.

As far as the workers maintaining and manufacturing the robots. A tech education is a must, but almost equally as important is experience. I did that type of work for a few years.

</quote>

...and even if the maintenance and engineering is US provided, the personnel could be working for a foreign employer.

yes. anything that can be done without critical thinking can be programmed into a robot to do. since building a robot from peices doesn't require critical thinking, one day robots will build robots and then humans will only be needed for trouble shooting, designing, and programming them. I think those who have rejected science will finally realize their fautls at this point since there will be little jobs available for them. even more advanced jobs could be taken over by robots if AI continues to improve, and of course if robots become capable of learning on their own then humans are no longer needed at all.

computers can only be as smart as whomever is programming them.
But they are extremely accurate and consistent. Much better than humans for many jobs actually.

Call for computer tech support and you may be connected to someone willing to work for $0.12/hr searching through a FAQ manual...likely in India.
