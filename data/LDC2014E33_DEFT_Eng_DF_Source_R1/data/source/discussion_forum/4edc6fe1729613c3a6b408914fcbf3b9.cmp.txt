This is absolutely sickening. What in God's name is going on with the Federal Government? The Obama administration?

The world's largest oil skimmer has sat immobile for weeks on end as the BP Oil leak gushed. Obama golfed. Obama wined and dined. Obama fundraised. Obama wagged his finger at BP.

For the last 66 days the entire American skimming effort has resulted in 600,000 gallons of oil skimmed. The projected capabilities of the "A-Whale" skimmer is 500,000 gallons PER DAY.

Are Americans simply suffering from an incredibly inept and self-involved White House, or is it something even more dubious...?

______

The A-Whale bills itself as the largest open-water oil skimmer in the world, and its at least very impressive. Originally an oil and ore tanker, the ships owners recently refitted the ship to do exactly the kind of work that the US so desperately needs in the Gulf of Mexico, and to do it on a vastly larger scale than current operations can handle. According to the ships project manager, the entire American effort in 66 days has skimmed off 600,000 barrels of oil. The ships owners claim that A-Whale can skim 500,000 barrels a day

So where is the A-Whale now? In the Gulf? Not yet. Its on its way there after being tied to a dock in Norfolk, Virginia, and wont be allowed to join the cleanup effort until the Coast Guard and the EPA figure out whether it meets their standards

...Overton blasted BP and the federal government for a lack of effort and coordination in their dual oil-spill response and made a plea to the government to allow the A Whale to join the cleanup operation.

... This, by the way, is Day 68 of the Gulf crisis. The A-Whale didnt get refitted on Day 66; this work had to have been done over months, if not years. Shouldnt the government have known about the existence of this ship two months ago, and been working on certifying it immediately? The A-Whale shouldnt have had to stop at Norfolk at all to get the nations attention, but should have been hired to steam directly to the Gulf and get to work immediately. Its indicative of a crisis management team that is spending more time worrying about regulations and red tape than cleaning up the mess, just as we saw with Packgens boom.

NORFOLK, Va. (WAVY) - The 'A Whale' is headed South after a stop in Hampton Roads. Her crew's mission is to remove some of the oil from the spill in the Gulf of Mexico before it reaches the shores.

The 'A Whale', originally an ore and oil carrier, was converted into the world's largest oil skimming vessel just one week ago.

Does that answer your question, there, Sinatra?

68 days ago the A Whale was NOT online to be a oil skimmer.

And FYI it just arrived in the USA.

But hey don't let the facts get in the way of your obsessional hatred with Obama.

Where are they going to put all those boats when a storm comes along?

Doesn't matter, that will just be Obama's fault as well.

And yet more evidence: 1500 oil skimmers not being utilized in the clean-up and shoreline protection effort:

Jones Act: Maritime politics strain Gulf oil spill cleanup

Pressure is building for President Obama to lift a 1920 protectionist law so that high-tech foreign oil skimmers can help with the Gulf oil spill. Why are 1,500 available US oil skimmers not on the scene?

Wowza...that's at least 1500 jobs right there! And I'm going to assume that it takes several people to operate each skimmer...so that's even MORE jobs!

But even more importantly, why are we letting valuable time run by and allowing more of the mess to spread?? It's outrageous.

Why? Gulf States voted for Palin and Obama needs the tar to pass Cap &amp; Trade
