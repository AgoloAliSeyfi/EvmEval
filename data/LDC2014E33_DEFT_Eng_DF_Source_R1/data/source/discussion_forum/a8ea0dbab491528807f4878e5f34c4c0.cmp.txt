12. The fanatical islamist textbooks used to indoctrinate Afghan kids came from the US government

Why has the US been Shipping Muslim Extremist Schoolbooks into Afghanistan...for 20 Years?

And why is President Bush hiding it?

Washington Post investigators report that during the past twenty years the US has spent millions of dollars producing fanatical schoolbooks, which were then distributed in Afghanistan.

Only one English-speaking newspaper we could find has investigated this issue: the Washington Post. The story appeared March 23rd.

Washington Post investigators report that during the past twenty years the US has spent millions of dollars producing fanatical schoolbooks, which were then distributed in Afghanistan.

"The primers, which were filled with talk of jihad and featured drawings of guns, bullets, soldiers and mines, have served since then as the Afghan school system's core curriculum. Even the Taliban used the American-produced books..."
-- Washington Post, 23 March 2002
See footnote

According to the Post the U.S. is now "...wrestling with the unintended consequences of its successful strategy of stirring Islamic fervor to fight communism."

So the books made up the core curriculum in Afghan schools. And what were the unintended consequences? The Post reports that according to unnamed officials the schoolbooks "steeped a generation in violence."

"Afghan security officials said those killed were an American colonel and major. Local media reports suggest the incident followed a "verbal clash".

"The BBC's Orla Guerin in Kabul says eight shots were reported inside the building, which should be one of the safest in the capital, and that any Afghan who carried out the attack would have had the highest clearance."

9. We need to get the FUC* out of there...

We're not wanted; we're not going to change things, and we need to cut our losses now and get O-U-T!! What is our ultimate goal there? From what the military leaders will say, "We are so close to victory in Afghanistan." Remind anybody of Vietnam?

13. Instead of just saying "Oops, sorry about those Korans getting burnt up", how about Obama says

"... and the US is going to show you HOW sorry we are, by leaving Afghans to
run their own country for a change.

Not that it will be pretty, how that plays out on the ground there, but at least
the US Blood &amp; Treasure won't continue to be shoveled into a black hole to make
things progressively worse and worse and worse. geesh. <img src="http://www.democraticunderground.com/emoticons/banghead.gif"/>

NATO personnel recalled from Afghan ministries after killing of 2 Americans

Washington Post | By Kevin Sieff | Updated: Saturday, February 25, 5:02 PM

STRINGER/REUTERS - Afghan protesters shout anti-U.S. slogans during a protest in Kunduz province. Four people were shot dead by Afghan security forces on Saturday as protests over the burnings of the Muslim holy book at a NATO base erupted for a fifth day, with an attempt by demonstrators to bombard a U.N. compound in the north.

KABUL  The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan on Saturday recalled all NATO personnel working in Afghan ministries in the Kabul area  a bold and potentially divisive response to the killing of two American service members by an Afghan security official in the countrys fortified Interior Ministry earlier in the day.

Marine Gen. John R. Allens directive comes five days after U.S. military personnel burned a pile of Korans at the largest military base in Afghanistan in an apparently inadvertent act that set off violent protests across the country. More than 25 Afghans have died in those demonstrations, and four NATO soldiers have been killed by men wearing Afghan security uniforms since Thursday, when the Taliban urged Afghan soldiers and police to turn their weapons on their Western counterparts.

The weeks events have exposed a core vulnerability of the Obama administrations strategy for winding down the decade-long Afghan war: a fraying trust between two presumed allies who must depend on each other to keep the insurgency at bay.

Although mutual suspicions have been building for some time, the Koran burnings followed by the apparent revenge killings of U.S. military personnel will make it much harder for both sides to agree in the coming weeks on the specific terms and timetable of NATOs planned withdrawal from Afghanistan by the end of 2014.
