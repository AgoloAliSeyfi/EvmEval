RUSH: That may be, folks, the most expensive prostitute in the history of prostitution, and she's bragging about it. Mary Landrieu bragging about a $300 million payoff from Dingy Harry to get her vote on this health care scam on Saturday night. Greetings. It's great to have you with us. It's Thanksgiving week and the first wave of the Limbaugh clan begin arriving this afternoon. I always look forward to this week. I look forward to this time of year, every year. It's one of my favorite times of year. Hello, folks. 800-282-2882 if you want to be on the program. The e-mail address, <a href="mailto:ElRushbo@eibnet.com">ElRushbo@eibnet.com</a>.

Let me ask you a question. How many votes did Roland Burris get for his Senate seat? How many votes did the Democrat Senator from Colorado get for his seat? Zero. They were both appointed. The Senator from Colorado, Michael Bennet, said over the weekend he would gladly lose his seat to pass health care. I told you people this. I told you the Democrats are going to thin the herd. They are gladly willing to lose members. Everybody's talking about this, "Oh, no, it's a horrible thing that happened on Saturday." Folks, it was a fait accompli. Nobody was going to vote to not do a debate. I mean, even Lieberman voted for this, and he's not going to vote for the final bill. Now, when you hear a Democrat go on television and solemnly pronounce, as Senator Ben Nelson did: "No health care if no change in public option and abortion funding," or Mary Landrieu, "I will not vote for this as it is written," they are not espousing core beliefs. They are simply opening bids.

They are simply making opening bids to Harry Reid. Mary Landrieu has now shown that she can get paid off; other people are going to have their price. So when they come along and say, "I'm not going to sign this thing as it's written. Why, I'm not going to put my signature on this! I won't vote for it if there's a public option in there. I'm not going to vote for this if there's abortion funding," that's just BS. That's a signal to Harry Reid. That's just their opening bid: "What will you give me to vote for this thing? How much will you give me to change my mind?" Who will write the escape statement: "I voted against it before I voted for it." This is classic what's going on here, and it's right out in the open for everybody to see. Let's see, who voted for this? Robert Byrd from a stretcher practically; Tim Johnson, who we're never even allowed to hear talk because he hasn't recovered from his stroke; that stooge senator who replaced Ted Kennedy. How many votes did he get? Zero. The Senator who replaced Ted Stevens, Al Franken; and that moral paragon, of course, Roland W. Burris; and Michael Bennet from Colorado. That's the Democrat who was appointed to replace Ken Salazar. A lot of no-votes guys and here they are voting on something like this and here they're going to be voting on it again when and if that vote ever takes place.

That's your problem with depending on liberal webistes that take out of context or edit.

Problem is, I'm a 24/7 member and have access TO THE ENTIRE QUOTE.

It's pretty obvious Rush is SAYING the WHOLE DAMN PARTY MALE AND FEMALE are prostituting themselves for their vote on healthcare.

Like Blago was any different trying to sell Obama's seat?

Nice try!

How exactly does that context change the meaning of the quote?

Did Rush Limbaugh actually specifically call anyone else involved a "whore" or a "prostitute"?

No, he didn't, just her.

And Schultz was also using the term slut in the context of her being a prostitute for the right-wing, not in terms of her sexual mores.

Therefore he was saying the exact same thing that Schultz was, he just used the term "prostitute" instead of "Slut", which is equally misogynist.
