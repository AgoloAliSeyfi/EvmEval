GM is the world's #1 auto producer again....WITH union labor. LOL That must REALLY piss off the Repubs who kept harping on how the unions destroyed the auto industry. Well, right back at' chuh! <img src="images/smilies/familiar/razz.png"/>

The unions sacrified and gave concessions when they had to, and despite that, management kept scratching their heads trying desperately to jettison the unions without losing THEIR jobs, and their bonuses, and their corporate jets and their golden parachutes, etc. etc. etc. They were willing to let their companies go down the tubes to get rid of the unions and then the bailouts came which saved the unions with management left denied and in denial that their plan backfired. They saw their opportunity when the economy tanked, tried to capitalize on it and had it thrown back in their faces by the (as described by the Repubs) black commie socialist foreigner would-be dictator that's destroying (their?) our nation as (they?) we know it. <img src="images/smilies/familiar/grin.png"/>

So when things went bad, the unions got the blame. Now that that things are back on track, shouldn't the unions also get the credit? Don't work that way huh? LOL

As previously mentioned, not only were the union jobs saved, but thousands and thousands of non-union jobs related to the auto industry were saved, and they vote too.

I have no idea what party/pres. candidate will win in November, but it sure don't look too good for the Repubs in that state. And it doesn't really matter what Repub gets the nod, as they were all for letting the auto makers go under....just to get the unions ousted in one clean sweep.

Nice try. Next?

It's good to see someone recogonize the auto bailouts for what they were - a bailout of the UAW (and to a lesser extent white collar management), not GM or Chrysler as a whole.

Even if GM or Chrysler had gone into liquidation their factories, tooling, IP, and skilled labor (i.e. engineers, skilled trades) wouldn't have disappeared. They would have moved on to someone who could have managed them properly. It's really the unskilled labor (assembly line workers, managers) that would have been out on their rear, and that's who was bailed out.

What is the world? Willard "Mitt" Romney says "Let Detroit go bankrupt" and the Repubs vote for him anyway? And the county where Detroit is located also voted for him? What? I don't know what is wrong with Repubs anymore. It seems like if a candidate went to a state, and said, "I hate all of you. I hope you all fail and burn in hell," that candidate would somehow win that state.

Are you trying to say Santorum is better somehow? Michigan is also considered Mitt's home state. Furthermore Detroit is not the only part of Michigan
