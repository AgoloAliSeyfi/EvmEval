I have concluded that many republicans have simply gone insane. I'm not saying that some Dem's aren't insane either, but not the same pathological egotistical insanity that now plagues the republican party, and is why they have lost so much credibility. The irony is that, though they pretend to defend this country, they are infact the ones that would cause it to go down if they had their way, because, every country would hate us, and we would be all alone and have nobody or nothing, if Republican policies were fully and comprehensibly instituted.

This post is a perfect example of moronic Americanism, fueled %100 by current republican ideology.

Has anyone else ever noticed that whenever a group asks to be accepted and granted the same rights as everyone else, the reactionary right belly aches about "Bending over backwards" to accommodate citizens and their rights? Take a look at any of the anti-Gay marriage threads. Same meme. Women's rights? Civil rights? Why the reactionaries all gripe about "bending over backwards".

I guess the rights enjoyed by the reactionaries are somehow exclusive to that group and anyone else wanting equal treatment is just an annoyance.

I love the way the left belly aches and whines for equality but when they are in control theirs no such thing. It's their way or else.

Why is it that Americans will bend over backwards to appease the Islam country's? Why is that we must walk around such issues like the 9/11 Mosque, and the Florida QurÂ’an bonfire? Is it from fear of an attack from a peaceful religion, It's a known fact they have killed Americans before without any provocation in the past. Like some of these attacks from the following link.

Some people are so devoid of knowledge they think they can win hearts and minds of Mohammedans, Anything that threatens that gossamer delusion is an act of anti American hate.

There was a failure With GW Bush directly after 9/11 to make the case specifically addressing the ideology that put into actions that ended in the piles of ruble in New York and Washington and a smoking hole in Pennsylvania.

This failure has been passed on daily.
The Acts of 9/11 were acts of fundamental Islam believers acting in accordance with the Quran and hadith.

The problem with that facts is those in "power' have no answer to combat Islam.
Since that day
Those in Power have lied continually to protect Islam from the 15000 attacks since 9/11
We have made no effort to promote the treasures of western commerce education and freedoms,we have devalued the dollar and capitalism out of existence.We had shackled our freedoms in an effort to make ourselves safe.
The Christianity has been attacked as Islam is beheld as a jewel with an unblemished history.
Our business are movie to Islamic countries and our allies begin to take US less seriously and our government walks around in clownshoes with a red nose spouting more ridicules lies about the economy, its efforts and Islam.

Soon the Government will have the full bozo suit on and the west will collapse all to protect a lies.

You might be onto something if you were not such a hack.

Everyone's a political hack who posts on this message board. Duh...

The only "hacking" done there was hacking to pieces the OP because it defines clearly the ignorant groupthink of the right wing extremists.
