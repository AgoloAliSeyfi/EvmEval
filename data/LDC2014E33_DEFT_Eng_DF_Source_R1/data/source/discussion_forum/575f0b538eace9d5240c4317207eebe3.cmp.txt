Sorry if this is really long but I have to say it all.

I've just graduated and started a Masters, obviously since a lot of my old friends graduated and moved away I've had to make a lot of new friends and it's going really well. There is one guy I met at my reception dinner, we got on really well and clicked instantly. We share the same interests, we share the same outlook on life. I also (obviously) really really fancy him.

Of course, to make these feelings even worse I have a boyfriend. We've been going out for 3 years. I love him to bits, [No you don't, stop lying to yourself] but I feel like he doesn't always appreciate me like I wish he would. [I like how girls always use this excuse instead of just admitting they just don't love their partner anymore]

Things have been a bit crap with my and my boyfriend [Proves my earlier point] the last month or so, we haven't been seeing each other [You haven't been seeing each other? This is probably the most important point because it just shows your eyes and mind are straying now that your boyfriend is out of the picture] (he moved a short distance away so we agreed to be long distance for a short while, which we have been before and it's always been fine.)

So now I'm at a loss for what to do. The guy I've fallen for I think fancies me too (it's pretty obvious and his friends have told me he does) and we go together so well, people constantly assume we're a couple when we're together. He wants a relationship and if I didn't have a boyfriend I'd date him without a doubt, and I'm pretty sure he feels the same. But of course, I do have a boyfriend. [Seems to me like you're already thinking about "what ifs"... As in, "what if I got rid of my boyfriend and dated this guy instead?" ]

I'm just suffering for what to do. I'm not a cheater and never will be [In your mind you've already cheated by longing to be with someone else, possibly flirting and getting so close to them as if you're a couple, so there's no hope for that] but I don't know how to get over this 'crush' [more like a 'heavy infatuation' ]. Should I cut the new guy out of my life completely even though I feel we could go on to be really great friends? How do I repair the relationship with my boyfriend, or should I even? I feel like my boyfriend is such a nice guy he doesn't deserve a bitch like me who feels this way <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/> [Lol, you've already said you don't think your boyfriend appreciates you and now you're saying you don't deserve him because you're a bitch? Which one is it? Make your mind up! Here's what I think: you don't love your boyfriend anymore and you wanna be with this other guy but you're making excuses to yourself like: "he doesn't deserve a bitch like me" or "he doesn't appreciate me" instead of just admitting you don't love him and you wanna be with someone else ]

Any advice? Has anyone been in this situation? I'm trying to ignore my feelings but basically I've found such a good friend and someone I click with so well and even if I never end up being his girlfriend I still want him as a friend.

I think you should stop lying to yourself and admit what you really want, rather than make feeble excuses - that's my advice. If you truly loved your boyfriend you'd immediately know what to do and you might talk to him about it - or better yet - you wouldn't start fancying another guy just because you haven't being seeing him.

EDIT: And stop trying to win the sympathy vote by constantly saying you feel like a bitch.

This is ridiculous! She's not making excuses! She's on a forum saying how she really feels and is looking for advice! Although she definitely has been a bitch! OP, like others have said, you have definitely cheated. Why do people think that just because nothing physical has happened it automatically isn't cheating! What you have done is much worse than randomly kissing a stranger at a party while drunk!

I think you should tell your boyfriend and face the consequences. You have really screwed up. Hopefully he dumps you before you hurt him even more!
