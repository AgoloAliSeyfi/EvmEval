Damn you're stupid.

No you're not right, you say every time money changes hands it gets taxed, but you fail to recognize that money earned and that has been taxed will be taxed a second time upon death per the estate tax. Your comparing money that has been earned, taxed, spent thus being earned by another party, taxed and spent again etc etc... not the same as the estate tax at all.

You fail!

And THAT is the debate being had. The 35% on amounts over $5M is the compromise, and frankly, it's a compromise that's slanted incredibly far to the right. But it just ain't good enough is it? No no, we need *NO* estate tax at all.

Tough shit. We live in a society where everyone gets a voice, and this is the current policy. Chances are it will move more to the middle over time.

And stop worrying about it... Nobody believes you're worth $5M so give it up, man!

It's funny all those on here that don't have a problem with the "estate tax" don't have a dog in the fight. I'd wager most are on the govt. dole in some fashion.

As for me I have worked for many years for the wealth I've aquired and my children should reap all the benefits, after all they're the reason I worked my ass off all these years. And for this they should be made to pay taxes on money that has already been taxed?

It's time we get every single liberal puke out of Washington and make government, the government our forefathers invisioned, which is to insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and future generations.

You aren't going to be subject to an estate tax. And if you were, I'd question your values in the claim that your little angels need more than $5 million + 65% of the wealth in excess of that. How are they ever going to learn the value of hard work just like you did?

</quote>

I'm not? Can I get a written guarantee on that?

The values my children do or do not learn is of no concern to you. Oh and you're not me.

Tell ya what; PM me. When you die, if there's an estate tax, have your kids send me the bill and I'll take care of it.

Your kids won't lose a cent to inheritance taxes, I'll wager.

And if your kids cannot make it with 100 years worth of the PRETEXED median salaries of their fellow Americans families combined, then honestly...are they even suited to having that much money to begin with?

If a scion cannot make it with $5 million TAX FREE dollars, then honestly what good does it do them (but more importantly the rest of us ) to have still more money?

The estate tax in my state starts at a million. Take your tired rethoric and lust for others wealth some where else. I hear cuba is looking for a few good communists. You would be a shoe in
