Not arguing your point - just offering my view. I think to look at as a some sort of race between who's committed more violence isn't very useful in proving anything, as in all racial groups you have people committed crimes.

Anyway what I'd point out to you is that the world is a lot better of being kind and friendly, than making adversaries. Help a person and they will thank you for the rest of their lives - scorn them and they will do the opposite for the rest of their lives. The divides between us are incredibly small, the colour of our skin, the main issue here, is just down to our exposure to a big ole thing in the sky, based on where we were born/lived. Outside of physical appearances, we're all the same - we all want the best for our parents, children, friends etc. We all love, smile, get angry.

I've lived in this country from birth, born to Bangladeshi parents- and I'm proud to admit that the generosity of all races within London has given me a bear no hate attitude even to those who attack us, and to be kind and considerate. I'm touched, because the majority of people I've interacted with are loving people. I could go onto justify what me and my family have done, but I find that superfluous and gives the feeling that we're constantly being judged. At the end of it all, we're all equals - going back to your war examples, 2 million Indians volunteered to fight for Britain in WWII after Gandhi initially refused to fight, and hundreds of thousands to a million died fighting alongside the British.

you are correct. i should calm down. but i get annoyed when i hear that the only people who have ever done wrong in history are westerners. all i see is decent and naive westerners trying their best but being battered down with these guilt trips.

my only issue with immigration is the extent of it, it is simply changing the character of the west much too quickly, and the inter race crime which seems to affect white people disproportionally. if these issues were sorted out i do not think ther would any tensions at all.

many thanks for your reply anyway. your kind attitude gives me hope that maybe in future we can all get along.

Again, no explanation. I wasn't disputing what was in the article. Clearly stating that what the person who linked it said was complete hyperbole when compared to the article. You say I'm clueless, but couldn't even comprehend that one measly sentence <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/lol.gif" alt=":lol:"/>

What, so it's okay as long as they're white?? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/lolwut.gif" alt=":lolwut:"/>
Are you genuinely ignorant enough to think that every single culture from Africa and Asia is 'backwards'?
It's quite funny hearing Britons complaining about being 'invaded' by other countries, to be honest...

Hahahaha I can't stop thinking this to be honest!!!

Very ironic.

WTF!!... in all my years i've never seen anything quite like this. That women should be ashamed of herself to even call herself "British". Absolutely disgusting.

I think it's only fair that these innocent black males should be reminded that their ilk are capable of this.

<img src="http://cdn0.wn.com/pd/0b/54/12fd20bf790fa4eb485556c5d7a1_grande.jpg"/> - The Lord's Resistance Army (they are more about African tribalism and witchcraft than the Christianity they try and affiliate themselves with, the very tribalism that causes incredibly violent london gangs such as the Peel Dem Crew, who are reknown for peeling skin off victims. I don't think any of the gang leaders are white are they? Regardless of the factuality of PDC, The Lord's Resistance Army is proof that African culture (corruption, bribery, witchcraft, rape as a form of control, killing people because they come from a different area) is something we shouldn't welcome here. I don't hate blacks, I don't hate anyone, I'm not racist thankfully I was educated beyond a smidgen. However, there are cultures that just should not be welcome here: including wahabbist teachings of pushing homosexuals of buildings. Multiculturalism is too wishy washy and we need a common denominator of culture that all agree to to be a citizen (freedom of speech, equal rights regardless of faith sexuality sex or skin colour etc). There are aspects of secondary culture (such as eating habits) that can work multiculturally if a nation wished it to be, but multiculturalism shouldn't be forced on a nation. I'm not going to make generalisations, but if only a small minority British citizens want the brutal slaughter of animals in the manner of Halal, why should we have to just put up with it?

Yes. They should equally be reminded of those atrocities too.

However, most of the 'culture' you mention is simply prohibited by English Common Law anyway. The fact that many cities in the UK may be multicultural does not change that.

Few people are mentioning that a lot of the "backward" values sported by countries such as Uganda exist because we exported Christianity there...
