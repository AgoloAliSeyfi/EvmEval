But what you did say is only possible with a machine, humans (all natural life actually) cannot be preprogrammed, and cannot be expected to be exactly the same. So, if you want them to only laugh at approved times, not fart, not make any mistakes, not bat an eye at the wrong time, not wink in the sunlight, not have a "trouser malfunction", not to anything that offends anyone... you have to have a machine, there is no other way, period.

yep! your train has left the station.

Hmm... typical it seems, all you can do is attempt to insult... yet you even fail at that since, well, it makes no sense. How is what you are asking for possible without switching to a computer for president? I'll wait for you to figure it out.

Oh, you said they should laugh at "appropriate" jokes, that means they have to be pre-approved, and you said you don't think they should "fart in public"... which means they would have to have a non-farting body, thus mechanical. The only such thing would be a computer.
