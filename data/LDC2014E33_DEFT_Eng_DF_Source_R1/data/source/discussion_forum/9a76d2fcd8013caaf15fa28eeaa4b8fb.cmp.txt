I'm not a racist but I feel like we're being completely taken over sometimes and I think we're pushovers.

When we go abroad to muslim countries we have to cover ourselves up, yet when muslims are over here (a christian country) they get to wear whatever they like and walk around with their identity completely hidden despite the problems we've had with terrorism and the fact that hoodies are often disallowed in shopping centres.

There are black/asian people in this country who think it's ok to say "I don't like white people" and there have been some seriously shocking cases lately.

I read one on here actually about a white girl who was called a 'white slag' and viciously attacked by a group of somalian muslims. They beat her up really bad (completely unprovoked) but were let off because the argument was that they were drunk and as they're muslim they aren't used to alcohol.

Reading that made me want to scream with frustration and it's things like this that fuel racism.

I don't actually care if they were born here to be honest. Racism towards white people should be taken just as seriously as racism towards black people is. It is predominantly a white country so what makes them think it's ok to come over to our country and say they don't like us? Let alone attacking us purely because we're white!

Sorry but no matter how old they are, if they're in the UK and being racist towards white people then I think they should be sent home or to where their parents are from.

LOL that gem, "I'm not racist but..."

Anyway, I am mixed race, and I think immigration needs to be brought down.

Yeah I was trying to avoid saying that to be honest lol but it sort of comes naturally to feel the need to say "I'm not racist" before saying anything that even mentions problems with immigrants because everyone's so paranoid of looking like a racist.

I think immigration levels are high, and our past pm's like gordon brown think that talking about high immigration is bigoted. i have to say i disagree.

my father comes from an immigrant background, and i dont think am bigoted for wanting to see lower immigration levels. i also think its stupid that our european friends can immigrate to britian and seek benefits, and denying them that would be against "human rights"....according to the eu court of human rights.

Am i racist and bigoted for these views ?
