Well, churches won't be forced to marry gay couples anyway. I'm pretty sure they don't even have to marry straight couples - my local Catholic church only marries people who regularly attend mass. Gay couples should be allowed to take the same secular marriage vows as straight people, and if certain churches wish to marry gay couples, like the Quakers, they should be free to do that, too. Extending the right to marry to homosexuals doesn't infringe upon the rights of anybody else or upon any religion, religious or not.

In England, the Church of England pretty much has to marry anyone who meets the residency requirements (live/born in the parish, or have a relative with some connection to the parish), all the others can pick and choose. I think if gay marriage is legalised here though, that the decision would be left down to individual churches.

Ah, I see. I don't really have much experience of the CoE, so I wasn't aware of that. But yeah, they certainly won't be forced to marry gay people.

They cannot refuse to discriminate marrying people anyway. They are part of the state. If they want to pick and choose then disestablish. Then I'll cut my hair to.5, meet up with some BNPers and form a religion to promote anti-miscegenation laws. Then we'll see how readily accepted theological excuse is for discrimination. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":cool:"/>

Churches are not simply 'old buildings' they are places of worship. For some people, like myself, they are where I take my sacraments, go to mass etc. I don't understand homosexuality, but I respect that people do not answer to me and it is not for me to judge.

However, unless a gay couple can hand on heart tell me that you are marrying but will remain celibate then I believe that such couples are mocking a mockery of the sacrament. It is the physical act that is condemned. The same goes for non-religious couples, there should a conversion and a long standing commitment to the church before a wedding is allowed to take place. Would anyone dare try this with Judaism or Islam, of course not, because they would not tolerate it and Christianity is an easy touch. Marriage is for a man and a woman for the procreation of children at its most basic level and in Christianity with a commitment before God. If he does not sanction your union and you know that you are committing a sin before you enter into the sacrament why do it? Because you can?

Is that true? What happens if the couple is infertile or the woman is post menopausal?

Does the Catholic Church insist on only marrying fertile couples who will have children?

I have absolutely nothing against homosexual people, one of my good friends is gay and he is lovely and I have total respect for him. But I do not agree that churches should allow gay marriage. Gay couples can wed elsewhere, I don't understand why they would want to marry in a place based on rules and views that disagree with their relationship. Is it just because of the fancy portrayal of church weddings in the media?

The rights of gay people should be respected, but so should be the rights of religious people and the church. If churches allow gay marriage, they are going against their views and beliefs, just to allow a gay couple to have a 'fancy church wedding'. I don't understand how it is so necessary for a gay couple to get married in a church, that the church should be forced to let go of their beliefs. It's not about modernising the church, because no matter what, churches go by the bible which will never change, and somewhere in the bible it advises against gay marriage. This will not change so gay couples should just respect christianity and steer clear of churches - unless they are actually regular church goers, I think that requires a different argument.

EDIT: I'd just thought I'd point out that my main question is what would actually draw a gay couple to marry in a church? I'm not trying to condemn homosexuality. I just don't understand because churches are against gay relationships so why would a gay couple want to wed there, unless they are trying to prove a point or something?

It's not called butting in when one tries to direct the conversation back on topic.
