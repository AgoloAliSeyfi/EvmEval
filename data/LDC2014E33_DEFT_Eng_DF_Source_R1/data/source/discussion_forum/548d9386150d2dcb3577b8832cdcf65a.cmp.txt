It is slowly recovering on its own despite Obamas policies and business crunching regulations. I am very glad it is coming around but I just wish we could vote Obama out now to expedite the process.

My prediction is that if Obama loses the election growth will double the current snails pace its growing at. In fact I bet upon the news alone that he loses the election we will start seeing firms hire and invest exponentially.

It would probably help if supposed business owners would actually work instead of posting on internet message boards. But feel free to continue blaming Obama for your failures.

You're not a useless skank...you're good for laughs.

I guess the whole "ignore" thing didn't work out. Gee, you can't run your business....little wonder you can't master an "ignore" button. LOL

I own you.

So sueing companies like Boeing because they want to build in a state his "friends" don't control is not hurting job growth? Or regulating farm dust or putting light bulb companies out of business or stopping oil drilling for so long all the platforms went to other countries instead of waiting or any other numerous stupid decision he has made.

The point is, any economic growth that Obama is inhibiting is miniscule in comparison to other factors. Rather than blaming politicians, we need to blame the state of the market.

Oh please...Obama's shut down of the gulf oil platforms cost the region well over 100,000 jobs and caused businesses to either slow their output dramatically or shut down.
Many of those jobs are NOT coming back.
The other issue is how Obama's supporters can get beyond this tragic statement.....10% unemployment is the new norm"...

BS- and did you forget the crony oil disaster that Obama handled perfectly? Boom and bust, scandalous polluters...idiocy...

Let me ask you this question....

If you were about to open a lemon aid stand...and your business plan allowed for an 8% NET profit by the end of your 3rd year...but a large personal investment to start.....

But there was word coming from Washington that the EPA, with the Presidents blessing, was going to pass new regulations on the purchasing and use of lemons....nothing concrete....nothing for sure....just word going around....

Would you dive into the venture...or wait until you knew what the EPA was going to do?

</quote>

First, I think I'd learn how to spell "lemonade".

The entire uncertainty argument is bullshit.

No it isn't...What the OP stated is 100% true.
As a matter of fact, this is an example of precisely why many businesses refuse to expand and many others are not opening.
There is no denying this. There is no factual rebuttal.
