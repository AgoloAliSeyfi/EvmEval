I get what Ron Paul is saying. Thats what a Hardcore Libertarian would say.

But the rest of us are thinking about the people that do not have insurance and/or need help right now. Kind of hard to build a house over night, Mr Paul. Kind of hard to import food considering that the stores are probably wiped out too.

How does one survive until the insurance(hopefully by a respectable company) claim comes through? How does one survive when you have the funds but the people you need to buy the goods from has no address? I know, you get into your pickup and drive over to the next town-- if you can find your damn pickup!!

Ron Paul is not opposed to private charity. So nice straw man.

</quote>

He is opposed to charity from the government. In the words of the right, a government handout.

</quote>

The government can't perform charity. It's an impossibility. The very definition of charity requires voluntariness. Charity has to be provided of one's own free will. The government, by definition, acts through the use of force to take from people. There is nothing voluntary about it.

Paul is more interested in his "states rights" issue even after a "national" disaster.

</quote>

How is it a "national" disaster?

If only one state was hit yet as much damage and death took place, would it no longer be a "national disaster" in your eyes?

Do you know what a republic is?

Do you have any idea why we are referred to as the "Unites States"?

</quote>

Oh, so now it must have the official "National" disaster label before yo uare Ok with our Federal government helping out your fellow citizens? REALLY? Wow...

</quote>

Is reading really THIS difficult?

I haven't seen any libertarian on this board or thread speak out against donating, in fact I've read the exact opposite.

Isn't it interesting how Libertarians' desire for "freedom" correspond so neatly with skinflints who don't want to give ANYONE, ANYTHING..

</quote>

Feel free to quote one of us who said nobody wants to give anyone anything. I have a feeling we'll be waiting for your reply for quite a while.

There is no reason children and teens can't understand such concepts. They will never become adults until they are treated to the same standards.

I dont see how it is government charity when the government FORCES the tax payer to give it up.

</quote>

Of course you don't. because it's not.

That is not self responsibility...

That is telling victims.....Fuck you

Sorry, but my country is not like that

</quote>

No looking to the federal government to provide a solution is telling people "fuck you."

If you really cared you would do more than just pay your taxes and look to your government for a solution every time disaster strikes.

I bet it's pretty easy to sit on your ass and point to the government..

I would call that arrogant and snug...

Paying taxes isn't good enough....

Not to mention the majority of those assholes who sit there snug, who point to the government for solutions don't pay taxes anyways..

Once again liberalism IS a mental disorder...

</quote>

Here is the way disaster relief works

If your house burns down, you are responsible for repairs along with whatever insurance and local charities wil pay

If there is a massive fire in your town, you still pay to fix your house, but the state will step in to provide additional assistance along with national charities

In a major disaster affecting a large region, the federal government steps in along with the state to provide disaster relief. National charities still provide individual assistance while the state and federal government provides grants and low cost loans to allow you to get back on your feet

</quote>

So explain this...

if my house is struck by lightening and burns down....

Why am I not afforded the government grants and low cost loans?

How does "widespread" affect anyone individually more than "one home affected"?

You see...when you hgave government pick and choose, nothing is done fairly.

When the people pick and choose, everything is done fairly.

So, you agree with Paul, that the government should have left it up to the localities to clean up their mess?

</quote>

if the government was not there to help them, I guarantee you, Americans would be there to help.

We, as a collective of individual Americans donated more money to Haiti than all other countries combined. I am not referring to Government aid that was sent....individual donations from individual Americans collectively donted more than all other populations of all other countries combined.

Our government didnt make us do it. We did it becuase we wanted to.

The problem with the left is they dont think Americans care about other people, so they feel Government needs to take our money and donate it for us.

They are wrong.

</quote>

I think that its more they don't care for other people. So they dont expect others to do something they dont themselves do. Instead they have calculated that if they look like they care about others, we will give them more power, and sadly we comply.

</quote>

Exactly, they want to look like they care, however when push comes to shove they start pointing fingers.

I suppose it's easy to talk but it's harder to act, and these twats are too fucking lazy and cheap to do a fucking thing.

As the old saying goes "talk is cheap."

It's amazing how people don't see progressives for what they are...
