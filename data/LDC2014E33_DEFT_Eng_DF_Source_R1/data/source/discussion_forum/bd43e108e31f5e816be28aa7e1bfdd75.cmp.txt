In my OH family, his Aunt had a breakdown and could no longer cope with her kids. Both were up for adoption. My OH Nan could only cope with one of the two children, and so she adopted her daughter. The child is now a lovely lady with adopted kids of her own. She called her Nan 'Mum' and her real Mum 'Aunty'. This worked out well. (Apart from the boy who was adopted, as it was a double rejection for him. Although they made contact this was not able to be maintained <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/frown.gif"/> )

If I were you I would definitely take the child, but put some serious ground rules in place so that I was the Mum figure and not SIL. Her behaviour has meant she no longer has the privilege of being the primary carer. This arrangement can't be a situation where she still gets to be 'Mum' but you do all the work. That would be terrible. I think even the most unconventional families can work well together. Good luck with your decision, it's a really difficult one and I think everyone would understand and respect your decision either way.

Am I being naive with the whole care thing? a lot of you seem to think its the worst of the worst?

I have a friend who was adopte at birth and had a wonderful life, he refuses to trace his birth parents.

I'd assume/hope it wouldn be the same for the baby?

I don't have any children, but I may be able to offer advice from a more balanced perspective?

From what I've read, it sounds like you already know what the best choice for you to make is. Your SIL seems to be putting pressure on you to take the child so that she can still see it - and if s/he got taken away at birth, there must be a pretty good reason as to why she's not allowed to do so!

Additionally, you say you want children of your 'own', and I know how you feel. It sounds stupid, but for example, when I moved in with my boyfriend, he had a cat. Me and the cat got on and I liked the cat, but then we adopted a kitten and I'm much more attached to it than the older cat because it's 'mine' if that makes sense? I don't think your feelings will change as time passes, especially not with your SIL coming round all the time.

It's really unfair that they're pressuring you to take it in - don't cave! Like someone else said, if you don't take it and it's put up for adoption, it will be adopted by someone who really, really wants a baby, not taken in by someone because of a sense of family duty. I think by saying no, you will be doing both yourself and the baby a favour.
