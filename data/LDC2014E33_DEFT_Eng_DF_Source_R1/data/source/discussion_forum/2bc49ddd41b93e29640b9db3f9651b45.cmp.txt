I am a conservative Republican who is going to vote for Obama this election.

And no, he hasn't done Jack for the country and I am totally at odds with his liberal socialist agenda.

So why would I vote for him and encourage others to pull the lever for Obama?

Because after he wins the election he can tell AIPAC to stuff it.

Then I believe he will be the first setting American to read the riot act to Israel and it's fascist government.

Not having to worry about re-election will allow Obama the freedom to throw off the Zionist slave chains that are wrapped around the presidency.

Placing America first; and Israel a far distance second.

Obama taking this patriotic stance is far more important for our nation's security and safety than any other single issue or threat we face as a freedom loving people.

Voting for a man with so much muslm blood on his hands, sad.

But I agree with GHook, the "Obama hates Israel and jews" blather is brought to us by the Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson type of republicans. The ones who only debate with emotion and hysterics and aren't trying to make a point, just trying to get attention and the "wow" factor.

Debt, deficits, Obamacare, garbage economy, plenty of legitimate reasons to hate Obama. No need to drum up emotional diatribe.

Blaming him for debt,deficits or the economy is as bad.

I am an Israel supporter and people would call as a Republican and I am very much against Obama's vision for America! That said, a label that is being tossed at Obama CONSTANTLY is that he is antiIsrael. I used to buy it, but now I see it only as propaganda against him. His actions speak louder than other people's words!

Look at his record:
(1) Obama hasn't stopped the military aid and won't even consider it!
(2) Obama hasn't imposed any sanctions on Israel and FIGHTS them if presented with them.
(3) He defends Israel in every growing Muslim pandering (because of the growing Muslim population) and antisemitic Europe.
(4) Obama has protected Israel in the antiIsrael UN.
(5) Obama has pushed tough sanctions on Iran and has taken a strong stance against them. He has done something Bush has done and got Europe on board with his policy.
(6) Obama stated in ISLAMIC COUNTRIES that the bond btw American and Israel is unshakable.
(7) Obama has provided funds for the Iron Dome.
(8) Imports from Israel have increased under Obama.
(9) Obama is killing terrorist and fighting the war on terror with vigor.
(10) He has sold high tech military warplanes to Israel and is committed to Israel's military tech edge.

So Obama talks bad about the so-called "Settlements" (which is a bullshit argument in the end), well in this PC antisemitic world he needs to in order to save face around the world, esp the antisemitic Saudis, Egyptians and Europeans. So he insulted Bibi. Bibi seems like an asshole. He insulted the man not the country. I am sure there are countries around the globe insulting Obama, but are not antiAmerican! He is not bad for Israel and he isn't even close to antiIsrael. He is bad for America and the American economy and that is what we need to care about!

So Please Stop Pelting The Obama AntiIsrael Propaganda!!!

You guys realize that when you have rabid anti-Obama RWers with Obama-Derangement Syndrome like Ghooks making public statements like this means that the GOP is toast this election right?

I mean, if you haven't noticed, Obama's been systematically removing all possibilities of RW talking points and attacks against him and the left with his Presidency. They can't call him weak, ask Osama and Khadaffi...and the pirates, they can't call him Anti-Israel, for the things just said, they can't call him anti-guns, we've never experienced more gun freedom and loose laws concerning them, the list goes on.

Thinking America recognizes this already, and the fold will only grow.

Keep up the rabid squeaking and squawking about Obama RWers....let me know how that works out for you on Nov. 2.

Actually....I see this adminstaration taking an approach to Israel as we should be taking.

For years we treated Israel like it was the end all.....Sure, they are a great ally....but no more important to us than our other allys...and on the most part, our other allys respect us...and we respect them...and that is where it ends....we dont treat any of them like they are on a pedestal...and we shouldnt with Irsrael.

This adnministration is heeding to its responsibilities as an ally of Israel, but not putting it on a pedestal.

So what is this adminstratiuon doing? Treating Israel like another ally...and nothing more.
