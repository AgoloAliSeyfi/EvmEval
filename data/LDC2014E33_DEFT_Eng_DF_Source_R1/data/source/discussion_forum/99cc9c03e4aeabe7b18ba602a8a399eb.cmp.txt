Let's look at what the US EPA says on its site:

<quote>
Scientists know for certain that human activities are changing the composition of Earth's atmosphere. Increasing levels of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide (CO2 ), in the atmosphere since pre-industrial times have been well documented. There is no doubt this atmospheric buildup of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is largely the result of human activities.
</quote>

<quote>
Nevertheless, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stated there was a "discernible" human influence on climate; and that the observed warming trend is "unlikely to be entirely natural in origin." In the most recent Third Assessment Report (2001), IPCC wrote "There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities."
</quote>

<quote>
As atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases continue to rise, scientists estimate average global temperatures will continue to rise as a result. By how much and how fast remain uncertain. IPCC projects further global warming of 2.2-10째F (1.4-5.8째C) by the year 2100. This range results from uncertainties in greenhouse gas emissions, the possible cooling effects of atmospheric particles such as sulfates, and the climate's response to changes in the atmosphere.

The IPCC states that even the low end of this warming projection "would probably be greater than any seen in the last 10,000 years, but the actual annual to decadal changes would include considerable natural variability."

<quote>
IPCC cautions, "Complex systems, such as the climate system, can respond in non-linear ways and produce surprises."
</quote>

The fundamental scientific uncertainties are these: How much more warming will occur? How fast will this warming occur? And what are the potential adverse and beneficial effects? These uncertainties will be with us for some time, perhaps decades.

<quote>
Global warming poses real risks. The exact nature of these risks remains uncertain. Ultimately, this is why we have to use our best judgement - guided by the current state of science - to determine what the most appropriate response to global warming should be.

Human activity has been increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (mostly carbon dioxide from combustion of coal, oil, and gas; plus a few other trace gases). There is no scientific debate on this point. Pre-industrial levels of carbon dioxide (prior to the start of the Industrial Revolution) were about 280 parts per million by volume (ppmv), and current levels are about 370 ppmv. The concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere today, has not been exceeded in the last 420,000 years, and likely not in the last 20 million years. According to the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES), by the end of the 21st century, we could expect to see carbon dioxide concentrations of anywhere from 490 to 1260 ppm (75-350% above the pre-industrial concentration).

Large and rapid climatic changes affecting the atmospheric and oceanic circulation and temperature, and the hydrological cycle, occurred during the last ice age and during the transition towards the present Holocene period (which began about 10,000 years ago). Based on the incomplete evidence available, the projected change of 3 to 7째F (1.5 - 4째C) over the next century would be unprecedented in comparison with the best available records from the last several thousand years.

Over a 40 year period, scientist Charles Keeling measured the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. The above "Keeling Curve" shows the increase in total concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere from 1957-1997. This unbroken record of the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere shows how it's gone up, in round numbers, from around 315 parts per million to around 370 parts per million on average today. This data is widely accepted by everyone.

Graph showing a 450,000 year record of carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the earth's atmosphere. This record was compiled from analyzing bubbles of fossilized air trapped in ice cores. The fossilized air shows the levels of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere throughout this 450,000 period. The last 100-150 years of the 20th Century show a significant rise in CO2.

Now, let's acknowledge in this discussion that there has been a large and very well funded campaign established and run by industry interests to denigrate climate change as a 'hoax', or as reflecting the views of 'radicals', or as a set of theories which have 'no consensus' in the science community, or as 'junk science', etc. Each of those claims is a lie, or at the very least, a serious misrepresentation (see data above).

Let's also acknowledge that this campaign is reflected in Bush administration statements and policies (commenting on his own science council conclusions that GW was real, and that human activity was an undoubted causal factor, Bush said "Yes, I'm familiar with what those bureaucrats said.") We'll note that the Texas Republican Party Platform of 2000 states, "We oppose...the theory of global warming."

And, let's acknowledge that such comments/opinions are forwarded broadly across the right wing media.

Finally, let's acknowledge that the publication of Lomborg's book was followed by Science Journal, Nature Journal, and Scientific American ALL releasing special editions presenting the problems and errors in Lomborg's analyses. For both of these scientific journals, the most significant science journals published in English, such a special edition on a single contemporary issue, was unprecedented.
