Tax policy should not be fair. No one can agree on the definition of 'fair'. The government should just tax those who can't do anything about it. That would be anyone with an addiction (booze,gambling,sex, tobacco,reality TV audiences...etc) and all left handed people named 'Doug'.

Not mad at all. You're just wrong. No one wants to make us "all the same". That's just your typical brainwashed bullshit that I hear all the time from the right. You ask ANY progressive on here that same question and I doubt you'd even get a positive response from ONE of them.

No one said the rich can't be so. That's just Rush Beckbaugh talking to your ignorant ass.

And that's always the lefts excuse for denying what they really are. Believe it or night most people on the right don't get weekly marching orders from Beck or Limbaugh. Do you see me accusing you of being a Michael Moore or Paul Krugman parrott?

The left wants equal outcomes. How do I know that? Look at the policies they push for. Giving more and more for the poor and taking more and more from the rich. Are you really trying to deny that? How can such policies result in anything but an equally mediocre society? Freedom and safety are opposites where government is concerned. The more you you gain of one the more you lose of the other and the simple fact is liberals value security more than freedom. We can all strive for risk free lives, but keep in mind that is going to curtail the ability of anyone person to succeed much beyond another and believe it or not there are benefits to members of society defining and achieving measures of success as defined by themselves rather than government.

No... we just want a fair day's pay for a fair day's work... adjusted for inflation and cost of living. Simple as that. Unfortunately... the only people that get to decide what that fair day's pay is... is the people who don't want to give a fair day's pay. wrong. Work ethic makes that decision You even want MORE of the same... you applaud every time everyday workers lose their right to organize. correct becuase we are seeing how unions protect those with the least acceptable work etyhic at the expense of those with the best possible work ethic You applaud every time the jobs go overseas.... because it's "their right" to do that. wrong...we applaud America as a land of freedom of choices You applaud the gross tax evasion that those same entities are allowed to commit because "they are just trying to keep what is theirs" I never applauyd anyone who breaks the law.. All hail the Plutocracy! Fuck the country, fuck the shrinking Middle Class, fuck the elderly, fuck the kids and most of all... fuck the poor. I dont know man...I look at the poor in the US and I gotta tell ya...let them see what the poor live like in any other country and I bet they wouldnt be complaining. The ONLY people you feel are worthy of anything are the rich. Everyone else can go scratch their asses.

I don't give a flying fuck how much other people have It seems quite apparent that is ALL you care about... but when a vast number of the people in this country can barely afford to keep a roof over their heads, really? Where? Sure, things are tight right now.....but you see an ever growing homeless situation happening? How many people do you hear about starving to death???? their families fed and pay their monthly utilities, then you see reports on how the rich keep hauling money in at a record pace... well, if you can't see the fucked up nature of that... all talking points..and it is making you sound foolish then you are too indoctrinated to even debate with.

Finally... the left's excuse for "denying what they are"? What... are you going to throw the "M" word out? I am not a fuckin' Marxist... that's more of your brainwashed propaganda against the vast majority of our population... you know... the people who do the wealthy's dirty work and get shit on at every turn?

Tax shelters are a thing of the past.
Tax deductions for children help everyone
Write off of mortgage interest help the less wealthy afford homes....and are invariably offset by the real estate taxes they have to pay
Tax deferred investments are income that are ultimately taxed.

I am curious what loopholes exist that you are referring to.

</quote>

asterism has explained it very well but I would add...

People still seem to think this is about INCOME tax. Its not. Never has been.

Ultimate loophole of all time is that WEALTH is taxed at a much lower rate than income. Ultra-wealthy hide wealth and therefore pay no tax on it.

GET IT?

</quote>

You are aware that "wealth" as opposed to income has already been taxed when it WAS income, correct?

The US can not operate a nice welfare/warfare state state with that attitude!!!!!!!!

I disagree. Taxes can be entirely fair by assessing the same user fee to everybody who uses a service or product or government program.

If we go the income route, a tax can be entirely fair by assessing the same proportional percentage to ALL income regardless of socioeconomic standing.

The only way taxes will be 'fair' is when they are not used to control, discipline, or manipulate people and/or the economy. Taxes should be collected to run the NECESSARY functions of government and for nothing else.
