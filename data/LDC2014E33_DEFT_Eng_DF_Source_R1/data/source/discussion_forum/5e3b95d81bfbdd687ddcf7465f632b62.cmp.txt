By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press  15 minutes ago
WASHINGTON (AP)  House Republicans put aside their usual antipathy toward President Barack Obama on Wednesday to give the president, and his successors, the line-item veto, a constitutionally questionable power over the purse that long has been sought by presidents of both parties.

A minority of Democrats joined in casting a 254-173 vote in favor of allowing the president to pick out specific items in spending bills for elimination. Currently, the chief executive must sign or veto spending bills in their entirety.

The main opposition came from members of the Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for putting together the annual spending bills. They argued that the bill upsets the constitutional separation of powers balance in favor of the executive branch, and that recent efforts to curtail so-called earmarks in spending bills make the line-item veto unnecessary.

The bill now goes to the Senate, where its prospects are uncertain.

23. That's the smell of corporate supremacist authoritarianism.

They want to turn the United States in to a corporation and one surefire way to do it, is for the people's representatives to abdicate their responsibilities and power to a dominating CEO/President.

43. Why not? It's not a question of Republicans vs Democrats it's a question

of politicans in the right wing leaning, authoritarian quadrant of the political spectrum vs those closer to the libertarian point of view, Obama has given the authoritarians no reason for concern, he's one of them.

The Republicans know that even if Obama were to win reelection, the corporate media will still continue to enable and depict poltiicians in the right wing, authoritarian quadrant as being the "moderates," "centrists," "mainstream" to power whether it be in the White House or the Congress.

Even if Obama were to surprise them and deviate from authoritarianism, the long term dynamic would be set to correct itself.

The peoples' representatives in Congress would be weakened and subjugated to a central figure; the same one which can on his/her authority alone have any American killed or imprisoned indefinitely as Donald Trump would say, that American is fired.

In short, another major step toward corporate supremacy over the people and "We the people's" government.

47. Because they are counting on a GOP Presidency.

All the more reason to work hard to put a Dem Congress in place. The Dems should cede no state and work hard in all of them.

2. I asked my forer rep many years ago

that if this were passed, what the hell would the House do? Seems like they gave all their power away.
He was so stunned he couldn't answer.

It erodes checks and balances. Was he part of this vote?

42. he was defeated in 2006 by a damned good democrat

the former rep was Jim Leach who achieved this kind of mythical status as a "reasonable Republican." He was no more than any other Republican.

His lasting legacy is as the "Leach" in "Gramm-Leach-Bliley" bill that repealed Glass-Stegall

I started asking him about the budget in 2004 as the Bush deficits mounted and he would never answer me.
At one of his town halls he made this incredible statement about how great line item veto would be. I interrupted and said "If the President controls the budget, what does congress do?" He was stunned, mumbled a bit and asked for other questions.

48. Oh, that was beautiful!

The look on his face must have been priceless.

I hope one day we can put his little namesake bill into the dustbin of history as a 'failed experiment'.

I found out he doesn't like to be questioned and was usually ill-prepared.

17. actually, I believe that they found this unconstitutional, back in the 90s

seems like the repugs like to put this on the bill in a Presidential election year when they think they can get the President away from a Dem.

When it passed (1996), and Clinton was re-elected, the SCOTUS found the legislation "unconstitutional"...

Wouldn't surprise me if the SCOTUS would find it "unconstitutional" again... if Obama is re-elected.

Don't have any history on whether or not the SCOTUS would find it unconstitutional if a Repug won...

33. Yes, this held unconstitutional.

Personally, I think that Kennedy would join the liberal wing, if, in fact, this thing ever got to the SC.

34. Clinton v. City of New York

6-3, Breyer dissented, Kennedy concurred.

Just google the name of the decision or "line item veto supreme court" to pull up quite a bit of information.

Then, I thought, maybe I was imagining things and it hadn't been tried before! Thanks for confirming it for me.

6. Hopefully

The Senate will vote this down. I don't care who is president, the line item veto is a massive transfer of power from the legislature to the executive.

On a tactical level it also destroys any impetus for compromise within a legislative body as it means that any concessions and compromises reached will merely be crossed off by the president of one party or another.
