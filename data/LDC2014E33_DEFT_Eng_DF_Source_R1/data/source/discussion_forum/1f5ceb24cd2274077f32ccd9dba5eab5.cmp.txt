It begins and ends with Romneycare. If Obama never pushed Obaminationcare, then Romney would be running away with the nomination!

Funny he was considered the most conservative option in 2008! Rush, Levin, Hannity, Savage etc all said Romney was the conservative candidate. Fast forward to 2012 and now he is the liberal candidate. Nothing change, EXCEPT the passing of Obaminationcare!

I think you draw the wrong interpretation of 2008.

He wasn't the most conservative, Huckabee was.

And Huckabee was sincere.

What you forget about all those talking heads is that they are all paid by big corporations. The real problem is that Corporate Conservatism and Social Conservatism aren't on the same page.

The big corporations don't give a shit about Abortion or Gay Marriage or gettin' Jay-a-zus into your life. They just want laws friendly to Wall Street, and Romney is that guy.

Huckabee actually believed in all that Jay-a-zus shit, and that scared the corporate guys.

Here's the ugly little truth. The religious right could win elections without the corporate right. Easily. They'd even have an easier time of it, because a lot of religious people vote Democrats and aren't fooled into voting against their own economic interests.

One of the most lucid, reasonable descriptions of Romney I've seen yet, well done.

The guy is awkward and doesn't connect. There are obviously plenty of people like that, it doesn't make you evil, but it's obviously a significant handicap when you're running for President. Add that to the fact that he just seems so eager to please, and you have a guy who isn't easy to trust.

What? Liberals are finding something wrong with Romney? Unbelievable!

If you want to pretend that Romney is perfect, okay, your call, I see it with partisans on both sides all the time. It is possible, however, to admit weaknesses in candidates from your party without being arrested. It is possible to be reasonable and honest, too.

Read the post I made right after that one.

As I'm pretty sure that the OP was asking Republican voters, I will answer. Keep in mind that even though I'm a registered Republican I am decidedly Libertarian.

Romney has a credibility issue with me. Even after I put aside all the things that I disagree with him on (Me, being a Libertarian) I just cannot trust him to do the things I would expect of a Republican. I am not convinced that he will repeal obamacare, I am not convinced that he will reduce government spending, and I am not convinced that he will run the country like a businessman. Having followed the last 2 presidential races, (9 in total) I am familiar with Romney, and familiar with what he says compared to wht he has done and what he has said.

That's what is wrong with Romney, and what is right about Romney is that with all his faults, he's 10 times better than obama.

why would you think the o/p is asking "republicans". i've voted republican enough times where i'm probably the better gauge. just sayin

thank you though for pointing out what the real problem is... it's the rightwingnut base and the difficulties of appealing to it if one is a normal moderate person.

btw, you aren't a libertarian if you're anti-choice.

just sayin

Jumping with both feet right into a pile of bull shit aren't you.

I am and have always been pro-choice all the way accross the board. In every area, I am pro choice, pro freedom. Which makes me an enemy of obama.
