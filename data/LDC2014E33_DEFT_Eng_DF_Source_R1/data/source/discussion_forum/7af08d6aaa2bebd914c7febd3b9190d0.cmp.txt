Creaking and groaning but some steps forward globally - apparently Mexico did a great job stick handling the various issues to bring about an agreement. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/clap.gif"/>

A Comeback in Cancun: Countries Move Forward with Climate Agreement

December 11, 2010
Location: CANCUN, MEXICO

Jennifer Morgan, director of WRI's Climate and Energy program

The Cancun climate talks concluded today with countries agreeing by consensus to move ahead with an international agreement on climate change.

Following is a statement from Jennifer Morgan, director of the climate and energy program at the World Resources Institute (WRI):

Modest expectations gave way to promising results, as the Cancun climate meeting wrapped up with a new but fragile international climate agreement. Under the watchful eye and strong management of the Mexican presidency, delegates agreed to establish a platform for international climate action, while recognizing that much more needs to be done to tackle climate change.

This agreement was a remarkable turnaround for a multilateral approach to address climate change, including commitments on emissions from all the worlds major economies.

By consensus, countries agreed to a balanced package that includes targets and actions, increased transparency, the creation of a climate fund, and other important mechanisms to support developing countries. Delegations also recognized the urgency of keeping global average temperature below 2 degrees Celsius, with the ability to strengthen the response in the coming years.

Over the next year, countries will have to work to resolve many complex challenges. The agreement did not resolve the issue of legal form, leaving that to be determined in the future. Countries must also further develop the climate fund to ensure developing countries receive financial support through an effective and transparent mechanism to assist with adaptation, reduction of emissions from deforestation, and de-carbonization efforts.

Ultimately, the world will need to take bolder steps to tackle the challenges of climate change. On its current pace, global temperatures will exceed 2 degrees Celsius, leaving people more vulnerable to severe droughts, melting glaciers, and rising seas, along with more extreme weather events around the world.

Countries must build on the momentum at Cancun to deliver real change on the ground in response to the growing threat of climate change.

In Bob Woodward's book he quotes Obama saying in their interview that another 9-11 style attack on the USA does not bother him. Our president says that the USA could absorb another such attack. He says that a nuclear attack from terrorists is what troubles him.

Well, humanity can stand some global warming. Another ice age, or worse yet, a snowball earth, is what we should really be concerned with.

One gets alot of press, the other does not. That does not mean one is more deadly just because everyone talks about it.

I make his post now because it just so happens that there is a link today on space.com's website to a story about snowball earth.

Better yet, the current greenhouse is PREVENTING another ice age.

So, what have we all learned? I will tell you. We have learned that I am correct. Thank you for your kind admiration. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/tongue.gif"/>

Sorry. Is this a reply to my post #755? <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/confused.gif"/>

I'd like you to provide some material about the benefits of anthropogenic (or not) global warming or endorse any you can find among the +10,000 posts about GW in this forum.

So far I understand you take an extreme cold scenario, present it as a menace and use verbal means to argue for warm scenarios generated by human actions or a restraint on human actions in a way I understand as a sort of intelligent design applied to climate.

For instance, you may provide data about the economical benefit of a raise in average temperature of, say, 1 degree Celsius. You also may clarify and backup bold claims like the above "Better yet, the current greenhouse is PREVENTING another ice age."

Speaking of getting more obvious....the Arctic is where the impact was predicted to have greater effect....

Obvious indeed, it's like predicting the flip of a coin won't land on it's side. I'm not seeing your reason for pointing this out <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/confused.gif"/>
