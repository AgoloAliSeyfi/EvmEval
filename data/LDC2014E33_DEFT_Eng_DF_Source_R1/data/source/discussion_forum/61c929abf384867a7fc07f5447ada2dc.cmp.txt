Linkat....sorry to be appearing a little dense here, I understand the law of supply and demand, but I must be missing one of your points.

Back on page 9 I posted the example of McDonalds (can be anyplace) giving 45 employees at a store a.50 hr raise....that's less than $180 a day increase in payroll (taking SS out of the employer equation for simplicity). An average Mcdonalds serves over 1500 people a day. You'd be spreading that $180 over 1500 people.

In my eyes I'm seeing 45 people making an extra $20 a week, and a customer coming in once a week spending about a dime and a nickel extra.

People working for minimum wage are producing a large number of product or service. The extra cost is diluted by the large numbers of those paying for each unit.

Many of the products minimum wage workers produce are items they wouldn't even able to afford if they made a couple dollars an hour more. So the cost going up for those items wouldn't even effect them.

If I'm producing blouses that cost $50 each, I'm not going to be able to afford them whether I make $5.50 hr or $7.50. However, the person who can an does purchase such items would still pay the additional dollar or two it costs.

Also, I noted in my other post that these people are interchangable cogs. Just because they could theoretically get a job paying a few pennies more elsewhere, quite often there's other stuff involved that just doesn't fit into a neat equation, preventing them from making the move.

Maybe a person works the night shift, husband works days, so the kids are always cared for....the higher paying job across the street tells you that they can't start you on the night, but will give you that shift when it comes up....but it never does, or it doesn't for 2 weeks. Now, you had all that extra child care money going out. Then, on top of it, you're worry about how you're going to come up with the money, you're not paying attention to work....and you get fired.

Sometimes our big brains and plans get in the way of reality.

Anyway, can you make that supply and demand thing a little clearer, based on what I'm saying?

Great thread though Linkat, most interesting I've read recently. Thanks.

number of working population
30 Million people may be 10% of the TOTAL population (we're almost there at 300m), but it is NOT the number of working population. That is the number we need.

From U.S. Dept of Labor

How large is the labor force?

The labor force, then, is not a fixed number of people. It increases with the long-term growth of the population, it responds to economic forces and social trends, and its size changes with the seasons. On average in 2000, there were roughly 135 million employed and 6 million unemployed making up a labor force of 141 million persons. There were about 69 million persons not in the labor force.

And this from another site

" That said, there are not too many minimum wage jobs in our economy. Depending on whose figures you use, somewhere between about 1/2 of one percent, and three percent of all jobs held by adults pay minimum wage. Minimum-wage jobs are unevenly distributed with rural areas seeing higher percentages of minimum-wage workers in the workforce than urban areas. On a practical level, most potential workers would rather cobble together a mix of sporadic part-time work, assistance program benefits, and unreported income derived from the shadow economy, than take a full-time minimum wage job. But it's critical to note that minimum wage sets the floor above which all the other jobs set compensation levels to compete for workers. When the minimum wage goes up, it exerts upward pressure on the next few levels up, where a great many Americans are employed."

Age structure of the US:

0-14 years: 20.4% (male 31,095,847/female 29,715,872)
15-64 years: 67.2% (male 100,022,845/female 100,413,484) 65 years and over: 12.5% (male 15,542,288/female 21,653,879) (2006 est.)

It's about 200.5 million or 2/3ds of the US population who represents "working age," but we're not sure how many of those are a) stay at home spouse, b) disabled, or c) students.

Census and Labor Statistics
From listing on US Census Bureau fact page:

<a href="http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/SAFFFacts?_submenuId=factsheet_0&amp;_sse=on">http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/SAFFFacts?_submenuId=factsheet_0&amp;_sse=on</a>

As of 2000, individuals below poverty level number 33,899,812 consisting of 12.4% of the Labor force

I mention this here because THESE are the people who are most affected by the minimum wage law. These people are the ones whose lives are greatly affected by the fat, rich politicians who see nothing wrong with increasing their OWN salaries at the drop of a hat and under the cover of darkness.

How congress voted to help the middle class:

Who needs a middle class anyway?
May 21, 2004 1:22 PM PST
Middle-Class 2003: How Congress Voted (executive summary) Who is doing better under the a Republican White House and Congress? If you're part of the vast majority...the middle class...it isn't you.

So finds a very useful new report out today from the Drum Major Institute for Public Policy, a non-partisan think tank. Full report here. (PDF) The study defines middle class as Americans with incomes between approximately 200 percent of the federal poverty threshold and those of the top 5 percent of earners -- roughly $25,000 to $100,000 a year. (Which excludes Congresscritters, who have consistently given themselves raises to well over 150k a year.)
