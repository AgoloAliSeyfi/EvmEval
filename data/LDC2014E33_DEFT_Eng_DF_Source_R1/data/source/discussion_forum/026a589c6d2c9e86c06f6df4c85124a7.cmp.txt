C'mon...grow up.

You angry leftists are so quick to throw not only the 'racist' accusation, but the word 'lie'.

Now, here you are challenged to prove the lie charge, and you are unable to do so.

Were I a leftist, I would, of course, accuse you of 'lying' with your charge, as it is clear that the video provided in post #14 is in no way a lie, nor could you misunderstand my post which indicated that the vid was dispositive as to Fox being fair.

So, I'll simply leave you with the brand of immature, angry, sophomoric, spittle-spewing, left wing janissary, infused with the desire to paint opponents with vituperation, rather than banter about the value of each others' ideas.

There, now, isn't that more literate than 'lying racist'...

I do hope after your rant, you will proceed to answer my question: What was Mr. Brietbart's intention in posting only the portion of the Sherrod video which seems to indicate she is spewing nothing but racist comments? Was it, gasp, a desire to paint opponents (particularly black people) as angry racists?

What is Limbaugh's or Beck's "intent" when they take some innocuous comment uttered by someone in the Obama administration, or the president himself, and create an entire show about it?

Mr. Brietbart made his agenda clear when he began his website, i.e. to counter the multitude of left wing sites and publications.
He is doing just that.

Now, as for "a desire to paint opponents (particularly black people) as angry racists," this bit of projection on your part has given a glimpse into your attitude, mind, and agenda.

Moving on..."What is Limbaugh's or Beck's "intent" when they take some innocuous comment uttered by someone in the Obama administration,..." how lucky we Americans are to have the antidote to the left wing propaganda to which you subscribe.

The irony is that you have misused the word innocuous, which means "Having no adverse effect; harmless" and inadvertently, once again, shown who you are.

In my America it is hardly innocuous to have a self-proclaimed communist selected by the President, and another who looks to Mao for guidance in the same select group...again chosen by the President.

Perhaps a better strategy for you would have been to use President Obama's defense for his numerous missteps, as I believe he said early in his failed presidency, "Elections have consequences..."

That means that "I can put communists, loony scientists like Holdren, AG's who won't prosecute blacks if the victim is white, Medicare chiefs who plan on redistributing the wealth, or State Department officials who announce that the Arizona law is equivalent to Chinese human rights abuses..."

That's what 'elections have consequences' means....

and I don't see anything innocuous in the above.

How'd ya like that rant?

Loony scientists? Perfect, coming from the right, who depend on EVERYTHING they eat, wear, touch, see, listen too or live in from those "loony left wing scientists". Rich.

anyone notice how it is that every lefty IS ALWAYS THE POOR POOR VICTIM.

and of course it not ever their fault, as it's now FOX NEWS, THE RIGHTIES, BLAA BLAA BLAA.

lefties are either constantly OUTRAGED OR THE POOR VICTUM.

all together now.........awwwwwwwww

Nobody in the media pays any attention to Republican shenanigans, that's why. The guy running for Governor of Colorado, for example, caught plagiarizing then blaming someone else for it. How much air time did that get? If it had been a Dem, and if it had happened even six months ago, we'd still be seeing it recycled by Republican bloggers. Hell, they're even still talking about Biden's plagiarizing a college thesis 40 years ago!!

Conservatives have the loudest voices this political cycle, and I know why. Do you?

It's because the right, that party of "morals", don't have "low" standards. They have "No" standards.
