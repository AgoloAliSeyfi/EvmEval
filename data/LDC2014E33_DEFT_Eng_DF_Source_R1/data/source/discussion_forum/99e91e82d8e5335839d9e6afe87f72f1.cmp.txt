This reminds me of a situation that happened to me a while ago that shows the apathy of even the police. ( warning, read completely, for my sake, lol.)

It was new years and me and some friends were at the bar, a female made her way over and started to hit on the lot of us ( 3 gents in total.), one friend was not into anything of that nature, but me and the other were good to go.

Now she was drunk, but no more than us, ( or so we thought) and she was rather up front about what she was looking for. It was snowy, terrible, and none of us had coats ( and i found my cab money has disapeared.). So we started a rather long walk across town.

Now half way there she starts acting very erratic, getting intensely angry, not being able to stand, then getting really happy ( also unable to stand.), keep in mind it was around 2 am, so frequently we were telling her to not yell so loud, etc.

Now, i inquired and found out that she did large doeses of prescription drugs, and they had just started to kick in. So the plan changed from what it was, to getting her somewhere so she didn't wander off in the snow and die.

Now, while i know we were doing good, think of what this would look like to onlookers.

3 gents, seemingly dragging a very inebriated girl around saying things to the nature of " Just shut up" ( in relation to her loud screaming of odd, or vulgar things.). I personally thought we would get stopped at some point and have a long awkward explination.

But not so much, people looked, some people almost came over, but no one did anything.

Even when we walked by a female cop, and she jokingly said, loudly something about being kidnapped. The cop was about to come over, but decided against it.

I just don't get it, if the people were wrong, it would just have been a laugh, nothing big except for some wasted time, and awkwardness. But what if we were planning something bad and taking her against her will? ( which, it really would have seemed.)

Sometimes i just don't get people.

( as a post script, upon getting back to my friends place, she proceeded to puke violently, and then, of all things, still try and push for the threeway. Seeing as she was completely out of her mind, though very energetic, i spent a couple of hours convincing her it was a bad idea, and that, at least, she should wait to sober up a bit to make that decision. Thankfully that pissed her, off and she ended up getting a safe way home with our third buddy. )

hmmm, you know, this would actually be a problem for me. I live bordered by Boston College on one side of my neighborhood and Boston University and the other, on the main street, and in a bar heavy neighborhood. And just in general, I live in Boston, which is filled with college students, Irish, and Italians. If I stopped a group of people everytime I saw some guys dragging around a drunk girl shouting vulgarities, that's all I'd be doing every Friday and Saturday night.

Good idea, although I'm betting initially you would assume innocence and need one heckuva a case and a LOT of evidence to be swayed otherwise. And there is little evidence in this right now. There are accusations and testimonials only. Strong stuff but IMO not nearly enough to *BANG* stop or I'll shoot.

I just think it would have been nice/advisable to have this go to court and KNOW what's what before people started throwing molotov cocktails every which way.

You don't seem to have read the grand jury paper - in that he stated that he was informed of (at least) a matter of inappropriate sexual activity. I condemn him based on his own testimony.

On the internet, everone is Bruce Lee with an uzi. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/>

It is soooo easy to sit here all comfy behind a computer with the luxury of hindsight and chit chatter away about I woulda done the exact right thing at the exact right time blah blah blah. But when something this shocking blindsides you in an instant, FYI it might not be so easy/simple and being human you might not take the best path.

I do not excuse anyone in this situation who didn't, btw. Just something to think about.

Sandusky was not one of this staff.

oops, sorry, I threw another fact in there. I keep forgetting they don't matter in this issue.

As I understand, he was on the staff when the first incident happened.

BTW I'm amused by this part, because I don't have the impression that you're fact-oriented. Just the opposite actually.

Oh, those poor kids men. So shocked and disoriented by what was seen and reported that they could hardly get it together to plan their 81 football games between the incident and last weekend.

I just feel horrible for them. What is this world coming to? Won't somebody think of the children football coaches?
