what exactly did heirs do to earn this $ other than being born into that family? this isnt a monarchy and never has been. heirs didnt work a day in their life to earn anything, so why should they be able to get everything for free?

and the constitution gives the government to right to collect taxes... or did you forget about that little clause... if you did its article 1, section 8 as well as the 16th amendment.

first off, a) you know this how? how many have inheritable/inherited wealth they had no hand in helping create or maintain? I'll wait while you get back to me with those figures....

b) who do you think you are? so you don't think someone deserves? Oh thank you commissar...deserves?? really? Okay....I don't think you deserve internet access 24 a day. hows that? what did you do to make that happen? c) your envy, no jealousy, is noted.

well internet access is a pay service so you can try to limit my usage, but it wont work.
now if an heir to a business actually works at the business, then it can be passed on to them without much tax consequence. all you need to do is hire a lawyer and go through the proper channels and paperwork.

<img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_eh.gif"/> so you'll now create a gov. agency who will vet inheritances and of they think the son has worked hard enough hes okay to forgo the tax? You're pulling my leg, right? because thats not the way it works, its taxed as an asset and due in CASH within a year.

but many heirs did not actually do anything to deserve the $ other than being born. lets look at the Hilton sisters. no jobs at the hotel, no college education, nothing but being born a hilton. do they deserve have the family business? what about actors children? or politicans children? or musicians children? they obviously had no hand in creating the family wealth, yet the benefit for the simple reason of being born into that family.

who cares? the money that is spun off the bus. has already been taxed, so has the income that created a simple cash inheritance.

i dont have any dog in the fight. especially since any estates i stand to inherit will fall well below the estate tax threshold. plus my family has basically said they are gonna spend everything "they" earned before they die. which i said more power to them. i didnt feel entitled to their money because im their child. its their money, i didnt do anything to help them earn it.

</quote>

well if its 'their money' than why are you campaigning to mess with mine? If I inherited 10 millon bucks it would mean absolutely zero zip nada to you or your situation.

Well you see, people who built their own wealth to take care of their family are really greedy bastards who don't deserve the fruits of their labor or the right to decide what to do with it. The government has the right......nay, the obligation to recover a portion of that and hand it over to the common man who isn't as "lucky".
