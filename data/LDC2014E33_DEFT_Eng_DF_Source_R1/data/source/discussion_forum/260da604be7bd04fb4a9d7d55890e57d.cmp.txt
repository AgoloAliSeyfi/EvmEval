I had a rant on the Virgin Train from Euston to Manchester yesterday evening. The conversation went into Switzerland and I purposely said that I like Switzerland because it is low on multiculturalism and cultural Marxism. Suddenly the guy in front of me jumped into debate mode “What do you mean by that?”. We were arguing furiously while everyone else just looked on in amazement or mildly participated. I asked him what the purpose is of importing millions of people from the third world and making laws that say I can't say I want to hire a British person rather than a foreign person even in a foreign country. He started arguing the usual 'If we didn't have this then there would be discrimination against women, women getting paid less, and discrimination against minorities.' I said that it has gone too far and that we now have an "immigration welfare industrial complex" where not only import people who go on benefits but import people who fill jobs that could be done by Brits who either want job or chose not to work because we give up to 26k in benefits. We are a country in decline and now £1Tn in public debt and overspending by £120Bn per year. Much of this is all fuelled by cultural Marxism. I said that he should think about his country not just cultural marxism. At that point the hard red leftist guy was speechless and I lectured him "Thatcher said that the people who pushed liberal ideologies that perpetuated Britain's decline were 'Wets'", and you seem to have been brainwashed by your communist masters through the TV, at which point he withdrew from the discussion. The lady next to him asked what I propose and I said Thatcherism with British values for British people plus manufacturing. I hope I can reply on you to help spread the good word also and get this country back on track. I have never to this day understood why these types feel compelled to make arguments that are for the decline of Britain, and I wish someone could explain it to me rationally.

I totally agree with you, however you'll probably be called racist by the many politically correct deluded left wingers on TSR.

Do you think it might have something to do with the fact that 70% of the people of these islands do not want this mass immigration yet our government allows million from very different cultures to immigrate to these islands. We call anyone who says this racist. The U.N has defined rights for indigenous peoples. We stand up for the rights of the indigenous Tibetans, Native Americans, Maori and say that Gandhi was a hero for standing up for the rights of the Indian people, but if someone wants to champion the rights of the British indigenous people they are either called racists, people want to have a riot against them and some people would send them to the gas chamber. Do you think the pressure of this suppression eventually gives way to these racist rants which are becoming so commonplace that youtube is literally filled with dozens of them.

Do you think it is just a co-incidence that some foul mouth racists stand up and deliver some foul mouth speech or do you think that this is symptomatic of the fact that the British people have had enough of immigration and this is the start of revolt.

Everything he said, and I mean everything, is wrong. All his economic arguments (British people losing jobs to immigrants etc) has been disproven by study after study.

The only vaguely correct point he makes is about the benefits trap (which has nothing to do with race, and all 3 mainstream parties admit is a real problem).

Tell me this - why should we benefit Person A over Person B just because Person A is "British" - why does that matter? Its just luck where you were born.

If you have 2 lazy people, one british and one foreign, the british person should be helped first.

If the foreigner is hardworking and the british person lazy, the foreigner should be treated better, they are bringing more to the country than the other bone idle drain.

Its not to do with race, its to do with the fact immigrants and such can receive benefits causes them to come over here in drones because their own countries are living hell holes.
