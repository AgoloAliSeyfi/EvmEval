Has it ever occurred to any of you drumbeating warmongers why the oldest civilization in the world is refusing to join "the international community of nations"?

Quite simply because it is due an overdue apology for the 1953 Iranian coup d'Ã©tat, when for the first time in the history of the Middle East and Asia as a whole came into service a government chosen by its people to serve its people. A government whose first policy included nationalisation of its oil resources. And for as long as that's not acknowledged and taught in our schools I don't think people of Iran would like to see any different course of action taken regarding their Nuclear Energy Programme.

And here is a little reminder of their ambitions for the future based on their past glorious history...

Regarding Israel, I think Iranians and Israelis couldn't have more in common in terms of history and culture and the common enemy and threat that comes from Sunni Arab Extreme Islamism. Yet both are surrounded by Sunni Arab Islamic countries. Persians and Jews for many thousand years have lived in harmony, and today the second biggest Jewish community in Middle East lives in Iran (where they have been peacefully living for the past 2.5 thousand years). Their history is intertwined at times (during Holocaust, in Nazi-occupied France -this is documented- Iranian passports where distributed to Jews and many relocated to Iran before immigrating to Israel after the world war) and during the Iran Iraq war much to everyone's surprise here perhaps, Israel was one of the few countries that sold arms to Iran to defend itself. Later even bombing Saddam's chemical and nuclear arsenal.

The shouting and drumbeating comes from outside forces who seek power and friendly dictators in the region for the sole purpose of better oil deals at the cost of internal repression. A brief look at Iran's history should reassure every politically illiterate idiot on this forum that it'll never attack Israel or anyone else for that matter as it never has done in its 5000-year long history of statehood and diplomacy.

In fact, I predict and hope for a union between these two, they have common - let's not say enemy but common competitors, that is the few families in charge of running small oil-rich countries on the southern shores of the Persian Gulf, created after the collapse of Ottoman Empire.

Well at least here's to wishful thinking... <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

I take issue with this given that Iran sponsors proxies throughout the Middle East whom constantly attack other nations.

Israel sees Iran as a threat as they have stated that they want Israel 'wiped off the map' and their uranium enrichment program doesn't exactly sound encouraging
Many Palestinians are also worried

I don't know how you got negged for this as it's a very simple concept. Actually I lie. I do see how you got negged.

"DERRRRRRRRRRRRRR ISRAEL AND AMERIKA HAS NOOKS SO IRAN SHOULD BE ALOUD NUKES DERRRRRRRRRRRR" seems a legit argument on TSR.

Look, mongoloids, even if America, Israel and their ilk have nukes, it doesn't mean it's a good idea for Iran to have them. What is so hard to understand?

the iranians have always said they are totally anti nuclear weapons and there is no proof that they are trying to make them whatsoever.

however as a nation with vast oil reserves, that hears from wiki leaks that its neighbours (saudi arabia) are begging the usa to invade it, a nation near israel....which has a thousand nukes....and surounded by american military bases,.....from their point of view it probably is a good idea to get a nuke to stave off invasion.

I have seen the republican presedential race, and for the most part most of them apart from ron paul, cant wait to testify openly how they will deal with iran, with rapturous applauses after they say "we should kill emm"

Iran as the only majority Shiite state feels obliged to spiritually give support to other Shiite people which in my opinion is comparable with the American funding for RIA attacks on the British soil. This should be regarded a natural cause of action on Iran's part... btw just out of concern, would you take issue with NATO's air support for anti-Ghaddafi rebels? Of course you wouldn't!

No but I would take issue if NATO was supplying groups with weapons that explicitly targeted civilians.

Hardly - pakistan acquired a nuke and look what has happened to them.
The only real implication of iran getting one is that there will be one sunni held nuke and now one shia held nuke - what that will result in who knows.
