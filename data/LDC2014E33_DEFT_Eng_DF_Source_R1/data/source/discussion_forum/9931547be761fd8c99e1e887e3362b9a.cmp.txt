You really believe that the impeachment was on solid ground?

Legally. Yes. Clinton broke several federal statues. People have gone to prison and lost their jobs for a lot less.

Politically. Not so much. He was still popular and the country was willing to forgive him and frankly, his being acquitted was a forgone conclusion. If he had Obama's economic numbers, he'd have been run out on a rail.

The millage that could have been gotten out of it was gotten when Ken Starr nailed down that he lied. They should have censured him and left it at that.

no. he didn't violate federal statues. everyone lies about cheating when their wife is in the room.

And Republicans across the country are wasting millions upon millions enacting laws that they KNOW are not Constitutional and will get struck down, like drug testing in order to get assistance, and voter disenfranchisement.

Wingnuts love to waste taxpayer money.

Can't blame Ken Starr. He did exactly what the IC statue is designed to do. Keep investigating until you get someone for something. That's why it was an awful law when designed, because it created guys like Starr, Lawrence Walsh, Patrick Fitzgerald, fanatics redoubling their efforts while losing sight of their goals.

And the federal perjury statues do not have a "you can lie if your wife is in the room and will brain you with an ashtray when you get home" exception. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Which is exactly the beauty of Sexual Harrassment lawsuits. You can be totally innocent of whatever you are accused of, but they can drag in every ex-girlfriend, co-worker, casual acquaintance etc, and who knows what you'll have to answer for? Which is why most companies fire the accused without hearing and settle. Then fire the accuser if she doesn't have the good sense to move on.

So, Starr was a fanatic who lost sight of his goals, but we can't blame him? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

I can't believe that the truth is so new to you, Cecille. Newt's behaviors have been documented for decades.

If you really want to base your vote on spiting someone who told you the truth, then go for it.

You right wingers are something else. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Thanks for proving my point about you being an ignorant shitstain too lazy to think and separate rumor from reality. Because EVERY intelligent person looks to a man's EX-WIFE for "the truth" about him. Sure they do. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_hand.gif"/>

Sit down and shut the fuck up before you humiliate yourself further, fucktard.

</quote>

Denial is not just a river in Egypt. That's not just from the ex-wife. It's from people who worked with him. Newt has admitted to most of what you would deny. And he came up with a wacky excuse for it. He just loved the country too much. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/rofl.gif"/>

Newt is not stable.

</quote>

Perhaps you'd like to show me where Newt admitted to anything other than having an affair on his second wife. See if you can do it using REAL news sources, rather than blogs. Amazingly enough, just because someone says it on the Internet, that doesn't make it true.

She acts like she had no idea who she was praising.

If they want to run Newt, I think that would be great. For them, and for the country.

Well, I'm sure he wouldn't get the ignorant shitstain vote. On the other hand, I don't think he wants it.

</quote>

That's cool.

I just hope every Republican feels that way.

Oh, I'm pretty sure most Republicans don't want the ignorant shitstain vote. And, after all, we're pretty used to you voting Democrat, anyway.

Joe, the links about Newt are in an earlier thread.

READ THEM.

You'll find out about the child support, and the tendency to dump wives when they get sick, and the serial adultery.

But you're right, the second wife was a lobbyist.

Now go read the rest.

Thanks.

Of course, what you WON'T find is any sort of real source that anyone who isn't a three-toothed, Art Bell-listening moron would waste time reading, let alone believing and citing to other people as though it means something.

I'm just waiting for this Deliverance reject to quote us The Weekly World News.
