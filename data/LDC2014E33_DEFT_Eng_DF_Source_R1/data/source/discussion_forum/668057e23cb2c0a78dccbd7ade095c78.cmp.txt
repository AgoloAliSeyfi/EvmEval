What exactly are you basing this on?

On another blog several years ago I said corporations wouldn't be hiring for a while for a number of reasons.

-They wanted to cut benefits and wages.
-They wanted to make the President look bad to loosen regulations or get another guy in office.

That position got slammed..but it turned out to be pretty true.

They aren't hiring. But not for the reasons you state. You imaginarium is running along the paranoid lines. I've seen many small business owners interviewed and have listened to many who are members here on this board..

A. Thousands of anti business regulations from obama

B. obama care and the associated costs.

c. Uncertainty in an anti business enviornment.

D. They're not look forward to the expiration of the Bush tax cuts.

so,, we'll wait and see who is right.

A. Which ones?
B. Cost of Healthcare was rocketing up prior to ObamaCare. Employers were asking for more of a contribution from Employees.
C. What "Anti-Business" environment? Did interest rates suddenly spike? Several rounds of QE were "anti-business"?
D. Read my OP.

and why would an employer hire new employees that he may have to lay off later and then know he's going to have to pay unemployment benefits for a lifetime? who in the hell would knowingly do that?

These are just musings..but lately there's been alot of frenzied activity from recruiters. And I just went to the office party of my old job and while talking to some of the guys there, many people who were looking for a year or more are getting snapped up.

What's going on?

Well aside from the economy getting better, the Bush tax cuts are set to expire. And there's not much evidence they did anything to help. Employers are sitting on tons and tons of liquidity and playing "shell games" to keep making money..without adding to the overall economy. Given the present anger in the public at large, I have a feeling that to quell some of this..there will be a hiring boom.

With that kind of attitude why hire anyone? that business would be a one man shop. Plus unemployment is hardly a life time, it varies depending on state but there is always an expiration date on that.

What spin?

I address your points and asked some questions. Point out the "falsehoods"...if you like. Try using some real world facts to buttress your position.

Personally, I am seeing some fairly significant movements in the Real Estate market. It appears the stockpile of the foreclosures is finally beginning to disappear. Plus, commercial investors are coming back to the table. 2012 may be a year of unexpected recovery.
