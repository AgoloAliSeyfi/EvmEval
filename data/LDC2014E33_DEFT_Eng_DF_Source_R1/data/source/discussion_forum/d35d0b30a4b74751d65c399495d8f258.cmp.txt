[If the Daily Kos doesn't know that Barak Hussein isn't a Senator, then I wouldn't expect them to know very much about very much.

Including Candoleezza Rice.

Geez, at least TRY to keep up.

At the time Condoleeza Rice was fielding for Bush Barack Obama was a Senator and that is the time frame the Kos is talking about.

But if for some reason you just can't get past your lack of confidence in The Daily Kos why not just do some Google research using such keywords as, Condi lied, or variations on that theme. I promise you'll come away with a much clearer understanding of this self-serving, mendacious little bitch than you presently have.

No.

You didn't follow my link.

Daily Kos :: About Daily Kos

<a href="http://www.dailykos.com/special/about2#dk">http://www.dailykos.com/special/about2#dk</a>

It goes to the Daily Kos's description of itself, not to the article. (thus the link is called ABOUT DAILY KOS)

They still refer to Senator Barack Obama as a contributing blogger to their blog.

I keep hearing about the liberal media and yet, its that same liberal media that never asks the difficult questions of Republicans.

Only when Democrats bring up the anti gay stance or anti Muslim or Hispanic stance of Republicans does it make it on the news. 2.4 million jobs moved to China during the Bush Administration and where is the investigative reporting? Republicans get such a free pass.

So here is Condoleezza on Morning Joe. She was asked why the US left Afghanistan and went into Iraq? She said, We always wanted a small footprint in Afghanistan. There were never going to be more troops. Oh, yea, that makes sense.

</quote>

Not to you, or to me, but the strategic and tactical goals are not something I am privy to. Do you know what they were?

<quote orig_author="rdean">
When asked why we got Saddam and not Bin Laden, she actually said that us to get Bin Laden, we would have needed donkeys. Im not making this up.

</quote>

You expect the troops to carry all that equipment themselves?

<quote orig_author="rdean">
She said Iraq is the first democracy in the Middle East, even though the first democracy was actually Iran. And shes a college professor, although a Republican college professor, so she can be forgiven.

</quote>

Iran?

Never mind. You believe that democracy works from the top down, which is why you always vote the way the DNC tells you to vote. It is a lot easier than thinking for yourself, isn't it?

<quote orig_author="rdean">
She said that Iraqs democracy will blunt Iran. Except Iraq has written Sharia law into their constitution. Islam is the national religion and all legislation is to be based on Islam. This is why women are in Burkas. Why women cant go outside without a male escort. Is it any wonder that their women are addicted to Valium? After going from being doctors and engineers and dressing like western women to burkas and being slaves? Iraq wont blunt Iran. The US and Republican policies have turned Iraq INTO Iran.

</quote>

Well, since Iran is a democracy, and Iraq uses Sharia law, they should blunt each other.

Gee, I can actually follow your logic.

<quote orig_author="rdean">
And on racism, when asked about Katrina, and remember, when two whites were shown with bottled water and bread, they were called survivors, but when two blacks had bottled water and bread, they were looters, she said, We have to stop talking about race to heal. Sounds like a typical Republican plan. Shut the victims up and everything will go away.

</quote>

Is the government supposed to interfere with free speech? Or are you trying to claim the Rice herself said these things?

<quote orig_author="rdean">
And no one challenged her on anything. It was a disgrace.

</quote>

What exactly were they supposed to challenge her on? What did she lie about?

You're a fucking racist. Is this a mainstream attitude within the left?

</quote>

As I told you elsewhere, if I were a racist I would not have voted for Obama. But the word racist is so over-used and so frequently misused that it's come to mean whatever the respective user wants it to mean.

So, once again, my understanding of the word racist is it refers to one who dislikes all members of a specific race because they belong to that race -- which excludes me from the category. By the way, I hasten to add that if I were a racist I would not hesitate to admit it because I'd have no reason not to.

Now, what is your definition of the word, racist? What exactly is it you're accusing me of.

</quote>

I do not know what her definition of racist is, but if you want mine I suggest you look in a mirror.
