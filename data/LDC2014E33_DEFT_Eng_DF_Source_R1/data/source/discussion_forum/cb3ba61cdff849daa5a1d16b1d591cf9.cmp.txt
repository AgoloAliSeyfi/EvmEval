After reading through the posts in this thread, isn't the main issue one where BRITISH nationals are being denied the right to come here. And these includes groups from say Bermuda or something as well as those from Hong Kong who were born there when it was still a British Overseas Territory. I mean not even everyone in HK is a British national - only a proportion of the population are. And we actually felt it was alright for these fellow countrymen to be handed over to the regime in China?!? (correct me if I have got my facts wrong).

I think it's a real shame on the part of our Government for treating them like this.

I think its perfectly legitimate for these groups of people to be denied EU freedom of movement rights because strictly speaking they're not Europeans (despite being British). But its a different matter all together to say that these people are not afforded the right to even live in the UK - the country of their nationality. I think this is what the original starter of the thread (JoshW) is driving at.

I mean look at the French. I once met this girl when I was traveling abroad who told me she was 'French'. She spoke fluent French and all that, but it turned out that she wasn't from France! She was born and grew up in a French overseas territory near Mauritius. But yet she has a proper French passport (with EU rights included!) just like you and me.

With other Commonwealth places like Australia / NZ / Singapore etc fair enough - don't let them in - because as someone mentioned above, they have also imposed restrictions on our entry. But in the case of actual British nationals being treated in this way, I think it's a bit too much.

With laudable practices in other EU countries, it really makes me wonder....whether it is really the EU guys in Brussels who are opposed to non-whites coming in or whether its more like Westminster disliking the idea of allowing British nationals back into the UK.

Sounds like we are falling foul of the EU standard practice in the way we treat our nationals.

It is really appalling that the Government is denying *British* nationals the right to live, study and work in *Britain* without subject to immigration control, but at the same time granting all these rights to *foreign* nationals from the EU.

I recently found a document written by a human right organisation. The document discusses about the development of the British Nationality Law in the 20th century and the early 21st century. It also highlights some important issues.
