The conditions of surrender were not Japan's.

They were ours.

The atomic bombs sure as hell DID make Japan acquiesce to them.

Your bogus and unsupported claim that this "line" has been "proven [sic] wrong on several levels" is bullshit. Of course, bullshit is your sole stock in trade, so it's no surprise you'd say such dishonest shit. At. All.

You're a fucking dumbass no matter what issue you try to debate and you prove it once again. The Official US policy before the bombs was an "Unconditional Surrender." After the bombs it was the US that gave in to Japan's terms you ignorant fuck.

"On August 10, 1945, Japan offered to surrender to the Allies, the only condition being that the emperor be allowed to remain the nominal head of state."

"On August 12, the United States announced that it would accept the Japanese surrender, making clear in its statement that the emperor could remain in a purely ceremonial capacity only."

Embarrass yourself some more Snitch Bitch.

Your puerile and always ineffective effort at ad hominem has never bolstered even one of your ridiculous arguments and in this case it constitutes just another massive fail by you in your long line of massive fails.

We called for unconditional surrender and we got it the day AFTER we dropped the SECOND of the two atomic bombs.

That we chose to be even moderately magnanimous doesn't change the equation at all. Not even a tiny little bit.

The Japanese were permitted to keep their titular head, the Emperor. We granted them that much. But the unconditional surrender we had demanded came only when they saw clearly that we could completely destroy them. (Ironically, the second atomic bomb was the last in our then very tiny "stockpile." But thankfully, the enemy was in no position to realize this.)

I have not embarrassed me, you stupid PussyPuddle. I embarrassed you, even if you remain too stupid and dishonest to recognize it or admit it.

Of course, as always, you embarrassed yourself, too. You always do.

Snitch Bitch. I just posted the fact Japan offered a conditional surrender and we accepted their conditional surrender which means it was not an unconditional surrender. Keep embarrassing yourself Snitch Bitch.

You keep ignoring the fact Leahy clearly stated the bombs were not necessary for Japan to surrender. Why? Because you aren't here to discuss anything. You're a parasite.

</quote>

You keep editing the full quote:

Admiral William Leahy told President Truman: "This is the biggest fool thing we have ever done. The bomb will never go off, and I speak as an expert in explosives."

Quentin posted Leahy's position in #156 and you keep ignoring it. Parasite.

It was understood at the time that unless the Japanese surrendered, we would lose as many as a half a million to a million of our fighting men to finally defeat the Japanese Empire. And the Japanese were not going to surrender. The citizenry was being trained in how to fight to the last man, woman and child.

It took the atomic bomb to prove to them that it was futile. And even the first one didn't turn the trick.

Compared to how many of OUR soldiers' lives were at stake -- not even counting the many fold MORE Japanese lives that would be lost -- the math alone underscores a tragic (but real) morality in going atomic.

A horrible, horrifying and wrenching decision by President Truman? Absolutely.

But immoral?

Based on the quantification of human life, the decision was far more moral than the alternative.

This is the same exact line that's been proven wrong on several levels.

The bombs did not make Japan change its conditions for surrender. At. All.

Your argument is a fail, at all levels, CurveLight.

So, am I to take it that we've abandoned the ethics discussion on this thread for rehashing history?

Just FYI, this particular bit of history was already re-hashed on another USMB thread about 9 months ago. Maybe y'all wanna search for it and pick that argument up where it died off.
