The famous sixteen words were taken out of the SOTU address Bush gave because the intell to back it up was not there. The Bush administration put them back in.

The famous 16 words were correct. The British did have evidence the Iraqis were trying to buy uranium. MI-6 stood by that statement. So it was an accurate statement. they didn't get it, but they asked for it.

Look, guy, George Tenat went into Bush's office and said "It's a slam dunk, Mr. President!"

Joe Wilson wrote in the LA Times that no only did Saddam have WMD's, but we needed to give him a graceful way out because he'd use them.

This is a lot of people playing CYA when something goes wrong. If you had a real job, you see it happens every day in the business world, who ends up holding the bag of dog poop.

Myself. Saddam was a scumbag and I'm glad he's dead. Aren't you?

Jackie Gingrich, Newt and his first wife's daughter, however have refuted the story of him "divorcing his wife when she was battling cancer". Jackie said--I'm thinking in a Larry King interview but can't remember for sure--that it was her mother who requested the divorce and the tumor was benign, not cancer. He did start dating Marriane before the divorce was final and was cheating on Marianne when he confessed that infidelity.

However those who condemn Newt's personal life, which was pretty scuzzy, don't seem to have a problem with President Clinton's affair with Gennifer Flowers, various other 'bimbo eruptions, and getting blow jobs in the Oval Office and don't seem to think that impaired his ability to preside.

So either there is a huge double standard at play here or Newt's infidelities don't matter either.

How about it?

Republicans are the preacher party. So Republicans have to live up to that.

Republicans are the bulk of the ones who claimed that Clinton's infidelities mattered. I know a few Democrats spoke out against him but they were few and far between. I personally think that if Hyde hadn't rushed the matter through the House there might have been more time for some of the more serious allegations to be substantiated and for other people who had been keeping silent to speak up. There might even have been official rape charges to contend with, not just rumors. But Hyde did rush it. And basically the Republicans looked mean for it, so they justly have to carry extra baggage around with them when they transgress traditional mores.

Eneeeway... some people do object to both Gingrich and Clinton.

But it's not necessarily an incorrect double standard to condemn one and not the other. Republicans are the ones who said it mattered. If you live by the sword, you die by the sword.

Democrats can have their Clintons and their Weiners and move on from it more quickly than we can. It's just plain not the indictment of their party which Republican cheaters are of ours.

I am one who said the infidelities did not affect Clinton's ability to president any more than it affected FDR or JFK that we KNOW fooled around and some others for whom there are suspicions. And while I do not condone anybody cheating on his/her spouse, and do think it calls their character into question, I am nevertheless fully qualified to comment on the reverse hypocrisy when Democrats didn't condemn their own but hold Republicans to a higher standard. Most especially when they have repeatedly accused us of condemning Clinton for the 'blow jobs' instead of the actual offenses.

The fact that Gingrich said it matters makes his case different from Clinton's.

A free country must have honest leaders if it is to remain free. We are in deep trouble as a society... People are looking for a guidepost as to how they should live, how their institutions should behave, and who they should follow.

That was in connection with the page scandals of 1983.

He stitched up his own baggage. He has to carry it. It's good of you to try to be fairminded, but Gingrich made his Samsonite. Deliberately and methodically. Now he has to carry it.
