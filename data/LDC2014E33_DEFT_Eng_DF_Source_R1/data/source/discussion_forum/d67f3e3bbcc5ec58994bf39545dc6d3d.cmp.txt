I was reading in the paper today about all the laws under consideration that would make it harder for Americans to vote when I suddenly flashed on all the purple fingered Iraqi voters that were so celebrated in our press only a few short years ago.

I think I must be missing something because I'm really confused by this.

Why would any state do anything that would make it harder for it's citizens to vote?

Please can someone explain this to me?

@boomerang,

I've not heard this and it seems crazy to me - do you have the link to the article?

@Linkat,

This is not the one I read (which was in my paper) but it seems to have the same general information: <a href="http://business-journal.com/study-quantifies-impact-of-new-voting-laws-p20096-1.htm">http://business-journal.com/study-quantifies-impact-of-new-voting-laws-p20096-1.htm</a>

@boomerang,

That's pretty easy. Conseratives figure (and probably with justification) that their voter base will get out and vote without regard for any minor hurdles which might be thrown in their way. They rely on older citizens and more affluent citizens. Anything which makes voting more difficult they figure will reduce the number of voters going to the polls to vote for Democrats.

@Setanta,

That's how I read it too but I figured I had to be missing something because this just makes me goddamn sick.

I have never been an "I hate America" or a "Rah! Go America!" person but seriously.... making it so that people have a hard time voting? That is seriously messed up.

@boomerang,

I don't have a problem with the first two - provided that they make available photo IDs at no cost to people with limited income and allow clear instructions and make it easy to obtain (in other words - there are many locations to obtain and enough hours that are varied enough to get these ids).

I support having IDs to limit voter fraud, but you cannot make it difficult and it should be economically feasible for all to get an ID. I mean if you make the extra effort to go out and vote - it shouldn't be much more a burden to get an ID.

@Linkat,

A quick look around for research on voter fraud leads me to believe that it isn't really a problem and that in the few cases where it is a problem, requiring photo IDs wouldn't have helped: <a href="http://www.truthaboutfraud.org/pdf/TruthAboutVoterFraud.pdf">http://www.truthaboutfraud.org/pdf/TruthAboutVoterFraud.pdf</a>

@boomerang,

Kansas reports more sightings of UFOs than voter-fraud charges. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"/>

We don't have such problems here since we don't have to register (but are registered automatically).
And since everyone here has to own an ID-card, that's no problem neither.

What makes me wonder is how differently states look at this: in Texas, a voter doesn't even have to show his driver's license or passport — he can qualify just by producing his license to carry a concealed handgun. However, any any form of student identification is not eligible.
