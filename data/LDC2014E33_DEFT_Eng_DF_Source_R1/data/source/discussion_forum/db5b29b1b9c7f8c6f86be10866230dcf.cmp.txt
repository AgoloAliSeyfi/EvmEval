There's no TRUTH is this pile of shit.

She never did. Not once. That did not stop Rush from saying things like this: Rush said she has boyfriends " Lined up around the block."

He said she said " she was having so much sex she can't afford it."

He asked: "...what does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a prostitute. She wants to be paid to have sex. She's having so much sex she can't afford the contraception.

And: "Ms. Fluke, have you ever heard of not having sex? Have you ever heard of not having sex so often?"

After saying that the Washington, D.C., Department of Health "will send you free condoms and lube," Limbaugh said: "So, Ms. Fluke and the rest of you feminazis, here's the deal. If we are going to pay for your contraceptives, and thus pay for you to have sex, we want something for it, and I'll tell you what it is. We want you to post the videos online so we can all watch."

Rush asked of Ms. Fluke: "Who bought your condoms in junior high? Who bought your condoms in the sixth grade? Or your contraception. Who bought your contraceptive pills in high school?"

Then: Fluke is "having so much sex, it's amazing she can still walk." He also said Georgetown should establish a "Wilt Chamberlin scholarship... exclusively for women."

Then, again, Limbaugh defended his previous comments and complained "not one person says that, ' Well, did you ever think about maybe backing off the amount of sex that you have?'

Later, Limbaugh said that requiring insurance companies to cover contraception is "no different than if somebody knocked on my door that I don't know and said, 'You know what? I'm out of money. I can't afford birth-control pills, and I'm supposed to have sex with three guys tonight.' "
Fluke never even once talked about her own sexual activity. In, no way, shape or form. In fact, in her testimony, she even said:

And so, Im here today to share their voices, and I want to thank you for allowing them  not me  to be heard."

All that came from his mouth was a 3 day long tirade of misogynistic putrid slurs and below-the-belt slander aimed at a woman who testified about a public policy matter.

There wasn't an ounce of truth in his words.

By her behavior Fluke proved the absolute truth of what he said. She wants birth control coverage to the tune of $1,000 a year. As has been ABUNDANTLY made clear, to use that much BC, she has to be having sex so often that it's a wonder how she is getting through school. But that's a matter between the school and the professors.

Are you honestly too stupid to understand that the amount of birth control pills a woman uses has no relationship whatsoever to the frequency of intercourse she has.

ARE YOU HONESTLY THAT STUPID, or are you simply padding your reputation as a USMB troll?

</quote>

Can't you just admit that the cost of birth control pills doesn't come close to the money she claims she requires to support her sex addiction? Are you deliberately stupid, or just trying to obfuscate just this one time. If all she needs are birth control pills, that doesn't come CLOSE to the $1,000 she claims she needs? No one wants to deny her birth control and disease control for this woman is a public health matter (which is why so many clinics give out free condoms) she just has to either pay for it, or extend herself far enough to get it free like the street whores do.

So, your point is that, rather than presenting herself as a slut, she is presenting herself as the 'Voice of the Sluts"?

Is that the correction you would like?

</quote>

No, she's documenting the long list of lies that Limbaugh manufactured for the purpose of defaming the character of this woman.

</quote>

aren't you the one who called Michelle Malkin a cxxt?
you all are two faced hypocrites...admit it

</quote>

If I did that would not be an apt analogy because Michelle Malkin chose to make a lucrative career out of fitting that description.

You didn't answer my question. I'll repeat it.
