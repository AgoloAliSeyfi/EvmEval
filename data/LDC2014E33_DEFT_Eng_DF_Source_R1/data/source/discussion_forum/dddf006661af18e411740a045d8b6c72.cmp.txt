Stupid cigarettes

Stupid cigarette smokers.

Stupid higher health insurance rates for me because I have to foot part of the premiums for the stupid smokers and their stupid health problems due to their stupid "choice"

Stupid stink that hangs around them, their cloths, hair and vulture breath.

Every morning when I come into the office, there's anywhere from 1 to half a dozen people standing their 15 feet or whatever it is from the front door, stinking up the immediate area.

For months, regardless of how many were there, I'd say "Good Morning" to the individual or group. (different subject, but I have a real thing about greeting people when I first see them in the morning, before launching into the business of the day. Even if it's a friendly "hey! How are you?")

The response would either be..

Or.

Then a slow awareness would come to some eyes, and there would be a muttered."yeah.hi" from a couple of people, while the others remained in a fog.

One day, I thought I'd give them the opportunity to say something first.that was back atoh xmas time. Since then, it's just been the apathetic stares of people whose brains are so clogged up they don't even know enough to say good morning.

I got to work the other day and six people were outside the back door smoking... I punched in and was throwing down the last of my bagel when the manager came in and said "I know you're not eating that bagel on the clock" I asked if all the people smoking had already clocked in, which they had, and went back to my bagel.

BVT, 3-4 packs for 30 yrs?!
My god man, you are lucky to be alive and well right now!
And I'm so glad you are and you quit. That is very inspirational.

I'm still smoke free. Excepting I tried a herbal cigarette w/ clove and that was gross. So forget it.
Ehh...tycoon...I think you made a good point about the smell of the smoke. Yes, it is still appealing to me, and that worries me a bit. A part of me still wants to be a smoker, it's true. That was very observant.
I wonder what makes it so it becomes offensive. ? ? Possibly a switch of mind and mentality?

chai..hehee. That picture is perfect! I guess as a smoker we really can come across that way....i've seen that before and tried to repress that.

Yesterday was such a weird day for me. I work in support/advocacy, so I'm often being sent or roaming around different parts of the city to see people. Most times it's poorer areas, etc.

well, yesterday I had most of the day on my own time, just had a few things to do, and decided to go see a few folks i used to work with, check out how they were doing as I'd heard they were doing alright and i'm friends with one of guys who works with their family. So, yeah, I picked up some Tim H. coffee and I'm waiting to get a call to let me in.....

and I see this girl, maybe 18 or 20 or so, with a baby and a toddler and a cigarette hanging out of her mouth. She was wearing a cropped top that showed her stretched-out baby belly and jeans that looked like they belonged to a 12 yr old.
It was so sad. I won't go into it too much, but I wanted to cry for her.

I helt her toddler for a few minutes while she lit her smoke, and chatted for a bit.

Today I've been seeing things really differently, and I think a lot of it had to do with her.

So many people in my field and who i work with smoke, the people we work with smoke at a very very high rate, so it's usual to offer them a smoke and sort of form a bond and get them yapping that way.

This whole long story = I finally am starting to associate Smoking W/Sickness and pain.

Smokers are becoming pariahs, there is little doubt about that trend. For my part I wish peer pressure, rather than city-wide smoking bans in public and private businesses, would continue to push smokers to give up the habit. (Chai Tea's admonishments are ten times more effective than city council proclamations, IMO.)

Flushd, I'm glad to hear you had a positive day. I really have no further advice to help you, though I wish I did. I'm not sure when the smell of smoke became disagreeable to me, but I believe ex-smokers can detect the smell better than non-smokers. I quit before my wife did and recall smelling the residual smell of smoke on her several feet away.

I noticied something flushd, you said "we" smokers can come across that way.

Switch the mind set to "I'm a non-smoker"

Why do you become aware of the odor? Because you can finally smell it and you realize it STINKS!!!!

I can see the prettiest girl or woman, but if she gets near me and I smell smoke, I just can't think of her as attractive anymore.

IMO, she doesn't look as intelligent anymore either.

I mentioned a yoga book earlier. It was 1965 or so. No way I can recall the title.
