The Eviction Process – an Overview
Step 1. The Eviction Notice

The eviction process, with few exceptions, begins with a notice. The most common include: for non-payment of rent, a three-day-notice-to-pay-or-vacate; for failure to comply with a term of the lease, a ten-day-notice-to-comply-or-vacate; for waste or nuisance a three-day-quit-notice; or a notice to terminate a tenancy. Eviction notice forms may be downloaded for free.

While the landlord may serve more than one type of notice, this will cause problems if the notices are inconsistent. For example, a landlord would be unwise to serve a nuisance notice in combination with other notices. Consult an attorney if unsure which notices to serve.

Step 2. Initiating the Eviction Litigation – The Summons and Complaint

If the tenant fails to comply with the notice, the next step in the eviction is to initiate litigation. This is done by serving the tenant with a summons and complaint. The tenant must answer the summons by the deadline specified, generally 7-10 days from the date of service. Because the landlord is a party to the action, the landlord may not serve the summons and complaint.

Step 3. Default or a Show Cause Hearing

A. Default

If there is no response to the summons and complaint relief may be obtained from the court by default without notice to the tenant. In Washington a defendant, including a tenant, does not have to do a lot to appear. Even a phone call could be treated as an appearance.

OR

B. The Show Cause Hearing

If the tenant makes an appearance, even an informal one, a hearing is required. The tenant must be given notice of the hearing. The tenant must show cause at this hearing as to why you are not entitled to possession and a judgment for rent immediately, i.e. without the need for a trial. (Unless service was by alternative means, in which case you are only entitled to possession but not a judgment.)

The landlord or property manager must attend the hearing.

The show cause order may be served at the time the summons and complaint are served or any time afterwards. If the tenant responds to am unfiled summons, a show cause hearing must be set to continue the eviction process. Because of this tenant right to “automatically” delay the eviction process consider serving the show cause order with the summons and complaint.

Step 4. The Sheriff Steps In

After the writ of restitution is obtained, whether by default or at the show cause hearing, the sheriff will serve it. The tenant will have three business days to vacate, not including the day of service.

If the tenant does not vacate the premises in this time-frame you must contact the sheriff’s civil department and arrange a physical eviction.

That's a possibility. I think 7-11 does money orders as well. Would it make any difference which one I went with? Also, can I convert a money order back into cash if they won't accept the money order?

Won't accept the MO? You really need to talk to a lawyer.

The blankets don't belong to me. Also, what recourse do I have if they do illegal things? =(

1) You can buy blankets incredibly cheap

2) Seriously? You've never heard of the police?

I suggest money orders as at least an alternative because the PO keeps records. I can't say for 7-11, but maybe if you photocopy the MO after filling it out, and note the serial number?

Well, maybe the money order in addition to making them sign a thing saying I paid December rent?

Maybe not your blankets, but some states/most states? have "warranties of habitability." In other words, it's her obligation to provide a safe, clean, comfortable environment. Varies among states. You really need to talk to a lawyer.

I see.

Your recourse is to ask the police for assistance whenever anyone does anything illegally.

The issue is that I grew up in a very abusive household, so I'm in the dark as to my legal rights...

OMG that looks way worse than the first link you shared. I think the thing they're trying to do is the three-day-pay-or-vacate thing D:
So:

* is December 4th the last day of the 3 day thing, or the day I can be evicted, technically?

* if I pay, I'm good for December, right?

She is *crazy*. Pill addict for over 30 years = crazy. Seriously. Lying, manipulative person. Even without the possible issue of being homeless because of her, I have to get out anyways, it's not a positive environment.

Right now I have about $100, less than 3 days of food, and I need to buy a winter coat. Did I mention I have no job, and the money order thing is messed up? :)
