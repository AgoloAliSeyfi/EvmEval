Right now, I would give Bachmann about the same odds as I gave a certain young Senator from Illinois back in Jul, 2007.

@slkshock7,

That just means that you are used to making wrong predictions. Obama had the benefit of being an opponent of a popular and capable female candidate. The GOP field is now full of clowns. SO much so that I hear they all ride together in the same car when going to their various events.

@farmerman,

Well, that's exactly what I said of the Dem slate back in 2007 as well. You and I must think alike.
