Makes you wonder how many lives could be saved if our society had a different view of drugs and drug users.

I wish we viewed it as a disease and as an opportunity to help people, rather than an opportunity to throw someone in jail.

And dont' read into that wrong, I'm not advocating gov't set up some huge program.

Celebrities i agree, we shouldn't worship them, I've never understood that.

But i don't get why we should hate someone, who after using a drug one time, has their mind altered so much that their brain demands they use again no matter the ramifications.

This coming from me, someone who's never once used any illegal drug. Not even weed.

Is that what you believe? That using a drug once alters one's mind enough that their brain demands it? Sorry, I ain't buying it. We control our minds. Our minds do not control us. This coming from someone who has smoked weed and from someone who has turned her Life around for the better, knowing that everything I need comes from within. But, I needed the assistance of outside sources to learn the powerful source I have within.

Gov Christie has ordered that all state flags in NJ be lowered to half mast this Saturday to honor Whitney Houston

Is it appropriate?

Ask a doctor how many uses it takes to get hooked on cocaine or meth. One time, and a normally good person could get turned right into a fuck up.

I think we should use it as an opportunity to get the good person back, rather than throw that person in prison.

I'm sure after getting caught using enough times you'll go to jail.

But even still, removing the black market for selling drugs would keep a lot of non-violent ppl out of prisons.

ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!!

That would be a disgrace...

I have a hard time believing a guy like Christie would do such a thing - yet he did.

Fucking RINO...

Houston was no goddamn patriot and is NOT deserving of such a "communication" of honor.
