Not a Government issue. The Government should not force anyone to pay for someone else's personal sexual behavior. Have all the Contraception &amp; Abortions you want, but pay for it yourself. The Government shouldn't be involved with these issues.

since the government is not providing services, your argument is invalid. and im glad to see you skipped over the rest of my argument on how insurance works in general. so i assume you are ok with paying your premiums to your health insurance company knowing that they provide abortions?

Some things i just can't control. I don't like Abortion but if Health Insurance covers it, than so be it. But the Government shouldn't be involved with issues like this. Contraception and Abortion are private personal matters.

again since they are not providing it, i dont see how it is your concern. would you as upset if they mandated that mammograms be provided at no extra charge? because thats part of the ACA as well.

man you need to go back and get an education of at least the high school level.

so lets use your car insurance analogy.

so you have car insurance (mandated by the government none the less). and you get in an accident and cause damage. we'll even take your liability case as an example. the damage you cause is $75,000. now youve only had insurance for 1 years at a rate of $50 per month. so you in essence have paid $600 into the insurance pool. now where does the other $74,400 come from? Other peoples premiums!!!!! holy shit, so other people are actually paying for your mistakes. you are correct in one thing, and that is insurance helps spread the risk. now if you have full coverage insurance and you get hurt, then your insurance company will pay out to yourself. same example, if you have had insurance for 1 year and have been paying $50 a month ($600 a year) and get in an accident that is your fault and your medical bills are $200,000. where does that other $199,400 come from? ohhh thats right other people premiums!!!!! amazing, you dont understand how this works.

How does that disprove my assertion that buying insurance is paying another person to assume the risk?

<quote orig_author="Syphon">
but you are wrong in the way it works behind the scenes. i never said it was a fee based services. i said you pay a fee for "access" to medical services. that fee is called a premium. you fail to understand that somewhere somehow the actual cost for your services is paid for by the pool of money the company bring in through premiums. if an insurance company is paying out more in services than they are getting in premiums they current do 2 things. they drop those who cost too much to insure, or they raise rates to cover those services. regardless, the money that actually pays doctors is from the pool of premiums that everyone pays. hence you pay other peoples services every day of the week. whether you want to admit it or not.
but the again the right isnt big on facts.

</quote>

Again, a premium is not so you have access to service, your premium is paid to another person so they assume the risk. How the person, or company, deals with that risk is irrelevant, you are not paying them so you can access services. Hence, no one pays anyone for anyone else's services ever. This is the last time I am going to explain this, so feel free to blather your ignorance in assurance that I will not again explain why the sky is blue. Feel free to insist it is orange and declare victory if you like, it won't bother me.

No, they dont, because they know its illegal to use taxpayers funds to subsidize abortion. So liberals dont want to have it both ways, theyre being perfectly honest and consistent.

If conservatives really want Big Government out of the bedroom and an age of personal responsibility to dawn, then they need to cease their efforts to violate a womans right to privacy with regard to abortion and access to contraceptives.

The hypocrisy and ignorance belongs to conservatives alone.

<a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2010/04/the-abortion-issue/">FactCheck.org : The Abortion Issue</a>

Unless of course one is dealing with conservatives who oppose abortion for women in cases of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother; in addition to being ignorant hypocrites, such conservatives are also criminals.

These are private personal matters. They are not Government matters. The Government should not be involved with these issues at all. Have all the Contraceptives &amp; Abortions you want, just don't demand fellow Citizens pay for it. Your personal sexual behavior is your business &amp; responsibility. Fellow Citizens/Taxpayers are not responsible for subsidizing your personal sexual behavior. The Government needs to get out of the bedroom once and for all.

read my several posts on how health insurance actually works and realize that you already pay for other peoples services. and you raising issues with your health care provider already? making sure that none of your premiums dollars are going towards services you disagree with?
