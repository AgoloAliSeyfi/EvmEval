Thats because the average American like the average Canadian knows jack
squat about the political side of war and they have to listen to the extremely vocal/synical nutjobs like broken. They want everything now and can't fathom
just how long it took the Muslim world to get itself in the current mess it finds itself in.

As long as there are people like Broken who feel guilty for everything the U.S. is, does and stands for, communists, islamifacists and anarchists hold onto the hope that one day the capitalist dogs will give up.

One of the things I've continuously said is that the Middle east needs a few more Mustafa Kemals to kick the hardline islamifacists in the ass. Sadly I think Broken misses Saddams rule.

I don't mean to imply that you are completely disconnected from reality, but did you happen to notice that this thread has nothing to do with the war?

1. Record lows for President Bush, not record lows for any president.
2. Why do you show only President Bush poll numbers? That doesn't support your argument - your argument was that average Americans aren't buying it (with it referring to my statement that the main responsibility for the poor response is the federal government). Sorry, the poll numbers just don't support your position. You shouldn't have left this out:

Here are the percentages (in descending order) who say each of the following are responsible for either "a lot" or "a good amount" of the blame for Katrina-related problems:

State governments: 74%
Local governments: 67%
U.S. government: 63%
President Bush: 55%
Local residents: 48%

According to that poll, the Average American believes that the state government was most responsible, followed by the local government, and of all levels of government, the federal government was third. The numbers are great for the federal government or President Bush on this issue, but your attempted portrayal/argument is exposed as wrong by these numbers.

Amazing. Out of the dozen or so polls on Bush's Katrina performance, you just happen to pick the only one that casts him in a good light. Not biased, are we? Check out the other eleven polls <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/disasters.htm">HERE (two pages)</a>. Quite grim.

Oh, and while you are at it, check the latest Bush job performance poll from the flaming leftist media:

Fox News
(Approve/Disapprove)
41 51

While you are obsessing on the Louisiana Governor and New Orleans mayor, reflect on this: the vast majority of us don't vote for either of them. We do, however, all vote for the federal government. We can do something about that.

The reality is the federal government is held responsible for disaster response. Bush 41 discovered that, to his cost, in 1992. Clinton took that lesson to heart and appointed a competent FEMA manager. Bush 43's FEMA did respond well to the Florida hurricanes last year: food, water, and assistance were waiting before the hurricane even hit. But that was an election year and Florida was critical to his re-election.

Contrast that to the Katrina response. Even <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/003458.htm"> Michelle Malkin</a> was calling for the FEMA director to be fired. I hope, for your sake, that you do not consider Malkin a liberal.

Description of Appeal to Popularity

The Appeal to Popularity has the following form:

1. Most people approve of X (have favorable emotions towards X).
2. Therefore X is true.

The basic idea is that a claim is accepted as being true simply because most people are favorably inclined towards the claim. More formally, the fact that most people have favorable emotions associated with the claim is substituted in place of actual evidence for the claim. A person falls prey to this fallacy if he accepts a claim as being true simply because most other people approve of the claim.

It is clearly fallacious to accept the approval of the majority as evidence for a claim. For example, suppose that a skilled speaker managed to get most people to absolutely love the claim that 1+1=3. It would still not be rational to accept this claim simply because most people approved of it. After all, mere approval is no substitute for a mathematical proof. At one time people approved of claims such as "the world is flat", "humans cannot survive at speeds greater than 25 miles per hour", "the sun revolves around the earth" but all these claims turned out to be false.

This sort of "reasoning" is quite common and can be quite an effective persusasive device. Since most humans tend to conform with the views of the majority, convincing a person that the majority approves of a claim is often an effective way to get him to accept it. Advertisers often use this tactic when they attempt to sell products by claiming that everyone uses and loves their products. In such cases they hope that people will accept the (purported) approval of others as a good reason to buy the product.
