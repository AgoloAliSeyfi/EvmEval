He does not have the righ to slander a private citizen.

Well, actually, he does. She stopped being a "private citizen" the minute she got up in front of Congress and testified and took a political stand. Then she became a "political activist", which is pretty much stepping up into the dunk-tank of public opinion.

Not saying this is "right" or even "good". In fact, I suspect a lot of people who would make good leaders stray away from politics because of EXACTLY this sort of thing.

But it's part and parcel of our system. Even back to the oldie days when they talked about Thomas Jefferson's mistress or slandered Andrew Jackson's wife.

(Of course, Andrew liked to challenge people to duels. Maybe we need to bring that back!)

Actually, no she didn't.

Public figure is a legal term applied in the context of defamation actions (libel and slander) as well as invasion of privacy. A public figure (such as a politician, celebrity, or business leader) cannot base a lawsuit on incorrect harmful statements unless there is proof that the writer or publisher acted with actual malice (knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth[1] ). The burden of proof in defamation actions is higher in the case of a public figure.

[edit] U.S. lawThe controlling precedent in the United States was set in 1964 by the United States Supreme Court in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan. It is considered a key decision in supporting the First Amendment and freedom of the press.

A fairly high threshold of public activity is necessary to elevate people to public figure status. Typically, they must either be:

a public figure, either a public official or any other person pervasively involved in public affairs, or
a limited purpose public figure, meaning those who have "thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved." A "particularized determination" is required to decide whether a person is a limited purpose public figure, which can be variously interpreted. According to attorney Aaron Larson,[citation needed][2]

But even if she did become a public figure she did nothing to cast herself into the nomenclature Limbaugh used to lambast her. He was malicious and his comments harmful.

</quote>

Well, it's a fine line. But here's the reality.

She's a college student who apparently struggles to pay tuition and birth control.

Rush makes 50 million a year on the radio, and was able to hire lawyers who beat a drug beef where they caught him pretty much red-handed.

Legal Firepower is what wins court cases...

Looks like the Left is just pissy because they can't beat this dead horse anymore. The man apologized. And that's more than hateful Left nutters ever do. It's over. Time to move on.

</quote>

Almost time for you four year locust Paulbots to move back into your burrows, isn't it?

</quote>

Whatever Obama-Bot. Hateful Left nutters like you never apologize for their absurd &amp; hurtful comments. You Douchers even went after Palin's children for God's sake. Limbaugh apologized. It's over. I know it upsets you that you can't milk it anymore, but it is over. So time for a reboot there Obama-Bot. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

Did you let Monica Lewinsky go? He's the spokesperson of the GOP. We are in an election year. Imagine the thousands of undecided or new voters that Rush has pushed over to our side???

</quote>

Sure. Thousands of new voters just drooling <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_drool.gif"/> to vote for Obie.
Less then 5 per cent of the electorate will remember this come next November. (And I'm being generous!).
You are a F'ing idiot!!!

Wanna make a bet?

Women WILL NOT forget this, nor will the dems not capitalize on this fully and remind them in ad after ad - and I don't blame them.

</quote>

Fortunately, you do not speak for most women.
Between now and next Nov., most women (not you, tho'), will have been filling up their SUV's at the pump to drop off their kids for school, continue to pay for increased food prices, and some aware ones may be even aware of continued runaway debt (hell, some may realize that Greece has begun to get their fiscal house in order, even before us!).
I welcome the Dems in an attempt to capitalize on this and hope they will spend alot of money on ad after ad............. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/clap2.gif"/>.

Has Rush Limbaugh EVER apologized before? I certainly can't remember it ever happening.

I wonder how his dittoheads who defended him are going to take this.

Women are noticing the things he is saying. Let's hope they remember this in November.

He isn't running for President, so what's your point?

Do you have ANY proof of the above statement?
