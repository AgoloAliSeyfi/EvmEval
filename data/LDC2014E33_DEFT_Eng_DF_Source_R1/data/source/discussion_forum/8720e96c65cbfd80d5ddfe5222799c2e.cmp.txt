You have a crystal ball?

Too bad you didn't have that back in 2004, you could have told your fellow righties not to vote for the debt doubler.

</quote>

and yet you voted for a new "debt doubler".

</quote>

You should have lent me your crystal ball. I don't have one. And yet even if I knew, I'd have approved. We aren't in a great depression now BECAUSE of what Obama's done with his policies.

</quote>

I think your leather thong is about 5 sizes too small and it's cutting off the circulation to your brain.

All Obamalamadingdong has done is spend like a madman.

He makes Bush look like Goldwater.

Hell, Obama makes Clintoon look like Goldwater.

Pretty much...I quit listening to him because he's such a damned negative Nancy.

In any case, he was busting pretty hard on the administration and the (R) congress for spending like crazy.

</quote>

Savage and Boortz were going pretty nuts too.

And in the end, Bush's poll numbers were circling the drain because of his spending... among other things.

Savage is definitely an equal opportunity hater.

No, I didn't get a tax cut. You're not thinking the tax rebates are the same as tax cuts like Yurt thinks are you?

Only the richest of the rich got those Bush tax cuts.

</quote>

Another myth of the Kool-Aid banging left.

I got a pretty fair reduction in my tax bill, and I'm nowhere near the "richest of the rich".

In any case, the basis of the thread is still shot to hell.

</quote>

There was a capital gains tax cut and dividend tax cut that expires this year. That's a tax cut for the rich.

I know you were going nuts over there... but there was a buttload of ppl there with guns loaded ready to shout down anyone criticizing the Bush economy and his spending.

</quote>

"We inherited built-in increases in entitlement spending" I believe was the popular refrain.

Sound familiar? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/banghead.gif"/>

I thought it was in reference to me proving I got a tax break. look up the brackets of 2008 vs 2000. not hard to do.

</quote>

You claimed it. I'm not doing your work for you. Prove your own claims.

LOL!!!!

</quote>

are you willing to point and click? is that too much work for you?

</quote>

Sure, give me a link to click on. PROVE YOUR OWN POINTS.

Show us that you are credible and we should believe the stuff you say.

I created LLC and trust organizations to run my business dealings through back in the early '90s. I get a fair amount of my end income out of that business structure in dividends, and I'm still nowhere near "rich".

Suffice to say you have NFI what you're talking about....Best quit while you're behind.
