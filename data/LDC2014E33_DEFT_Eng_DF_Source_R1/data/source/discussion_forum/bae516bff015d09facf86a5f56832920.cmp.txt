His over-reliance on diplomacy with Republicans has been costly for critical progress. That being said, I do think he is a good president Let me explain why I didn't choose the other options:

1) I think Obama shares the blame a little on the slow recovery of the economy, but I think there are many factors to be considered (i.e., congress)

2) I think his foreign policy has been great

3) Despite Solyndra, his energy policy has been quite successful

4) It was Bush that supercharged the defict (although some of the blame does go to Obama, too)

5) His taxation policy would have been great had it not been for what I chose out of this poll

6) National Security has undoubtedly been his best work (even Fox News can admit that).

Please explain your choice.

I picked the economy.

I picked it because instead of using his political capital at the beginning of his presidency to adress jobs, unemployment, the budget defecit, and the national debt he used up all that capital getting Obamacare passed.

The double whammy is Obamacare has actually, unlike it was intended to according to those who supported it, hurt the economy and the national debt along with cutting medicare.

If Obama had been even more antipathetic to Republicans than he already was, the backlash from the people would have been even stronger than the profound levels it reached in 2010.

Obama's version of bipartisanship is like an abusive parent offering their child candy while slapping them in the face.

It was a recipe for schizophrenic government, which is what we have now.

Obama is a failed leader.

The bias of your poll, Billy, was obvious. When I saw your longest entry, I guessed what your choice was without you explaining it.

Anyone claiming obama hasn't been partisan toward conservatives and republicans is either blind or a far left liberal.

I also picked the economy, for more or less those reasons.

If Obama had paid more attention to how the stimulus was used and to making HAMP work as he said it would, then the recovery could have been much more robust. What would have happened if Obama had taken his supposed zeal for infrastructure and actually put some effort into backing that in 2009?

Instead he neutralized most of the positive effect the stimulus and his other programs could have had by spending all that time on Obamacare. It has been a raincloud over the economy.

It's not a failure so much as a deception. Obama campaigned in 2008 as a progressive, and the people who voted him into office believed that's what he was. I remember being thrilled at how many small donations he was receiving, and thinking naively that maybe this was a way around corporate dominance of the government. Boy, was I wrong. Down the list, almost every "failure" of the Obama administration can be seen instead to be deliberate policy.

For example, Obama is believed by some to have shown weak leadership on health-care reform, letting Congress craft the bill for him. But when it looked like no reform was going to pass, he demonstrated that he had the ability to twist arms and guide the process to what he wanted. So what does that mean? It means that he let it go as long as it was going the way he wanted, and took an active role when it looked like it wasn't. He wasn't "weak" on this: he was corrupt. He got a health-care reform bill that his campaign contributors, who included health-insurance companies in large amounts, could be happy with. Obama is the reason we don't have a public option. If he'd intended there to be one, we would have one.

Look at who he appointed to key economic positions in his Cabinet: Wall Street cronies and tools, architects of center-right corporate-friendly economic policy, Clinton-era DLC retreads. The Republicans did not pressure him into appointing Geithner as Treasury Secretary, nor did he need their approval to do so. He did that on his own initiative.

Barack Obama is simply not the progressive friend of the people that he claimed to be in 2008. And THAT is his biggest failing.

Bingo.

As I said. Running for POTUS is a whole hell of a lot easier that being POTUS.Especially when you don't have the skills for it.
