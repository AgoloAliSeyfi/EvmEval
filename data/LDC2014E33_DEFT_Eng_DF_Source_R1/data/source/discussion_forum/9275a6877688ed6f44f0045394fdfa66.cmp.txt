LOL Obama said pretty much the same thing hack. Not to mention both presidents still pursued. The biggest difference is Obama sat on it for months afraid to pull the trigger.

Obama waited until the mission had the best chance of success.

He was right.

Booyah!

That's not completely true either. What he did was the build up a relationship with elements in the Pakistan ISI and military while rebuilding units that were completely devoted to taking out Bin Laden. This was a tricky and complicated set of operations that took a good amount of time to get to a point where it would have some level of achieving success. I am really quite surprised he gave the Bush administration any credit at all. But he did.

I sense fear from your lash out rant. Obama, "the manchild", would lose big in a one on one debate with ol' Newtie. No contest. He can't hide his gaffes, his hypocrisy on issues, his scandals on fast and furious, cronie capitalism on solyndra/sunpower/and his failed Keynesian approach to our economy. That alinsky/cloward-piven crap is running out of time.

I think michele should make a trip to target and stock on crybaby blankets and kleenix.

Is Newtie still in favor of Cap &amp; Trade? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_shhh.gif"/>

I'd be in favor of capping you, and trading you in for someone with a brain. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/clap2.gif"/>

So, is Newtie still in favor of Cap &amp; Trade?

This is mind blowingly stupid. Do you remember 9/11? Do you grasp that Clarke and Clinton were right about bin Laden, and Bush and Condi were wrong?

</quote>

No. Everyone wasn't wrong about bin Laden. Clarke was right. Bill Clinton was right. George Bush was wrong before 9/11. The people you're citing who attacked Clarke were wrong. They complained that Clarke kept coming in with his hair on fire---which means that he grasped the reality of the problem BEFORE 9/11. But in order to defend Bush, the right has been forced to attack Clarke for being overzealous...instead of having some degree of honesty and admitting that when Clarke's hair was on fire, Clarke was right.

Clinton was obsessed with bin Laden to the point that he was criticized for it.

<a href="http://www.snopes.com/rumors/clinton.asp">snopes.com: Clinton Administration and Terrorists</a>

As for Clinton passing on bin Laden, are you determined to bring up every right wing myth in existence in this thread? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Really? Doesn't that say something about you guys, then? You don't stand by your principles, you comprimise them because you want to win. Which is, of course, why you lost.

</quote>

Yes, it says that we are not rigid ideologues.

As for 'why we lost', that's pretty funny. Look at the crop of candidates that the Pubs have this go round....please, don't compromise your principles. Nominate Newt, and let him go down in flames. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_pray.gif"/>

Clarkes story changed depending upon the audience. That was clearly proven.

Alright back to your rant. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

"Waiting" implies that there was an infrastructure already set up for the operation. As in, all the dots were connected and Obama just simply had to wait on the "right time". That was not the case.
