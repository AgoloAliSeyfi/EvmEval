Here's some of the fun stuff. Bolded is mine.

It is of course, the global warming scam, with the (literally) trillions of dollars driving it, that has corrupted so many scientists, and has carried APS before it like a rogue wave. It is the greatest and most successful pseudoscientific fraud I have seen in my long life as a physicist. Anyone who has the faintest doubt that this is so should force himself to read the ClimateGate documents, which lay it bare. (Montfords book organizes the facts very well.) I dont believe that any real physicist, nay scientist, can read that stuff without revulsion. I would almost make that revulsion a definition of the word scientist.

The APS reply
<a href="http://www.aps.org/about/pressreleases/haroldlewis.cfm">http://www.aps.org/about/pressreleases/haroldlewis.cfm</a>

"On the matter of global climate change, APS notes that virtually all reputable scientists agree with the following observations:

* Carbon dioxide is increasing in the atmosphere due to human activity;
* Carbon dioxide is an excellent infrared absorber, and therefore, its increasing presence in the atmosphere contributes to global warming; and
* The dwell time of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is hundreds of years.

On these matters, APS judges the science to be quite clear. However, APS continues to recognize that climate models are far from adequate, and the extent of global warming and climatic disruptions produced by sustained increases in atmospheric carbon loading remain uncertain. In light of the significant settled aspects of the science, APS totally rejects Dr. Lewis claim that global warming is a scam and a pseudoscientific fraud."

Are we to believe they're incompetent or are politics involved?

Also I found this in the comment section:

I have heavily researched and thoroughly studied this subject matter for well over a decade, and I did so with the aide of a close acquaintance who's a department head at the USGS (A Climatologist), as well as with the great assistance of NOAA scientists. I can tell you, without a doubt, that NOTHING we are currently experiencing climate-wise is anywhere near the limits of historically proven fluctuations. Time and again, oceanic level studies, glacier core samples, and CO2 traces have proven beyond a doubt, that we are currently very fortunate to be on a mild crest of moderation within Earth's cyclic climatological track-record. For much of Earth's history, it was far hotter than now, and for much of Earth's history as well, it was also much colder.

If you look at organized human civilization for instance, it first emanated from a planet that was warming towards moderation. Such a facet never existed until our current climatological peak (Which came about thousands of years ago). We have had four global temperature peaks in the past 400,000 years, and all of organized civilization has only existed upon the current one (The fifth peak). Within this set peak, there are constant variances (Troughs and crests), but overall we should count ourselves very fortunate to be existing upon it at all! If anything, you should worry more about the next major glacial period, because, as proven throughout history, it will occur again (We will be the first organized civilization to face it as well, if we are still around that is).

The bottom line, is that the aforementioned set pattern proves the natural variances of Earth's cyclic climate drama. Combine that with the fact that we are currently well within the pre-established parameters, and human forcing becomes negligible at best, unmeasurable at worst.

Any truth to this or is it bunk?

As stated, it is bunk.
climate does not just randomly and without cause vary between extremes. Climate responds to and is the result of very specific but complexly interacting
factors. Though we are still learning the particulars of many of the interactions, we have robust understandings of most of the general factors and processes and can to a fair degree of accuracy assess and indicate the current situation, trends and causative factors/agencies.
