I'm sitting in a council house, on a council estate. When I was a kid I once played with a needle left by some junkies next to our house, someone got murdered almost outside my door last year, there's dealers everywhere... people get stabbed round here...

We never went on an overseas holiday until I was like 14, my rents couldn't afford a car until I was like 16...

Hardly middle class. We're not scrimping and saving, and running out of food, but neither of my parents have any savings or even a mortgage tbh.

Anyway, my mum makes £40k by herself, which hypothetically should go far, but doesn't because:

A) Had that wage for less than 2 years (she only finished her PGCE this year).
B) Single parent
C) Central London
D) She's being fecked over by this massive tax rebate.

This is a much longer reply than I planned. <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/> We're not poor, as in we can't afford food, can't go on school trips, no new shoes... but we're definitely not middle class.

why dont you move to north london, it is a lot cheaper...............
Also your mum is educated and a professional, therefore i still believe you are considered middle class. There are some upper class people who are poor in terms of wealth but due to the fact they are noble or have been born into a know upper class family they are still considered upper class.

With someone who has family going away on holiday for 2 weeks (Probably due to a stressful job) then he'd feel like a burden upon his family and that sort of thing I'd rather go through debts than have to put up with :/

And for example, I have a Middle Class family earning top bracket £60-80K a year but I also have 3 brothers and a sister to look after. My older brothers have moved out, although one of them is having a baby soon and the other is in Dubai and at the minute needs support while he sorts out his work. I have University in 2 years, my younger sister will go after me and my younger brother after. My parents can NOT afford to pay for 9 years of debt and tuition fees and there are some probably in even worse situations than mine!

The point is, just because the household income is this that and that, doesn't mean they can afford University. This is also something I disagree with EMAs, they don't take the amount of family that might need to be supported outside the household as well.

The point is, education is something the government "seems" (You never know in todays world :/) keen on, trying to get more and more people to University etc. But of course, this scheme puts a large proportion of Middle Class who I'm sure make up the majority of University students go through even MORE debts and that'll put more and more people off University and the number of applicants will DROP from the Middle Class, the Lower Class will expect to be able to get in without Tuition Fees and Universities will find themselves in MORE debt.

It's a short term solution which SHOULDN'T be put forward. If you agree with me, please join my facebook page at the top which will be used as a base of gathering support for my group. For others who are interested in knowing, facebook does provide an easy point to gather support and from there I can direct other actions and show my work is being listened to and supported. etc.

This, is basicaly the points I'm trying to get across in my terrible posts. I really should refrain from posting my garbage at 4am since half the time I look at it in the morning and think christ, did I really post that?

Because the proportion of people in the upper class is so small that charging them that little bit more won’t make a difference.

Why should those who can afford it pay more?

Because every home student's fee is subsidized such that government pays for the bulk of their education cost. That said, why shouldn’t they pay more for their own education if they can afford it?

Why give preference to underprivileged?

Because if you were born in a working class family I guarantee your sights will be set lower than Oxbridge if you intend to go to university at all. However, I am not sure if the way you outlined above is the best way to rectify the problem.

Middle class already pay more tax than the lower class. So technically upper class people who pay the most taxes, should pay less tuition fees. Not that they care... and they already use the private sector for most of the education anyway...
