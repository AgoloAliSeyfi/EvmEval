What you find contemptible about her is that she accused a conservative.

No, what I find contemptable is that she used this guy to advance herself, and then stabbed him in the back when that was advantageous. It lacks honor and decency. That goes beyond partisanship.

Ask some of the RW people about me. Half of them think I'm a liberal because I don't toe the idealogical line. I'm just as critical of Republicans and Democrats- when they deserve it.

Well, if she said, "Clarance, Great Guy" like everyone else who was asked about Judge Thomas by the FBI, she wouldn't have gotten supeoned. Instead she said, "Ummm, he said something bad once, what a bad guy... you aren't going to put my name to this, are you? I might need another letter of recommendation."

Iran Contra HELPED the nation. Got our hostages out, helped defeat the Commie Sandinistas... Are you kidding?

Actually, going back to your psychic powers bullshit, how did those mean old Republcans actually make Clinton lie?

Here's how Clinton could have avoided problems.

"Did you get a blow job from Monica".
"Yeah."

Problem solved. Now, Hillary might have brained him with an ashtray, but he wouldn't have been in legal trouble. Or better yet, he could have settled with Jones when she was only asking for a third of what she eventually got and an apology.

Please be logical. The CIA says that she was covert. You are acting as if because no one could be convicted, she becomes non-covert.

Valerie Plame was a covert agent at the time she was outed. The CIA has verified this.

I always find it hysterically funny when a leftist suddenly develops a love for the CIA. No, really. After years of thinking the CIA is putting microchips in their butts, they suddenly loooooove the CIA when it has a problem with Bush.

Let's be blunt. This was intergency office politics... and it was bullshit. The CIA told Bush, "It's a slam dunk, Mr. President" on WMD's. Then there weren't any WMD's and the fingerpointing started. Please.

She becomes "non-covert" because no one was actually charged with that. Because her name was publically out there where even Nancy Drew could have figured out who she was. It isn't covert when half the reporters and politicians in Washington knows you work at the CIA and you sent your house husband off on a junket because he looked bored around the house.

Here's the gag about Joe Wilson. In Febuary of 2003, he wrote an op-ed where he not only said he believed Saddam had WMD's, but we shouldn't invade because he might use them. So much for him knowing the "truth".

<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/06/opinion/oe-wilson6">A 'Big Cat' With Nothing to Lose - Los Angeles Times</a>

But after it all goes south and it looks like they might start firing people at the CIA, he goes public that he "knew" there were no WMD's, and people asked, "Who the heck is Joe Wilson?"

Yeah. From what I've read Plame was the best "unkept" secret in DC. She was no more covert than I am. Her last assignment in Russia was a bust. They had to send her home because the Russkies knew who she was. She was assigned desk duty thereafter. Can't be covert when the enemy has you pegged.

As for WMD's Hell. Every intelligence agency in the world thought Saddam had em and thats what the invasion was based on. Incorrect intel from everyone.

How covert can you be when you and your husband are plastered all over his website along with where you work and what you do? That was one huge scam from the word go and designed to embarrass certain people, which as far as the MSM was concerned, did. Even when the bogus 'leak' was revealed as an inside CIA thing, the MSM still tried to keep the illusion alive that it was Bush, Cheney &amp; Co. who orchestrated the whole thing. But we have a MSM that is considerably less than honest and ethical.

Yep. To bad they didn't do as thorough a job on Barry as they did on Bush, Cheney and company.

Imagine sending 200 reporters to Alaska to try to dig up dirt on a woman running for the VP slot on the GOP ticket. Those same 200 could have done some digging on Barry Boy when he was running for POTUS.

Honest and ethical?? Our MSM ain't even in the ballpark.

Thanks for proving my point about you being an ignorant shitstain too lazy to think and separate rumor from reality. Because EVERY intelligent person looks to a man's EX-WIFE for "the truth" about him. Sure they do. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_hand.gif"/>

Sit down and shut the fuck up before you humiliate yourself further, fucktard.

Denial is not just a river in Egypt. That's not just from the ex-wife. It's from people who worked with him. Newt has admitted to most of what you would deny. And he came up with a wacky excuse for it. He just loved the country too much. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/rofl.gif"/>

Newt is not stable.

</quote>

Perhaps you'd like to show me where Newt admitted to anything other than having an affair on his second wife. See if you can do it using REAL news sources, rather than blogs. Amazingly enough, just because someone says it on the Internet, that doesn't make it true.

Does he have a "One Free Affair" card?
