I think the delay was caused by the EPA. The skimmer works by skimming oil and water, filtering the oil and discharging the water back into the sea. The EPA's concern was the amount of oil contained in water being pumped back into the sea. Hopefully that has been resolved.

This is absolutely sickening. What in God's name is going on with the Federal Government? The Obama administration?

The world's largest oil skimmer has sat immobile for weeks on end as the BP Oil leak gushed. Obama golfed. Obama wined and dined. Obama fundraised. Obama wagged his finger at BP.

For the last 66 days the entire American skimming effort has resulted in 600,000 gallons of oil skimmed. The projected capabilities of the "A-Whale" skimmer is 500,000 gallons PER DAY.

Are Americans simply suffering from an incredibly inept and self-involved White House, or is it something even more dubious...?

The A-Whale bills itself as the largest open-water oil skimmer in the world, and its at least very impressive. Originally an oil and ore tanker, the ships owners recently refitted the ship to do exactly the kind of work that the US so desperately needs in the Gulf of Mexico, and to do it on a vastly larger scale than current operations can handle. According to the ships project manager, the entire American effort in 66 days has skimmed off 600,000 barrels of oil. The ships owners claim that A-Whale can skim 500,000 barrels a day

So where is the A-Whale now? In the Gulf? Not yet. Its on its way there after being tied to a dock in Norfolk, Virginia, and wont be allowed to join the cleanup effort until the Coast Guard and the EPA figure out whether it meets their standards

...Overton blasted BP and the federal government for a lack of effort and coordination in their dual oil-spill response and made a plea to the government to allow the A Whale to join the cleanup operation.

... This, by the way, is Day 68 of the Gulf crisis. The A-Whale didnt get refitted on Day 66; this work had to have been done over months, if not years. Shouldnt the government have known about the existence of this ship two months ago, and been working on certifying it immediately? The A-Whale shouldnt have had to stop at Norfolk at all to get the nations attention, but should have been hired to steam directly to the Gulf and get to work immediately. Its indicative of a crisis management team that is spending more time worrying about regulations and red tape than cleaning up the mess, just as we saw with Packgens boom.
