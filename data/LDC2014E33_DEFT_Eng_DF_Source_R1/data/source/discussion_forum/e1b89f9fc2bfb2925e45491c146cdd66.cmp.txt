The ends do justify the means. It's not selling your country. It's called asking for help when you need it and thinking about your people and looking above your pride. Some problems will naturally arise but these can be dealt with as time moves on. The biggest problems will be dealt with which is important and a few small or medium sized might come up but at least we dealt with the biggest. I know if western countries help Somalia it's not going to be out of good will and such, Somalia is going to have to become the 110th state or something like that. It doesn't sound too bad. There mostly going to want cooperation.

I am disappointed by your reading skills. <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/> When I was talking about the architect, I was criticising the mentality of the people. The fact that they didn't utilize what was given to them rather just destroyed it without having the means to build another. I stated 'a world with colonization or a world without'. Colonization has undoubtedly helped advanced humanity and we needed it and in some cases still do. Are you seriously trying to suggest that a world without colonization would've been better? Really? Come on. Being idealistic again me thinks.

I couldn't care less if I embarrass myself or not, to be honest. This is a debate and in a debate people make mistakes, I am not above making mistakes. However, you're not doing yourself any favours by telling me to 'read a history book' which is so vague it's unbelievable. If I stated something wrong, correct it in a concise manner otherwise... You're right Somalia didn't go downhill from day one of the independence, it was already downhill and continued as such. This is all what I would like to happen soon.

However, I doubt that this would happen judging by the world we live in. The actions of your consequences are worse than the actions of my consequences. As I stated before, it's very, very probable that Al-qadea will move their base to Somalia and hey ho America joins them. I don't need to tell you what will happen then because I am sure your mind can conjure what will happen when one of the weakest armies in the modern (and heck the historical) world tries to take one of the most powerful armies this world has ever seen.

Even if Al-qadea for some reason don't move to Somalia, if al-shabab control and terror continues which is likely given how they're strengthening everyday, the US will see it as a threat and will deal with that threat. They don't even have to send armies to do it, they could just bomb the **** out of the region and then move in and take out the remaining. This is the reality.

I don't get why the bolded is confounding?

I think it's pretty self-explanatory tbh.
You believe Somalians are too inferior to take concern or have any compassion. In essence, they are sub-human. Hence, I have little interest.

Ciao.

There is no such thing as 'Somalians' but Somalis.

So, if you're all so concerned, what's the point of making threads on TSR? Why don't you head over to Somalia and raise your voices there and make a change? <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

I am disappointed by your reading skills too. If you read, i wrote 'Somalians are humans..'. I was stating that greed is a part of human nature. This going by your post would mean I'm implying humans are sub-humans which is nonsensical because if not by the standards of humanity, what standards are you using to make such a assertion? Read before making such accusations.

A militant islamist group in somalia has passed a law which prevents men and women from shaking hands or socialising in public. I know this is not uncommon in conservative islamic societies, but is it a reason for us in the “liberal west” to be concerned? It has made news around the world, but is this due to the unstable nature of somalia and its associated problems or rather the worry of increasing islamist ideology and rise of islamist groups?

For those conservative muslims in the west; I’m sure most of you shake the hands of the opposite sex if presented. How much of an issue is it? Are we making a big deal out of it, or is there good reason as to why men and women shouldn’t have physical contact (ie. shaking hands).

I'm not a Muslim, but I respect Islam. But still this sort of stuff I can't understand. But then you need to consider that there is not 1 Islam. There are 73 or so sects of Islam. The one that did this law is probably the more extremist ones, which would probably also never allow people to:

* sing
* listen to music
* dance
* make friendships with non-Muslims

and so on

I believe it is an issue with Islam rather than Somalia, but then again only with certain types of Muslims.
