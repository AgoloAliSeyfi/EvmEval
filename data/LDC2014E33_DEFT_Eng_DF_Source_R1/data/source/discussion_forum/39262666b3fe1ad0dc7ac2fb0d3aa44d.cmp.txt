Plenty of left-wing people supported the war in Iraq as a matter of internationalism, democracy, secularism, anti-fascism and a bunch of other good left-wing values. Most notable among them were the secular, leftist Iraqi and Kurdish opposition groups which were the groups most vehemently pushing for regime change. Are you telling me that Iraqi socialists who supported the war are not left-wing any more because they found themselves having to side with George Bush?

I am sure those Iraqis who supported regime change got more than they bargained for.

So you support the west going to other countries to change the way those people live there?

Perhaps you will not be so offended when the muslims try and push for Sharia law in the UK? Afterall why don't they have the right to try and change our society if we intend to change theirs?

Way to change the subject of the possibility of left-wingers supporting the war.

Yes I support changing the way people live in other countries if the way they live is under the jackboot of a genocidal tyrant. That sounds like a pretty ****** way to live to me.

I haven't met (or read an article by) a single left wing person who supported the war in Iraq. Frankly I think you made it up.

You forget it was this genocidal tyrant who was put in by the west aswell.

The message from the west? we don't care how people live in the world as long as their leaders do as we say. However if we need to change the way we live we will campaign udner a banner of democracy and secularism...

Then idiots like you eat it up.

I'd say the true definition of an anti-Semite is someone who quite clearly hates Jews, and, in order to convince himself of its legitimacy, changes the meaning of anti-Semitism altogether - as you clearly have just done.

I support Iranian nuclear advancement in civilian and military fields. Judging by people like you and Tony Blair I am making a wise judgement. Iran's security will only be established with nuclear arms

Those same wikileaks also revealed the large amount of purposeful civilian murder by British and American troops. Something I am sure you did not get as passionate about.

3. Israel exists on the basis that a pretend fairytale claims that Israel is the land of the Jews. This is ridiculous no fairytale can claim any land belongs to anyone. I might write a book which claims Israel belongs to the mexican people and they are the chosen people. My book would be equally as legitimate.

On this fairytale basis The palestinian people were driven from their land and into ghettos where they are treated as sub human.

Will you support a war against Israel to help these people?

So if I am wrong why was Israel created and why was it created on that land? Why do the people of Palestine have to suffer because of a fairytale?

Lets face it, any discussion with you is worthles you're a right wing nutjob. You probably think George Bush is a hero.

It takes a special kind of right wing extremist to support the Iraq war after all that happened. Well done for being a failure.
