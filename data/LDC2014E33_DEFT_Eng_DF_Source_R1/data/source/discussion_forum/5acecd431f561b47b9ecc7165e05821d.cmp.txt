The you are wrong. Paul himself condemns the old laws specifically circumcision amongst others. And the Jews do not expect gentiles to follow them, nor do they themselves, being as they don't have the death penalty in Israel, and of course homosexuality is legal.

You can't pick and chose out of 250 OT laws roughly, that's nonsense. Take a slave much do you? Stone blasphemers to death, burn people who sleep with their in laws at the stake? Wear two different cloths?

However, the Bible is very clear when it comes to the authority of the law in this age. We can learn from it, for it teaches us many things. However, we are free from the rules and regulations of this law. Let us look at some of the proofs for this teaching in scripture.

1. The Bible clearly states that we are not under the law. Romans 6:14 says, "For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace." Since we are under grace, we are not under the law. The two are mutually exclusive.
2. Jesus Christ has delivered us from the curse of the law (Galatians 3:10-13). Those who "are of the works of the law are under the curse" (v.10) But "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law" (v.13). We come to God by faith and "the law is not of faith" (v.12).
3. Before faith came (clear faith in the person of Jesus Christ), we were kept under the law (Galatians 3:23). The "law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ" (v.24). "But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster" (v.25). How much clearer could it be? We are no longer under the Mosaic law as a rule of practice.
4. In Galatians, Paul goes even further. The very desire to be under the law is a carnal desire. He calls the Galatians "foolish" for trying to return to the practices of the law as a way to please God (Galatians 3:1-3). In Galatians 4:21-31, he tells an allegory to those "that desire to be under the law" (v.21). He concludes that those who follow the law are "children of the bondwoman" (v.31), but those who follow faith are "free." Paul is not dealing here with the law as a plan for salvation. He is dealing with those who have trusted in Christ and then desire to return to the law in order to please God.
5. The council in Jerusalem in Acts 15 plainly stated that the requirements of the law were not to be exacted from Gentile believers. It also clearly states that Jews must come to Christ in the same way that Gentiles get saved--"But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they" (v.11). The problem came when certain of the Pharisees decided that the Gentiles who had believed must be circumcised and keep the law of Moses (v.5). The men at the conference (including Peter, Paul, Barnabas, and James the brother of Jesus) agreed that this was not to be required of the Gentiles. Peter even accused the Pharisees of tempting God, "to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear" (v.10). Evidently, it is tempting God to require grace age believers to keep the Jewish regulations of the law.
6. Paul specifically excludes circumcision as a requirement for New Testament believers. See Galatians 5:1-6; 6:15.
7. We are not subject to the particular restrictions of the law. Colossians 2:16-17 states, "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath days: Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ." the Jewish laws were shadows of things to come. That is, they pointed to Christ. But now that Jesus Christ has come, there is no need to hold on to the shadow.

Did you seriously just use the phrase 'cure' homosexuality? In the sense of it being an illness? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/confused.gif" alt=":confused:"/>

I think he is rather suggesting that it is ridiculous to think that it is a disease- 'anyone with any sense etc.'

That's kind of harsh - now, I'm not religious nor do I believe in marriage in any way but other people do and it's people like you that make them afraid to come out in some way. That's how it appears.
