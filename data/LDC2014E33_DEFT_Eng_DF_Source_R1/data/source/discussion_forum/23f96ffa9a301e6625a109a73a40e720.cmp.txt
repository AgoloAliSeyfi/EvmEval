I propose:

The European Union is a political union of countries and unions on the European continent.

The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a political union comprised of 4 countries ( England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland )

Great Britain is comprised of 3 countries ( England, Scotland and Wales )

These countries are comprised of counties, which are comprised of cities, towns and villages.

These are matters of fact, regardless of the organisation of other countries and/or unions.

Please, discuss.

I will give £10 to a charity of your choice if you can do it.

P.S. Recognition by FIFA or any other sporting organisation doesn't count.

Indeed, we only have 'home nation' teams because England and Scotland had their own F.A.s before FIFA was formed.

And even FIFA acknowledges this is an exception:

1 Any Association which is responsible for organising and supervising
football in its country may become a Member of FIFA. In this
context, the expression “country” shall refer to an independent state
recognised by the international community. Subject to par. 5 and par.
6 below, only one Association shall be recognised in each country.

...

5 Each of the four British Associations is recognised as a separate
Member of FIFA.
6 An Association in a region which has not yet gained independence
may, with the authorisation of the Association in the country on
which it is dependent, also apply for admission to FIFA.

So even FIFA doesn't consider the parts of the UK to be countries, it just has an exception to allow the UK to enter 4 teams.
