Now once the children become celebs on their own they are free game.
The Bush twins have not pursued this angle however one Palin child has.
And she dances like a horse.

Really?? So are you going to claim that Trig...Willow etc became a celeb on theri own then? Because the nastynesshas not been not just aimed at Bristol. Also care to explain the nastyness that came from your side prior to DWTS? You do know it was heaped on them before that...right? Sorry...you lose.

Boxer and Di Fi?

Amy Carter when she was but a child?

No, I don't Please elaborate.

On his TV show, early in the Clinton administration, Limbaugh put up a picture of Socks, the White House cat, and asked, 'Did you know there's a White House dog?' Then he put up a picture of Chelsea Clinton, who was 13 years old at the time and as far as I know had never done any harm to anyone.

When viewers objected, he claimed, in typical Limbaugh fashion, that the gag was an accident and that without his permission some technician had put up the picture of Chelsea -- which I found as disgusting as his original attempt at humor.

Funny, I seem to remember a recent thread about how ugly black women are. Hmmm, maybe it was only racist?

Sure she made herself a public figure by her choice and action.

Same as you have rights to criticize Pelosi or hanoi Jane, etc.
