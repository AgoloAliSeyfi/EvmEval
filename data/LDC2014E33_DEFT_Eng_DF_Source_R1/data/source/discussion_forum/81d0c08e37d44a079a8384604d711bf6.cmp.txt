I agree with everything Cat said. First of all, who the Hell plays xbox who's over age 14? Personal insults aside, though, he is being incredibly immature, and his buddies are just egging him on. He needs to know that YOU and your BABY are his first priority, and his friends have no right to an opinion.

I know that you've been struggling with a lot of debt, too. Ask him if he wants his baby to grow up the same way he did, if he wants to be dependent on his in-laws forever (can his manhood take THAT??). Tell him about all the things you want to do for your kid (own a house where he has his own room with a yard to play in, pay for him to go to summer camps, sign him up for a soccer team, save up a college fund--Hell, just to be able to pay for new shoes when he grows out of his old ones), all the things that will be impossible if he doesn't get his act together. Not paying bills doesn't make them go away! He needs to make a budget--pay the bills, buy the food, save up for a place of your own.

I'd tell him he has 3 months. Stick to a budget: prioritize and pay the bills, no new toys. If he can do that, you'll stay with him as long as he continues to be financially responsible. If he can't, say you'll see him in court. Yes, you love him, but you have to think of your baby; part of being a good father is being responsible. I don't doubt that he loves you, but he needs to learn that he can't be fiscally reckless and expect things to turn out okay. Once the baby is born, you can collect the 33% of his paycheck when it's mailed to you, you can get a job, and you can start a new life--pay off bills, get your own place, and take care of your kid the way the kid deserves.

If his buddies have anything to say on the matter, point out to them that your husband lives on the charity of his in-laws, isn't earning enough to even pay for rent for an apartment, let alone food or utilities: what kind of man can't even take care of his pregnant wife? What kind of man chooses to buy toys for himself before paying off the debt that's in the way of moving out of his wife's mother's house? What kind of man plays xbox all day instead of working a real job? What the Hell kind of man buys a toy with the very last $60 to his name, not to mention that he has a family to support? His friends won't like it that you're standing up to them, and your husband REALLY won't like you talking to them about that--hopefully you'll get them to shut up, and you'll get him to stop telling them about things that aren't their business.

I get really fed up with people when they act like sullen hormonal teenagers, especially when they're harming more than just themselves. Your husband needs a serious wake-up call, slap in the face, and reality check. However you phrase it, he needs to step up. I get so angry every time I read any post you write about your husband.

I'm fuming right now. I'll stop before my post deteriorates into an endless string of unintelligible profanities...

I was going to put my two cents in, but I think everyone already did a good enough job! I agree with all of the other girls.. <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

He needs to man up and support his family, not his game addiction. <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/mad.gif"/>
