Why is it that Americans will bend over backwards to appease the Islam country's? Why is that we must walk around such issues like the 9/11 Mosque, and the Florida Quran bonfire? Is it from fear of an attack from a peaceful religion, It's a known fact they have killed Americans before without any provocation in the past. Like some of these attacks from the following link.

Not sure how we appease Islamic countries.

No one is walking around the mosque issue. Hell, its been a huge discussion for both sides of the issue. Theres nothing wrong with that. Thats the American way.

The Florida Quran burning has been the hot button issue of the last two weeks. Not walking around that.

To say people fear something because they discuss events is just not correct. To hate another people because of their religious beliefs is fear.

Im not afraid of anothers religious belief or color or creed or sexual preference. I love America and fear nothing.

Glad to hear that you do not fall into the media and obama hype of fear. If the crazy preac hers burns a few Muslim books so what If they get piss so what? If they kill so what? That was their plan all along. They do not need a reason to kill.

It is all about an election cycle. You see the Liberals think they can blame the Republicans for the opposition to the Mosque and the Koran Burning and win political points. They will say or do ANYTHING at this point cause they know they are in deep trouble.

Bullshit. On September 17, 2001, George W. Bush gave this speech. Muslim hatred has zero to do with "election cycles." He knew, as does President Obama, that it serves no good purpose to enflame an entire population because of the behavior of a few.

Yup that was when Bush decided to lie rather than educate.
Sad moment, a disgrace really.

Perhaps because we are supposed to be the 'adults' on the planet. Maybe because Christianity got this sort of mess out of its system when it was also about 1400 years old. Perhaps because we are supposed to be the ones who have found a place for religion somewhere below the mystic. Perhaps because we understand that two wrongs (or three) don't make a single right. Perhaps it's simply because, we prefer to hold individuals accountable for their actions and not the group they come from.

According to the IMAM behind the Mosque they can not move it, Because moving it will lead to anger, hate, and violence around the world.

From so called Tolerant, peaceful Muslims.

LOL

So? He should know. Do you think peaceful Muslims aren't aware of what's going on with the non-peaceful brethren?
