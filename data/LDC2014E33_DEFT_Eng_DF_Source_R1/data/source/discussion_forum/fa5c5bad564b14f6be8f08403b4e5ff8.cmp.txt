Speaking of fun, it's Friday night. I hope all you folks in Cowtown can join all of us slack-jawed hicks, grab your guns, head to church, and hope the preacher has a good anti-immigrant sermon that will relieve all this bitterness we feel.

So Stella, what is your excuse for the bitterness you are obviously clinging onto like a saftey-blanket? Is it the uncontrollable vaginal stench constantly creeping from your constant queffs? Hate to break it to you, but there's no patchouli on Earth that is going to mask that steaming gutter pile of noxious rotting cooch. But, on the bright side, I hear the smell of decomposing flesh makes Ralph Nader hot and horny, so you're all good with tin-hat crowd.

Your post displays the same condescending contempt as your Obamessiah.
"You go into these small towns in Pennsylvania, and like alot of small towns in the Midwest, the jobs have been gone for 25 years and nothing has replaced them. And it's not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion and antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations." Sen. Barack Obama, San Francisco fundraiser, 4/06/2008.

I knew exactly what you were refering to, again, what's your excuse for your bitterness?

Also, it's hillariously ironic for a Naderite to accuse someone else of having a messianic devoition to a candidate.

Your Poli-Sci 101 spin does not hide Obama's stereotyping, which unfortunately reinforces the blue collar perception of the Democrat party as controlled by elitists, and could be the reason they will end up losing the election.
Disappointment, not bitterness would better describe my feelings. The Democrats inability to nominate an electable candidate for President will end up blowing a golden opportunity.

Your Naderassiac devotional spin doesn't hide your blatant bias. What, exactly, in Obama's comments is incorrect? Sometimes the people need to hear truth that is uncomfortable to digest. Uncomfortability with reality doesn't make words untrue, but I'd like for you to explain to me what is untrue in Obama's comments.
