China a surprise leader in clean energy: study

October 19, 2010 by Amy Coopes <a href="http://cdn.physorg.com/newman/gfx/news/hires/chinasinvest.jpg">Enlarge</a>
Wind power turbines are seen in Dali, China's southwestern Yunnan province. The world's top polluter, China, is a surprise leader in clean energy efforts, a study showed Tuesday, outstripping the United States and Japan and leaving Australia lagging far behind.
The world's top polluter, China, is a surprise leader in clean energy efforts, a study showed Tuesday, outstripping the United States and Japan and leaving Australia lagging far behind.

The Vivid Economics report, commissioned by Australia's Climate Institute thinktank, showed <a href="http://www.physorg.com/tags/china/">China</a> was second only to Britain in the value of its incentives to cut pollution from <a href="http://www.physorg.com/tags/electricity+generation/">electricity generation</a>.
Britain's efforts were estimated at 29.30 US dollars per tonne of carbon to China's 14.20 US dollars, with the <a href="http://www.physorg.com/tags/united+states/">United States</a> clocking 5.10, Japan 3.10, Australia 1.70 and just 70 US cents for South Korea.
The six countries account for just under half of all global emissions.
"The Chinese leadership have made a strategic decision that they missed out on the last two industrial revolutions and they don't want to miss out on the third one," said Erwin Jackson, director of the Climate Institute, of China's "surprising" dominance.
"They are now commanding the largest market share of clean energy investment at a global level as a result," Jackson told AFP.
China's investment in clean energy topped 35 billion US dollars in 2009 compared with 11 billion in Britain and 18 billion in the United States, and Jackson said it was set to increase tenfold over the next decade.
The main driver of China's performance was its commitment to shutting down more than 100 small coal-fired power plants for cleaner coal stations by 2011, which the report said would reduce emissions by 15 percent.

Arctic temperature rising at near record rates, sea ice melting faster: report

Randolph E. Schmid

Washington The Associated Press

Published Thursday, Oct. 21, 2010 3:15PM EDT

The temperature is rising again in the Arctic, with the sea ice extent dropping to one of the lowest levels on record, climate scientists reported Thursday.

The new Arctic Report Card tells a story of widespread, continued and even dramatic effects of a warming Arctic, said Jackie Richter-Menge of the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers facility.

This isn't just a climatological effect. It impacts the people that live there, she added.

Atmospheric scientists concerned about global warming focus on the Arctic because that is a region where the effects are expected to be felt first, and that has been the case in recent years.

Has anyone mentioned Gavin Schmidt's recent article "Taking the Measure of the Greenhouse Effect" up over at the GISS site? ( <a href="http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/schmidt_05/">http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/schmidt_05/</a> )

... Thus, the total greenhouse effect after a change in CO2 needs to account for the consequent changes in the other components as well. If, for instance, CO2 concentrations are doubled, then the absorption would increase by 4 W/m2, but once the water vapor and clouds react, the absorption increases by almost 20 W/m2  demonstrating that (in the GISS climate model, at least) the "feedbacks" are amplifying the effects of the initial radiative forcing from CO2 alone. Past climate data suggests that this is what happens in the real world as well.

What happens when the trace greenhouse gases are removed? Because of the non-linear impacts of CO2 on absorption, the impact of removing the CO2 is approximately seven times as large as doubling it. If such an event were possible, it would lead to dramatic cooling, both directly and indirectly, as the water vapor and clouds would react. In model experiments where all the trace greenhouse gases are removed the planet cools to a near-Snowball Earth, some 35°C cooler than today, as water vapor levels decrease to 10% of current values, and planetary reflectivity increases (because of snow and clouds) to further cool the planet.

Despite being a trace gas, there is nothing trivial about the importance of CO2 for today, nor its role in shaping climate change in the future.

to build 24 large-scale coal mines and eight clusters of coal-fired power plants

</quote>
Wow, that's a lot isn't it.
24 large-scale coal mines AND eight clusters (how many in a cluster one wonders) of coal fired power plants.

And you want how many closed down in (say) Australia? <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/>
