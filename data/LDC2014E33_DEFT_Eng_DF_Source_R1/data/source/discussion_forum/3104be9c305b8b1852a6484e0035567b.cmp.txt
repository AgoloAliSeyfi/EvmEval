I keep hearing about these "failed economic policies". Anyone have any idea what specific Bush economic policies they're talking about?

Taking from the poor and giving to the rich.

When you cut taxes for a group of people, someone else has to make up for it. Guess who that is?

But, it honestly doesn't matter. Anything he did is completely overshadowed by this bailout frenzy that I will have to pay off for the rest of my life.

Pity this descended into sloganeering so quickly.

let's start with No Child Left Behind. I must first say that I'm giving an intuitive response based on what I've heard in my area. This is not easy research, but I'll look into it while people respond (edit: cited criticisms added at bottom).

Most of the teachers and a lot of parents in my state have issues with the economic result of this policy. Basically, the federal government saves money by not spending it on education by making it more difficult to get funding for education for each state.

Of course, certain states hold power over the federal government (by their lobby force or they have the people on their side or however) so they can maintain good funding from the feds. They wouldn't have a problem with No Child Left Behind.

There's also likely states who naturally fit the requirements.

WIKI's CITED CRITICISMS:

Gaming the System (faculty manipulating student test scores for more funding)
Incentives against low performing students (this one should be obvious)
State Cuts (states that receive federal funding for education cut back too far on their own education spending, often outweighing the funding with cuts!)
Narrows Curriculum (obvious)

Also, are there any policies that aren't economic? Policy decides who gets what.

Bush decided (and tricked congress if you recall) that our tax dollars should go towards a War on Terrorism. [speculation] He wanted the US to take the whole burden and go swooping in instead of waiting for a plan, either to be heroes or to cover up something before our allies picked it up, or just to take the biggest claim in the plunder?

By the way, this is basically a blank check if you speculate on "Emergency Powers", but let's pretend I didn't say that and just look at something like this:[/speculation]

The Protect America Act is an act that takes away our privacy so that the federal government can protect us from terrorism (that's stated outright by the bill). The reality is that it basically allows warantless searching and spying in our own country.

<a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/31203res20070807.html">here</a> 's a biased fact sheet (i.e. they are facts, but only the ones supporting my side). Think about this though... if you're browsing the internet and you go to a foreign site, the federal government is probably tracking your history (of course, they're not analyzing your data because they don't care about your porn addiction or that you look up how to grow hydroponics... or do they?) Most likely, they're just passively recording your information.

Now, this doesn't worry me because I don't have anything to hide, but it's still kind of creepy that we keep going this direction of reduced privacy for increased security. How is it a failed economic policy? That's our tax dollars being spent on creeping me out.
