So the Government says that scans will not be stored or transmitted, that our privacy is sacred, but then it goes and puts in purchase orders for scanners that must be able to do both. Does anyone doubt but that these abilities that are built into the scanners will be used ?

If it means I no longer have to take off my shoes, who cares? We fly a lot and I always hate having to take off my shoes.

Since these new scanners can give a pretty detailed view of the human body under clothes, wouldnt they in some way violate child porn laws?

After all, kids would also have to go thru the scanners, wouldn they?

@Irishk,

The shoes don't bother me. I'm just grateful we haven't have a bra bomber.

@Green Witch,

oh snap...

now why had I not thought to generate a panic in that direction before?

GW, you are brilliant.

(and being a TSA flunky would become more popular, I think...)

@Green Witch,

After the last time I flew, I've been forever grateful I didn't have metallic snaps in my shorts. That thing was detecting everything.
