Okay, JM, I'll go point by point:

You're welcome.

I disagree with your assessment of Mr. Bond and his statements.

Well, I thought I had given my own thoughts in my post directly before yours. I will add that I agree the 'noble cause of AA" has problems, but, given the fact that there doesn't seem to be any better way of dealing with the severity of the situation, I will argue for AA over doing nothing because of the enormity of the problem which, IMHO, needs to be (1) addressed and (2) redressed.

If you have any more questions of me, please do not hesitate to ask.

Respectfully,

SweetC

Equality and AA
dyslexia: (post of Sun, 6/13

You said "Until every man, woman and child, regardless of race, color or ethnicity gets the same shot at success, I will continue to support AA efforts made in that direction, faulted as they may be."

1. Was Gwyneth Paltrow helped because her father was a producer-director?

2. How about Kate Hudson? Not only is she the daughter of Goldie Hawn, but she also is a fantastic looking woman -- as judged by many in US. Did my daughter have the "same shot at success" -- given my lower income plus my "un-hollywood" looks.

3. Since AA (as the Supreme C. means it) discriminates against a white baby born today, then that white baby will not have the "same shot at success". Therefore, you will support AA forever as the very license to discriminate is in the S.C. decision.

4. The S.C. decision is an elitist position. The wealthy will always get their children into good schools. When the citizens have a chance to vote on AA, they vote against the concept over-whelmingly.

5. Last thoughts on other classifications: Do all babies have the same intelligence? Do all families let their children watch TV the same amount of time? How about handicaps? musical ability to get int Julliard?

These last comments ignore the continuing privilege which white people afford to one another in a society which remains overwhelmingly white european protestant. I'm not sure that this justifies affording access simply on the basis of race, but the recent decision by the Supremes was two part, and struck down the general admissions policy of the University of Michigan, saying that race could be used, as one factor in many, and not as a sole, a priori determinant factor. I'd like to know where Donlasv comes up with the statment: "When the citizens have a chance to vote on AA, they vote against the concept over-whelmingly." Got something to back that up--i don't recall this ever having been the subject of a national referendum, and am curious to know to what you refer.

Kate Hudson and Gwyneth Paltrow indeed! The issue is inequality in education from pre-school on up. In spite of what the Bushboys say, the education system in Texas is unequal...

Whatever the color of your skin (what a criterion! ye gods!), if you pull the wrong straw when you're born and you wind up in a series of underfunded deeply rural schools or underfunded deeply urban schools, you're in trouble. If you add to that parents who can't, for whatever reason, contribute to your education (with help, attention, money, support, interest), you're "left behind." We've developed a habit of mind in this "no child left behind" nation that some people Just Aren't Worth It. Many of those believe that a dark skin means you're inherently dumber anyway, less worthy, so why bother. They get all frothy with indignation when remedies are proposed. I suggest they shut up and concentrate on providing a uniformly superb public education from pre-school onward in all areas, at all times, for all children, now and without fail. I think we should all do that. Perhaps an education equal to our resources (we're the most fortunate nation in the world but still have a low-rated educational system) will finally erase misperceptions that dedicated bubbas have -- indeed, eliminate bubba-ism altogether. After all, bubbas grew up victims of lousy education too or they wouldn't be bubbas.

Hating and wanting to get rid of AA is like hating and wanting to get rid of Mylanta when, if you were able to eat right, Mylanta wouldn't be needed.

Statina and Tartarin: Good comments all.

Sweetcomplication, I suppose that in saying that it would be better to live in a society that is educated, I was trying to appeal to AU's conservative instincts. That fact notwithstanding, I want the educated society for the benefit of all citizens.

If I could make the rules concerning who would be educated, I'd hope that if the following week, by some irony of the gods, I were turned into a single black woman with six children in high school, I would be be happy, in my new state, with the rules I had made in my more waspish incarnation.
