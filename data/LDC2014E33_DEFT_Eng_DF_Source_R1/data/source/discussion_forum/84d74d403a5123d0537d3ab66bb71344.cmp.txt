After the carnage was unleashed U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey concluded:

"certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945 [the date U.S. forces were to invade.], Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated."

Okay, this apparently is the POV you hold. The rest of the post you made contains the regrets and hindsight of men and women involved in the decision to use the A-Bomb on Japan....and I have no trouble believing they carried a powerful sense of conflict and regret over that choice till they died. They would not have been human if they did not. I seem to recall even Einstein regretted invention of the A-Bomb.

But emotion alone does not control the questions of ethics and the A-Bomb.

Personally I think it is irrelevant whether or not Japan had a "superior economic/political system" to the US's in 1945. I don't happen to believe that they did, but either side in a war seeks conquest. I like to think at least some military people place ethical limits on their warfare behavior.

In that vein, what I am asking is this:

* Was the A-Bomb a useful weapon? Did the war end faster because we unleashed it on Japan?

* Why was it necessary to drop TWO A-Bombs?

And most urgently:

* Did humans learn anything from the A-Bombing of Japan that military types today can or should reflect upon before firing off the nuclear weapons in their arsenals?

ill bet your dad was relieved it was over. if Truman had not dropped it and he (your dad) died then your family found he had a weapon that could have ended it, they would have wanted Truman drawn and quatered. also you wouldn't be here today !!!!

the Jap Army did not believe we had more that one weapon. also they were starving their own people to stay in the fight.

Japanese generals did not believe we had more than one A-Bomb? That seems incredible...almost suicidal. If I were Japanese, I'd be hating on those generals. Civilians should not be cannon fodder without reason.

Isn't surrender required (ethically) when civilian lives are at stake?

Yeah, we should drop the bomb on those with whom we are no longer at war. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

no they didn't. they were determined to fight to last man, woman and child if need be. surrender was not an option.

You may not have noticed this small person has joined our convo, gentlemen. He has elsewhere stated that our discussion here is without value and we are wrong for holding it.

Oh yeah. That's a real brilliant OP you have there, with your wondering why we didn't also drop the bomb on a country with whom we were no longer at war.

Just freakin' brilliant.

Good God.

Would anyone like to correct his error in thinking? I could explain about learning from history, but I don't think Si modo can take in any data from chicks.
