And yet another reason to get government out of marriage except for governmental matters of taxes, inheritance, and power of attorney for emergencies and medical decisions....

Again.. all a ploy for forced acceptance and government interference on one side.. and on the other side, not wanting to reduce government's scope

power of attorney can be handled locally. Inheritance is a right. Goverment should have diddly to do with it. Taxes should be simplified so that marriage or family relationships are null and void, a non sequitor item.

government should have nothing to do with inheritance rights? really?

damn... and to think every state has trusts and estates laws governing how estates are handled. these issues have always been dealt with by government. rights of dower, courtesy, inheritance,

you claim not to want government interference, yet you're ok with government interfering in the relationship between two people. and it's ok for government to tell me i can't purchase birth control?

i think you might want to work on consistency.

You know me Jill.... I respect the freedom for anyone to choose to be with whomever they choose in an adult relationship... and I respect the freedom for you to purchase any birth control you want..

BUT... I also respect the freedom for people to discriminate or not accept the choices of others... someone has the freedom to be an insensitive bigot just as they have the freedom to be an accepting type person.... I respect the freedom of an employer to choose what benefits they wish to pay for to their employees...

Freedom is a multi directional thing... and you have to embrace all parts of it, even if you don't like it or you don't get positive benefits from it personally
