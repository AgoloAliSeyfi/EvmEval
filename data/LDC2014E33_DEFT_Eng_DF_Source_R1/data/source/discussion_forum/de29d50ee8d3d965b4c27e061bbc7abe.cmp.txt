Dumb ass. Go argue your retarded lies somewhere else. Once again I have source documents of the JAPANESE Government and the US Government. The Japanese never offered to surrender. Further the Emperor surrendered unconditionally, WE made the choice to allow him to remain Emperor.

I still do not understand how such a HUGELY significant historical fact can be in doubt, this many years later.

CurveLight: what exactly about RetiredGySgt's documents makes them less than reliable in your view?

RetiredGySgt: why are CurveLight's documents unreliable?

Are you claiming they have been altered? They are not authentic? What?

You just CANNOT both be right on the FACTS. It's logically impossible.

He is playing with words. The Japanese made the following offer through the Soviet Union... They would cease hostilities and we would cease hostilities. They would evacuate all territory captured since Dec 7 1941 and we would evacuate all territory that was Japanese before Dec 7 1941. Further no other action would occur to Japan. No foreign presence in Japan, no reorganization of their Government, no dismantling of their military. We refused.

After the First Atomic Bomb they floated a similar plan and we again refused.

After the second Bomb the Emperor intervened in the Governments deliberations. The Army which controlled the Government absolutely REFUSED to surrender. Even after 2 Atomic Bombs. The Emperor over ruled them and ordered an immediate UNCONDITIONAL Surrender.

Curvelight is pretending that the offer to a cease of hostilities was a offer to surrender. He is further claiming that because we eventually allowed the Emperor to remain as a figure head in Japan we should not have dropped the bombs.

He is using the same intercepts as my source documents and claiming they do not clearly say what they say. Further I have in my source documents the actual meetings of the Japanese Government and what was and was not agreed to. Who wanted and did not want Peace. The Army ran the Government and was not going to surrender. Even after the Emperor agreed to surrender the Army staged a coup and tried to seize the voice recording where the Emperor ordered the surrender and prevent the Emperor from further addressing the Nation.

Well, CurveLight, what say you? If RetiredGySgt is right then the POV you and Quartermass have posted here seems less than completely intellectually honest to me.

If RetiredGySgt is correct on the FACTS, then as far as I am concerned, he is right on the ETHICS as well.

I posted that link because it has a compilation from MAGIC that tells a different story from the Trumanesque Romanticism of using the bombs.

Apologists say it was necessary to use the bombs to get Japan to surrender unconditionally. That's bullshit because even after the bombs Japan did not give an unconditional surrender. After using the bombs it was not Japan that compromised on the conditions of surrender. It was the US. Think about it.

You're quite the dumbass for ignoring what I said:

"I posted that link because it has a compilation from MAGIC that tells a different story from the Trumanesque Romanticism of using the bombs."

I don't know and don't care what else is on the site. The information for MAGIC is independently verifiable. Looks to me like you know you cannot defend your position so you seek a way out, however dishonest, rather than stand your ground.

This business of flinging URLs around isn't getting us anywhere, CurveLight. WHAT exactly is defective about the documents relied on by RetiredGySgt and namvet? Why are THEY not good evidence of what transpired?

Are the doctored?

Are they incomplete?

Is there doubt about their authenticity?
