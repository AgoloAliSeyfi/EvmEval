I talked to one of my Republican friends today, and she said her 18 year old daughter got pregnant because she didn't have enough money to pay for birth control.

And she's a REPUBLICAN.

These are real life issues that women understand better than men.

Just because you said this................of course, we all believe it!!! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>
Truth is, you (what a F'in high roller you are, too!) are just individually too cheap to pay for birth control for the women in your life.
Gawd, Chris, you are an ENTITLED one............... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>.

With everything going on in the world.
The media has spent 2 weeks on this.
And it all started at the WH when this
administration tried to get the Catholic church
to pay for birth control...

Like they had no idea the Church would respond as it did....

Paleeeeze... Give me a break.
This was designed by Axelrod and the rest running
the President's campaign.

and the Republicans walked right into the trap, didn't they?

And I said it was a trap two weeks ago, and no one on the right listened to me, did you?

I'm seriously considering making that my Avi, as it seems to be where the GOP is these days.

Here's the text of the so-called "apology" issued Saturday by the Fat Man. If this was any weaker, it would look like swiss cheese with all the holes in it. Of course, it'll appease his dittoloonies.
"For over 20 years, I have illustrated the absurd with absurdity, three hours a day, five days a week. In this instance, I chose the wrong words in my analogy of the situation. I did not mean a personal attack on Ms. Fluke.

"I think it is absolutely absurd that during these very serious political times, we are discussing personal sexual recreational activities before members of Congress. I personally do not agree that American citizens should pay for these social activities. What happened to personal responsibility and accountability? Where do we draw the line? If this is accepted as the norm, what will follow? Will we be debating if taxpayers should pay for new sneakers for all students that are interested in running to keep fit? In my monologue, I posited that it is not our business whatsoever to know what is going on in anyone's bedroom nor do I think it is a topic that should reach a Presidential level.

"My choice of words was not the best, and in the attempt to be humorous, I created a national stir. I sincerely apologize to Ms. Fluke for the insulting word choices."

Still stronger than the apologies from the dolts who saddled this nation with the pretender in the White House.....

All this faux outrage from the Left, where the Hell were you when Maher, Letterman &amp; Schultz were spewing their misogynistic bile at conservative women? Oh, that's right, you were cheering and laughing like a pack of rabid hyenas! Y'all are a bunch of hypocritical FAKES, and you've put yourselves on display in all your indignant glory.

Bunch of fucking losers, each and EVERY one of you.

And where's your supremely intelligent hero Sarah Palin these days? A REAL leader would be running for president.

"Where's Sarah?" is the adult equivalent of "Where's Waldo?".
