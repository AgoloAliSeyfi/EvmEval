I am beginning to think that imzir is either a) a troll, b) mentally deficient in someway, or c) uneducated and brainwashed. My inclination is that he is all three. This response you have posted to him has systematically demolished him, like I have many times before, and all we are ever going to get back is him quoting one or two lines of our whole argument, with a poor argument and an attack against either us or Christianity. If he believes these things and wants to have his view challenged instead of attempting to use it as a defense he is more than welcome to start his own thread on the topic, but he never does and probably never will. He is essentially using this website as a sounding board to refine his ridiculous views, and no matter how much you try and debate him with logic and facts you can never win.

When debating with imzir it is important to remember that in the Quaran there are explicit rules about when it is ok and just to lie, especially to non-believers and followers of other faiths. Indeed it even states that God himself plotted and schemed, as well as decieved, unbelievers, so why wouldn't it be ok for him to do so if it serves the needs of Islam and he has no defense?
[3:54] They plotted and schemed, but so did GOD, and GOD is the best schemer.

Bukhari 3 <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/49.gif" alt=":49:"/> 857 also states the following:
That she heard Allah's Apostle saying, &amp;quot;He who makes peace between the people by inventing good information or saying good things, is not a liar.&amp;quot;

and 9 <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/84.gif" alt=":84:"/> 64 Mohammed also states the following:
Whenever I tell you a narration from Allah's Apostle, by Allah, I would rather fall down from the sky than ascribe a false statement to him, but if I tell you something between me and you (not a Hadith) then it was indeed a trick (i.e., I may say things just to cheat my enemy). No doubt I heard Allah's Apostle saying, &amp;quot;During the last days there will appear some young foolish people who will say the best words but their faith will not go beyond their throats (i.e. they will have no faith) and will go out from (leave) their religion as an arrow goes out of the game. So, where-ever you find them, kill them, for who-ever kills them shall have reward on the Day of Resurrection.&amp;quot;

It even compels believers not to be friends with non-believers and followers of other faiths, and to always take the side of a believer over a non-Muslim:

[3:28] The believers never ally themselves with the disbelievers, instead of the believers. Whoever does this is exiled from GOD. Exempted are those who are forced to do this to avoid persecution. GOD alerts you that you shall reverence Him alone. To GOD is the ultimate destiny.
[3:29] Say, &amp;quot;Whether you conceal your innermost thought, or declare it, GOD is fully aware thereof.&amp;quot; He is fully aware of everything in the heavens and the earth. GOD is Omnipotent.

So we cannot be sure whether he is lying, whether he genuinely feels we are filthy kaffir and Islam has never stepped a foot wrong and neither have its followers, or if he is being genuine. In short: we are wasting our time debating this guy.

I don't knows imzir's motives that well however that response he gave was off the charts fallacious. In any case, some of these things you say are surprising, but then again I do not know Islam very well so I am not in much of a place to comment.

Your post is highly fallacious.

Ibn Shihaab said he did not hear that exemption was granted in anything what the people speak as lies but in three cases: in battle, for bringing reconciliation amongst persons and the narration of the words of the husband to his wife, and the narration of the words of a wife to her husband (in a twisted form in order to bring reconciliation between them). (Sahih Muslim)

imzir lying to you wouldn't be Islamically permissible. The second hadith is in relation to pseudo-muslims who were enemies, basically double agents. You're correct though, Islamic empires did engage in offensive Jihad.

The young are more easily influenced and become brainwashed into doing things. Then once they become extremist there's no turning back. It seems the older generation is more controlled and not easily led away. Also people assume the younger generation should play a major role since they are the ones who will live longer and are more active than their older counterparts. The main thing is the younger generation are too immature and don't fully understand the dangers of extremism in today's society and how it diminishes Islam's reputation as a religion of tolerance and peace.

Note: I am talking about extremists here, not your every day, moderate young Muslims

Why is it that Islamic extremists usually tend to be quite young in the UK? I mean, when you see the ones who protest with extremist placards - they usually don't seem to be any younger than 40, most of them look 18-30. The 7/7 bombers were also quite young, the Christmas day bomber, etc.

This confuses me, because one would think that the conservative older generation would be more prone to extremism and a middle-aged first-generation immigrant from Pakistan, instead of a young, third-generation immigrant born in multicultural London.

So why does it seem that younger Muslims are more prone to extremism?

Get it in their head young, easier to brainwash to prepare them for something like that
