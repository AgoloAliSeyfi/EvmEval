After reading this entire thread I want to say bravo kids you've done a credible job at maintaining a level of decency!

I think the fireworks are about to launch Crow and I have fallen into their clever trap! eep! <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

Hello John I've been over to your site and bringing your encounter here while not the easiest place in the world to navigate through the personalities is not a place where kindness in the form of humoring as a kindness is going to fill you up with empty calories. Whatever calories of knowledge you get will be the kind that will give valid energy.

I do not look for kindness here Crow. I look for ideas. I do not fear what their opinions are.

While I've never seen a Sasquatch and have grave reservations that they managed to hold on into the last quarter of the 20th century maybe they did, apparently your's did at least.

Perhaps you did see a bipedal unclassified ape munching leaves in the forest. After all if it lives it eats. The only point I have contention is the overall size of the creature. For decades I simply took at face value the size reports. Some of which you know are simply stupendously big. However I took the time recently to scale some sasquatch to various sized and when I brought up a 12 ft sasquatch next to a 5'9" man it became clear to me that anything that big would be cutting a pretty wide swath through its environment. So my only question is was it really that big? Do you think your 9 footer may have been somewhat smaller say 7'-8' which is still huge.

I saw what I saw.

No I am very sure it was well above 8 ft and probably 9 ft. I played soccer for 20 years. A soccer goal is 8 ft. It was well beyond that. I could see where its head was compared to the tree.

Also there has been issue with the amount of detail you may have seen at 50 yards. I don't have any issues at all with the details you may have seen. 50 yards is 150 ft. The driveway leading up to my studio loft is 50 yards long. From there I can easily make out details passersby in the street. 150' is not a huge distance by any means. Also you saw that animal through 17 year old eyes. At 17 my eyes were pretty sharp. I suspect that the majority of posters here are considerable older than 17 and it is unfair for shall we say middle agers 35-55yrs to discount what a pair pair of 17 year old eyes are capable of seeing at 150'.

There were details I could not see very well Crow. Such as the eyes and the fingernails. Also, It may have been less then 50 yds. It was just an estimate and I was 10 ft up in a tree, so that could make it seem farther then it was. I could see the back, shoulders, arms and hands well. My eyes were always sharp. I just started wearing glasses two years ago and I am 44.

Basically that's about all I wanted to say. I hope in the end this forum and your own research helps to sort it out for you.

Excellent discussion, even if it is about Bigfoot. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

Dude, it's been both hilarious-es, and that's a good thing. Is there some kind of award we can bestow on you when you do yet another terrific and so ******* funny job of repulsing those pesky (but) ProBigfooters? Seriously, your craftsmanship is impeccable.

The fact you still have WGBH's 'attention' is surprising, even if obvious why. I mean (and I mean it respectfully), he's still stalled on 'he saw Bigfoot'. Actually, it is true that WGBH has transformed (and possibly redeemed) himself from a literal BFF 'forum troll' to an almost famous and esteemed member of the entire Bigfoot Community, pro and con. Gotta respect that. Maybe when WGBH finally does realize there is no Bigfoot, and he will, Kitakaze will be first in line for yet another of those awards we decided in the paragraph above to regularly give him? We can only pray.
