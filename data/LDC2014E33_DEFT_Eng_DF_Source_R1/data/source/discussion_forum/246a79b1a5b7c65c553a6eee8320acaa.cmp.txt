The president's "offer" included $500 billion in new spending. That's a non-starter. No Republican is going to vote to give the president another slush fund to pay off union supporters with, especially since a portion of that money will end up in Democrat campaign coffers in the form of union dues.

Also, as always, his proposal consisted of tax increases immediately and all the cuts back loaded over a 10 year period. In other words, the "cuts" were purely imaginary.

Do you turds actually believe no one is wise to your scams?

Wow, you Republicans are really into denial. Okay here it is. Proof!

Obama:

"The Budget Control Act that I signed into law last month will cut annual Government spending by about $1 trillion over the next 10 years. It also charges the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction with finding an additional $1.5 trillion in savings. As part of this jobs bill, I am asking the Congress to increase that amount so that it covers the full cost of the American Jobs Act. In addition, I believe that the Congress should seize the opportunity that this new Committee presents and do much more so that we can put the country on a sustainable fiscal path, which is critical for our long-term economic growth and competitiveness. For this reason, I am sending to the Congress this detailed plan to pay for this jobs bill and realize more than $3 trillion in net deficit reduction over the next 10 years. Combined with the approximately $1 trillion in savings from the first part of the Budget Control Act, this would generate more than $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade. This would bring the Nation to the point where current spending is no longer adding to our debt and where our debt is no longer increasing as a share of our economy--an important milestone on the way to restoring fiscal discipline and moving us toward balance." [Living Within Our Means and Investing in the Future: The President's Plan for Economic Growth and Deficit Reduction, WhiteHouse.gov, September 2011]

There you go. Can't argue with facts. However, it should be noted that many democrats didn't support the bill either. I never said democrats shouldn't be to blame for impeding Obama. Contrary to what Fox News will tell you, Obama is on the center of the political spectrum. He has been criticized by Democrats for being too diplomatic.

In other words, don't blame Obama. Blame ALL of congress.

Exactly. I can't believe that any wingnuts would have the balls to bring up anything to do with "putting troops in harms way" after their support of the Iraq invasion and occupation.

I have and do support going into Afghanistan after Bin Laden however and so did Bush at first. But then later he said "I don't know where bin Laden is. I have no idea and really don't care. It's not that important. It's not our priority."

...still tore up the deal. Why? Because it included taxing the wealthy. It's absolutely ridiculous. Fox News/Republicans are always touting that taxing the wealthy wouldn't make a big dent in the deficit, which is true. However, just because it's a small dent, it doesn't mean that it shouldn't be included in the proposal. The tax hikes on the rich that Obama proposed would have reduced the deficit by 300 billion dollars. As small as that amount is toward reducing the deficit, isn't it a good compromise on the issue of taxes considering that the proposal totalled 4 trillion all together in cuts?

Can the rich really not handle being slightly less rich than they could be for the sake of getting the country back on track?

Now, all we have to show for it is 1.2 trillion in automatic cuts.

Getting the country on track would be removing obama from office. That is all.
