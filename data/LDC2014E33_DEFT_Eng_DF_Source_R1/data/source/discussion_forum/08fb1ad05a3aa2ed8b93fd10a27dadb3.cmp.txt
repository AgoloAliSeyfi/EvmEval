Ditto Thomas - My basic premise is that minimum wage (in most cases) will not have an impact - other than the possibility of people being laid off. I simply cannot write as eloquently as Thomas.

Yes, price is affected by increased costs, indirectly. It has an affect on supply. If costs go up there is a shift of the supply curve resulting in higher prices.

I suggested the basic economics in it seemed some people didn't understand the basic cost/supply relationship - and many people in their thoughtful wish to help others less fortunate only correlate higher salary = more spending power without looking at the downstream impacts (or lack thereof). If it sounded like an insult or talking down to anyone I apologize it was meant more as if you haven't a background in the subject how could you realize all the impacts. Similar to I would never understand ramifications to certain medical procedures.

Realjohnboy - disposable income will increase for those individuals receiving the increase in salary, but for those that get laid off it won't - so net someone gets $0 and some one else receives double. That nets the same. Sam gets an increase to $200, Fred gets $0 being laid off so disposable income prior to rise in minimum wage is $200 and after $200.

From one of my favorite dictionaries:

Causes of Inflation
Economists wake up in the morning hoping for a chance to debate the causes of inflation. There is no one cause that's universally agreed upon, but at least two theories are generally accepted:

Demand-Pull Inflation - This theory can be summarized as "too much money chasing too few goods". In other words, if demand is growing faster than supply, prices will increase. This usually occurs in growing economies.

Cost-Push Inflation - When companies' costs go up, they need to increase prices to maintain their profit margins. Increased costs can include things such as wages, taxes, or increased costs of imports.

Linkat, Individual companies don't have total control on increasing prices, because of competition. Yes, there are many variables that affect prices, and trying to explain it through one company is not realistic.

Of course individuals companies do not - I was using this as an example to simply things - just increase this to include the apple industry as a whole as the minimum wage would affect all those businesses.

Just a head's up. The teaser on National Public Radio mentioning that tomorrow (Wed) during Morning Edition there will be a story on The Minimum Wage. That is all I know.

I heard that, too. Also mentioned that the Bush administration is not in favor of raising minimum wage.

Meanwhile... <a href="http://nationaljournal.com/about/njweekly/stories/2006/0711nj1.htm">I don't guess $16,000 annual raises harm the economy.</a>

Without looking it up...would anyone care to guess at how many jobs out there actually pay minimum wage.

I had to look it up:

According to numerous sources, approximately 30 million workers between the ages of 18 and 64 earn less than $9 an hour in their jobs -- a full-time annual income of $18,800, assuming a full-time (40 hour week), 52-week work schedule -- the income that marks the federal poverty line for a family of four. These are folks making somewhere around the minimum wage ($5.15 an hour for nontipped workers, and $2.13 an hour for tipped workers).

Am I confusing my numbers, or is that about ten percent of the population?

<post author="cicerone imposter" datetime="2006-07-11T19:19:00" id="p132">
That's about ten percent of the US population, but much greater when looking at 'working age' people - say people age 18 or over. Some seniors also work beyond "retirement" age.
