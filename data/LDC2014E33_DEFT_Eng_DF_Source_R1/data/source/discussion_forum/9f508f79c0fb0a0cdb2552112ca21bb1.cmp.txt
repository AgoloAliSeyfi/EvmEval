COOFFFEEEEEE!!!! I NEED COOOFFEEEEEEEEE!
Omg, I'm tired. Following last week's fiasco of sick kid and cat, I spent most of the weekend working and finally sent out my document that was due a month ago last night at midnight. It felt so amazing.
Then DH tried to have sex with me, but I wantd to sleep. Just as I was falling asleep, Puce (dumb cute cat) jumped on me and started rubbing her ass in my face. Then the baby woke up. I went bac to bed at 1:30. Would have been better off having sex.
Do your kids ruin your sex life? We wanted to get some saturday night, but they both woke up one after the other and ruined it. Then yesterday afternoon, we were getting ready to run to the basement when Anna said she wasn't sleepy. I sent her back to the couch to rest and she fell asleep after about 15 minutes, but then Sophia woke up from her nap.
Lesson learned. From now on we shall walk around naked and get at it as soon as we get 2 minutes free.

YES. Saturday night H went up to bed first. I was finishing a book. When I wandered up at 11:30 to go to bed and hopefully get some, I was thwarted by a six-year-old who was already in my bed.

I can't imagine trying to get some with two kids. I find it hard enough with one. I swear I hear him crying even when he is sound asleep.

Definitely ruins the sex life. Sometimes we used to meet in our walk in closet for a quickie.

luvvy, you get more creative, lol. I don't think we've done it in our bed in ages, it is usually the living room couch, the bathroom, basement, etc. We figure Anna runs straight to our room when she wakes up, so that is not where we want to be, lol.
We got a quicky in thursday night (yw) but I need something a bit more satisfying. I told DH we need to take a day off work for a sex marathon.

We are morning sexers and it is getting pretty pathetic that we have to wake up at 6 am to properly screw on a Saturday morning. And of course we lock the door and there is always the chance we will hear the little knock on the door and we frantically yell "Go play with the ipad." lol
Yeah total drag.

About the only time that works for us consistently is Saturday mornings -- after DH gets up with the girls and lets me sleep in!
They're pretty good at playing while DH and I take a shower together -- or in the case of this past Saturday, lock our bedroom door and try to ignore the little knocks and giggles when we tell them to go away.
