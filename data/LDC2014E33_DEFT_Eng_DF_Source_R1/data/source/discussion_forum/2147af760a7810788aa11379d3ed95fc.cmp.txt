In reference to Gelisgesti's posted article:

As I have stated before, either the U.S. gets in this game or others will and then hold the technology and subsequent patents. As Health consumers we can pay now by investing in the future or pay much more at a later date to other countries for the use of their technologies. Since the U.S.'s major economic edge is in technological innovation and less, nowadays, in manufacturing, the later course is not a wise one.

However, there are some bright lights that continue to shine through the medieval efforts of the religious right--these only further encouraged by politicians' short sighted attempts to pander to this block of voters for the sake of political expediency. Some states, such as California and New Jersey, have set aside funds for research in this area. Additionally, it is interesting, if not just anecdotal, to see people, such as the Reagans, come out in favor of this research once their life experience provides a view through a somewhat different lense.

I have every belief that the tide will turn on this issue. Sooner or later government sponsored research will allow more of the U.S.'s best minds to join the effort. The question lies in who will lead and develop this technology and who will have to go hat in hand and beg to pay for its benefits when it comes of age. The irrational indictment of those researchers as killers is the same as that which places such monikers upon researchers who use animals to advance medical science. It touches the hearts of the uninformed, caring, and squeamish, but seems to deny the obvious benefits afforded to all humans.

Respectfully,

JM
