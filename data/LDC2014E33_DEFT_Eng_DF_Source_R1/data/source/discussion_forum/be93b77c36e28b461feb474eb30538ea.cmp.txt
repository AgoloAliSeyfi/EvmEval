Shirley Sherrod, we now know that her video was edited, yet it was played on Fox again and again. And when poor Shirley was forced to resign, Fox comes out with a report, just tonight, that Obama threw an "innocent" woman under the bus. Now, Fox says she's innocent. Only now.

Then there's James OKeefe and Acorn. A single Republican, able to bring down an organization that helped the poor, from spliced together video tapes. Well, he is getting sued. But, "he did it". Now all those poor people are a little more poor.

Then there were Republican leaders privately telling Obama that they would work with him and then publicly, saying they would do everything they could to bring him down (they called it "Waterloo"). And they did. And poor Obama believed them time and time again. I wonder if he believes them now?

There was Iraq. That was because of WMDs, no, because of yellow-cake, no, it was to bring "freedom", no, it was.....

There was the 2.4 trillion dollar tax cut. Supposed to bring jobs. And it did. It brought them to China and India and even Mexico.

Then there was April 16th 2008, Healthcare Decisions Day, proclaimed by the former Gov. of Alaska, Sarah Palin. In fact, it was such a good idea, that Democrats used the SAME legislation in the Health Care Bill. Only Sarah stopped calling it, "Healthcare Decisions Day", no, instead she called it "death panels" and "kill grandma". Another fast one.

And this unemployment bill? Stripped of everything that would help the economy. Now Republicans say, "Where's the roads being built? Where's the dam's being restored? Where's the bridges being fixed?" Well, they should know. They forced Democrats into removing them from any legislation.

Imagine if Republicans put all the sneakiness into helping the middle class. Into actually rebuilding the country. Into being on the side of regular Americans. Yea, imagine that.

Since we've established that Fox didn't play the editted clip until the OReilly Factor at 8pm and the administration demanded her resignation before 5pm, can we expect you to correct false accusation against Fox News about playing the clip again and again?

Nope.
I don't expect it.

I expect to hear a string of fresh bullshit about FOX's previous instances of biased reporting.

So how DID the edited video (of 24 years ago) get to go viral? I seriously doubt millions of people read Andrew Breibart's blog.

<a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/12/22/james-okeefe-accused-of-sexual-harassment/">Busted</a> !!!!!!

" Conservative blogger Nadia Naffe accused OKeefe of sending her harassing messages after she backed out of an upcoming hidden camera sting on the  Occupy Wall Street  protest in New York City. Judge Alan Karch dismissed the criminal complaint against OKeefe because there was insufficient evidence showing the harassment originated in Westwood, where OKeefe lives with his parents.

Naffe also vaguely suggested that OKeefe drugged her, and that she passed out while OKeefe and a friend were taking her to the train station. When she awoke, she allegedly found underwear and a wireless mouse had been stolen from her luggage, according to Harris report about the hearing."
