<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/02/09/girl-of-10-imprisoned-and-repeatedly-raped_n_1265485.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012...n_1265485.html</a>

So a 10 year old deaf girl was brought into the UK in 2000 where she was treated basically as a slave and was repeatedly physically and sexually abused during her enslavement.

So many things wrong with this case, even putting aside the question of how our border agency somehow failed to stop a 10 year old deaf girl from Pakistan who didn't speak a word of English entering the country, they taught her to sign her own name so she could claim benefits.

So a girl, who they have no record of started claiming benefits, said girl was deaf and unable to speak, she didn't have any form of communication other than possibly visual (no evidence of that) with whatever benefit officials were in charge of her case and said benefit officials never bothered to check if she was actually being cared for?

How can this not set of some kind of alarm? I'm going to be honest i have very little knowledge of how the benefit system works in this country but presumably to claim job seekers/disability allowance/ incapacity allowance someone needs to have some form of direct contact with you? If you claim carers allowance for someone then an official must check you are actually caring for the person?

Could someone please set me straight and tell me that they must have manipulated the benefit system in a massive way by tricking whoever they sent to check on the girl and our government didn't just hand over tax payers money without any confirmation the girl was even being looked after and effectively helped to fund slavery?

Instead the girl was made to cook, clean, do the washing and ironing for the Ashars and clean the houses and cars of their family and friends, the court heard.

And none of these people ever suspected that the girl was being abused? How the hell was this allowed to happen for over 10 years?

Update: Girl did have contact with officials when she arrived in the UK and could not understand them. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-17029654">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england...ester-17029654</a>

She didnt have anyone assigned to check up on her (social worker). Simple. If she cant communicate then her familywould be free to do what they wanted with her without getting found out. Tbh I'm more surprised that they got caught.

Horrible but don't worry guys Labour promised they would protect the borders! Surely they wouldn't try to deliberately hoodwink the British public again?

The idea thing makes me feel sick, and I find people's reactions to this horrible. It's sick how many people read stories like this and then make a joke in order to get rep. A little deaf girl was a slave to a family for 10 years; it's not funny.

Even by TSR's standards I'm surprised by the amount of people who have the nerve to laugh about this.

That poor girl's life has been totally ruined by some sick and selfish people.

OP failed to mention that she may have been raped aswell for those 10 yrs.

I was told that humans are very caring and that unlike animals we can tell by facial expression how the other person is feeling so to imagine for 10 yrs that they could do this without giving a s*** and even feeling a bit of guilt/remorse is very very upsetting sometimes i have to convince myself us humans are caring and intelligent but tbh i cant see a difference between us and animals.

I am suprised we all havent wiped each other out by now.

This is so awful, that poor girl, and this has been happening for 10 years?

They've stolen her childhood from her.

I hope that she's somewhere safe now with people to care for her, and I hope she is taught sign language, it would be awful for her not to be able to communicate with anyone.

You seem more bothered that the family cheated the benefit system than the actual well being of the girl. Human rights should always come before money.
