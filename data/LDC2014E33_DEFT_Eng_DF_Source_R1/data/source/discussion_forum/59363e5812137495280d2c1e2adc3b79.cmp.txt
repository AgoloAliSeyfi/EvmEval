Former Home Secretary Charles Clarke has accused Gordon Brown of "absolutely stupid" behaviour during the furore over Tony Blair's leadership.

Well, that was a short-lived truce...

A short-lived truce indeed:

<a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,1868488,00.html">Brown to PM: time to back me</a>

meets

<a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,1869171,00.html">Blair to Brown: I won't do what you demand</a>

------------------------------

Worse than that; the Blairite camp is letting it be known, via the usual anonymous sources, that what Labour really needs now is to make the upcoming leadership question and contest "a referendum on Brown's integrity".. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes"/>

(Irony points meanwhile, after 9 years of minutely orchestrated Blair politics, for Charles Clarke attacking Brown for his "control freak instincts".)

Sunday September 10, 2006
The Observer

Gordon Brown's long-held dream of taking over as Prime Minister received a significant blow this weekend after it was revealed that up to 10 cabinet ministers are discussing backing an 'anyone but Gordon' candidate and that Tony Blair will not give the Chancellor a personal endorsement.

Senior government figures are threatening to make the contest a bitter referendum on Brown's personal integrity after last week's vicious bout of infighting. They spent Friday discussing their choice of candidate and the mechanics of a bid after concluding they could no longer support him.

This follows a serious breakdown between the two rival camps, culminating, according to one very close confidant of Tony Blair, in the Prime Minister telling friends: 'I have never known how mendacious he [Gordon] was, how full of mendacity.'

Cabinet ministers spoke to The Observer before Blair's warning yesterday to both sides to suspend their damaging personal attacks [..]. The Prime Minister also condemned the 'irredeemably old-fashioned' politics of MPs plotting against him and called for openness in debating Labour's future. This was seen as a signal that discussion will not be repressed by what Charles Clarke called Brown's 'control freak' instincts. [..]

The cabinet source said while they had not chosen a rival candidate yet, the last week had tipped the balance to someone of 'credibility and stature' standing against Brown. Alan Johnson, Alan Milburn, John Reid and Charles Clarke are potential names.

'Until the beginning of this week, most of us would have ended up supporting him [Brown] because there wasn't anyone else,' said a source involved in the discussions. 'Now almost for sure, because of his behaviour, there will be a serious challenge from someone within cabinet and he's only got himself to blame.'

Asked how many of the cabinet would back such a candidate, the minister said: 'Now, I think half a dozen, but I think it could be more like 10 [when a candidate is picked]. This week has been the cathartic moment. It's not about policy: the question is who has the character, the personal qualities. Gordon is his own worst enemy.' Brown's behaviour showed he lacked the 'honesty, integrity and trustworthiness' required, the source added. [..]

The Prime Minister is not now expected to publicly bless Brown's candidacy, and a senior minister said even a repeat of previous glowing testimonials were now out: 'He will describe him as having made an immense contribution, because he has, but I'm afraid that events of this week have changed things fundamentally and for ever. [..]

Brown's allies will, however, be reassured by an Ipsos/MORI poll for The Observer which found voters rated him more trustworthy, having better judgment and as more down-to-earth than most politicians, including Blair.

[And] Brown [..] suggested that his critics were motivated by old disputes. He added that any Chancellor 'is in the difficult position of having to tell his colleagues "no" '. [..]

If there are further public attacks on Brown, [moreover,] a delegation of Labour MPs is said to be prepared to go to Downing Street this week to demand that Blair quit. Downing Street sources stressed Blair had phoned ministers and friends yesterday to demand self-restraint.

Ha! I only just now realised the juxtaposition between this thread and my signature.

Nothing to do with each other though - the sig is from a Waterboys song (yes, really) :wink:
