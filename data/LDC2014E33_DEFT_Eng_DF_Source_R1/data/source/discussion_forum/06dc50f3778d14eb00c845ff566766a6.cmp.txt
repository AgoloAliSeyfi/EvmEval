Here's the text of the so-called "apology" issued Saturday by the Fat Man. If this was any weaker, it would look like swiss cheese with all the holes in it. Of course, it'll appease his dittoloonies.
"For over 20 years, I have illustrated the absurd with absurdity, three hours a day, five days a week. In this instance, I chose the wrong words in my analogy of the situation. I did not mean a personal attack on Ms. Fluke.

"I think it is absolutely absurd that during these very serious political times, we are discussing personal sexual recreational activities before members of Congress. I personally do not agree that American citizens should pay for these social activities. What happened to personal responsibility and accountability? Where do we draw the line? If this is accepted as the norm, what will follow? Will we be debating if taxpayers should pay for new sneakers for all students that are interested in running to keep fit? In my monologue, I posited that it is not our business whatsoever to know what is going on in anyone's bedroom nor do I think it is a topic that should reach a Presidential level.

"My choice of words was not the best, and in the attempt to be humorous, I created a national stir. I sincerely apologize to Ms. Fluke for the insulting word choices."

Like I said, he will never apologize. This proves my point.

</quote>

No. It proves you were wrong.

Your post proves you lack honesty.

Did you actually read the "apology" or did you just spew that robotically?

Anybody seen apologies for names given to Governor Palin?

Just curious. The high and mighty seem to be going overboard on this. How about names given to Governor Palin's children?

Trig rings a bell.

It was Sarah Palin who called Trig retarded, according to Levi Johnston. Maybe you should talk to Palin.

Wonkettes and Andrew Sullivan pushed it to the max. Levi well, what can I say?

I know the drill. I know what they did. Nothing short of evil that anyone could be proud of.
Cruel and mean. And not necessary at all.

Poor baby wasn't running for public office.

The amount of posts on this thread in such a short amount of time shows one thing for sure. That is Rush Limbaugh stirs the passions on both sides of the isle, which is why he's so successful. Like it or not he is "doing what he was born to do" <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Sandra Fluke is not the first women to kick the shit out of Rush, Hillary did it first.

While her husband was getting a blow job in the Oval Office. And she and her daughter were upstairs.

An intern was on her knees sucking him off.

Lets talk truth.
