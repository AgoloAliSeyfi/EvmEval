The Catholic Church is opposed to contraception for moral reasons.

Where is the morality in creating a life when food and clean water are rare commodities? Where poverty exists and educational opportunities are non existent?

Where is the morality when disease is spread?

Where is the morality when a women is the victim of domestic violence? When a women is forced to conceive and then trapped as the child become a lever to gain more power and more control?

when you force women to have children they may not want, in many cases they become dependent on the state for services such as medicaid, food stamp, welfare, the foster system, etc etc.

So, in your opinion, a church which engages in animal sacrifice or practices polyandry/polygamy should be beyond the reach of law?

There is a difference between disallowing a behavior and forcing someone into a behavior.

Personally, I'm a fan of contraception.

As far as your questions about the morality of other issues, I would bet the Church also views those as important.

However, when it comes to the soul and the physical being, in the Church's eyes, the soul trumps the former. And, they have always wanted more souls to watch over. Fill that basket, you know.

Not my view, either. But, I'm not the Church.

And, I have no interest in telling the Church what to do (as if they'd listen anyway); I just cast my 'vote' concerning the Church with my feet. But, as I am a big fan of the Constitution, I sure as hell don't want my government telling the Church or any other religious organization what is kosher to believe and what isn't.

If the Church believes that the soul is more important than the physical being, that is their prerogative.

(I won't be joining them or 'going back' anytime soon, though.)

Actually, I'm a fan of the First Amendment and agree with the SCOTUS on what few limitations we place on it.

That's not responsive to the question. And to suggest that members of the Supreme Court are always wise and just disregards history.

Are you trying to suggest all conservatives are religious? If so you should rethink that angle.

I can tell everyone that many years ago contraception was an issue for our family. We couldnt afford it. The result was a beautiful Baby Boy. The little cuss is now 6'1" Married has is own house and works for Boeing. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

So the church is disabllowing its members from using birth control, the punishment for doing so will be the loss of entry into heaven. How is that different than forcing a behavior?

Hold on. What country are you talking about? Food and water are scarce? Educational opportunity is non-existant? I know you're not talking about America. If you talking about another country than that's the country's problem, not the church's.

The Catholic are against contraceptives because they want as many members as they can get. It has nothing to do with morals.

Why is it literally 100% impossible for the liberal mind to understand that just because you don't want government involved in something doesn't mean you're against it?

I'm in favor of feeding, clothing, and giving shelter to the poor. I'm against all the gov't institutions that tax our brains out and who inefficiently attempt to provide some of these things.

Now am I just a genius who doesn't know it, or is it really not THAT hard to understand such a simple concept?
