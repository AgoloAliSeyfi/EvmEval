Absolutely incorrect. Decisions of the most horrific choices are caused by tyrannical governments and leaders that force men and women of good will to make such choices.

Please, naivete informs your statement. Please think very carefully before uttering such statements.

You're full of shit and I've proven several times the bombs were not necessary but you keep on wrapping your ignorance up in a form of patriotism indistinguishable from butt monkey crack.

You have not proven anything. Once again, you claimed the Japanese made numerous attempts to surrender before the bombs were dropped. A LIE.

You claimed that Japan made an offer EXACTLY like what was given them after the bombs. A LIE.

You claimed that Japan was offered a conditional surrender. Again a LIE.

MEANWHILE, I provided PROOF Japan made ONE attempt to end the war before the bombs were dropped and that was no surrender offer.

I provided proof that even after both bombs were dropped and the Soviets declared war the Japanese Government REFUSED to surrender. It took the DIRECT intervention of the Emperor and that was nearly foiled by an attempted Coup by the Army.

Try again you coward.
