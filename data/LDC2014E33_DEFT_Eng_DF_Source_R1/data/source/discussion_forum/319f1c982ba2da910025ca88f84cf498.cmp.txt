Did you type that with a straight face? He is the very embodiment of the social Darwinism of the right. He personifies the "greed is good" catechism that was put on steroids during Reagan's time in office, and is the very TRUEST standard bearer of Reagan's legacy.

Granted, he has a habit of being a bit more abrupt, or forthright about his "screw them" attitude, as his disconnect from ordinary Americans is way more loud and proud than it was back in the day, but the overall intent is totally on target.

You all can rest assured that you, too will be fucked over in a Romney administration the same way Reagan fucked you or your parents.

By 'greed is good', I take it you mean he's a successful, self made multi-millionaire with a great head for business.... Yea, God forbid we elect one of those to run this country... much better to elect idiot after idiot.

Yes, someone who DID work their way up from humble beginnings to become a big success WOULD be a good candidate for President.

How much money did Romney's dad leave him in his inheritance ?
How much money did Obama's dad leave him in HIS inheritance.

Funny how you equate success with being born rich and staying that way.
Only CONZ could think that being born on third means they hit a triple.

Romney is not conservative. He is Republican, through and through, which makes him much closer to Bush and Obama than to being a conservative.

He is neither fiscally nor socially conservative despite the rhetoric he is employing to get him the nomination and a shot at the Presidency.

Unfortunately, there is too much of this "Anybody but..." mentality.

If only we had someone that cared about this nation, liberal or conservative, who would run. If we did, we might actually survive as a nation. It is not the philosoply that is our problem. It is the person behind the philosophy.

itll take a true 3rd party nominee (i.e. Ross Perot) to truly change the conversation.

Unfortunately that also takes money and backing from the rich and powerful. Right now, they are doing very well with the two parties they have. They are not going to cut their noses off to spite their faces.
