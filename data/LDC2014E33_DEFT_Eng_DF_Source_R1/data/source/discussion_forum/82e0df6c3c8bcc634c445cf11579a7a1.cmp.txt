So the consensus seems to be that it is okay for a mob to dictate what roads we can and cannot go down? Interesting but I don't agree with that.

Wow! I mean... Wow! Possibly the dumbest assumption on this subject I have seen, and there have been so many. Believe me, the students don't need to be made to look bad - their behaviour is doing that already.

My one piece of advice to anyone interested in the discussion on University fees is... READ THE FACTS FIRST. The vast majority of students seem to be getting their information from idiot friends, Facebook postings, Labour party propaganda or just plain making it up. Here is my top 10 important FACTS you should all be aware of:
The £9000 figure being quoted is the MAXIMUM that a University will be able to charge per year. Obviously they can charge a lot less if they want/can. Previously the maximum fee was £3290 but then they had lots of government (i.e. tax payer) subsidy then. If Universities charge £6000 or more they need to abide by strict access agreements with the 'Office for Fair Access' to allow lower income students to attend. If they don't stick to the agreements then OFFA can fine them up to £500,000. For low income students there is the newly set up £150m National Scholarship Programme which will pay for the first year of their course. If Universities charge £6000 or more for a course then any student who would have been eligible for free school meals (if they were at school) would have their second year tuition fees paid for by the University. This can actually mean that for a three year course they only pay for one year! Maintenance grants for households earning less than £25,000 raises from £2906 to £3250 a year. Households earning up to £42,000 can still get a partial grant. The reason for the increase to the cap is because the Universities will get less money in subsidies and have to be more independent. If the fees aren't increased then the Uni's will have to provide either less courses or lower the quality of courses which is not good for anyone and would make UK qualifications less valuable in the world job market. Plus, foreign students who pay the FULL fees (much more than UK students) will go elsewhere for more valuable qualifications meaning even less money for UK Uni's. The students will not have to pay back these student loans until they earn £21,000 a year or more (increased from £15,000 previously). Even if the students earn £21,000 these are INTEREST FREE loans. If they earn more then they will have to pay a small amount of interest up to 3% (plus inflation) for incomes of £41,000 a year or more. If they have not cleared the debt 30 years after graduating then the loan is wiped clean. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says that only about 10% of graduates will end up paying back more than they borrowed. The rest will pay back either what they owed (interest free) or less because they reach the 30 year cut off. Suddenly it doesn't seem quite so bad.

Agree with everything above, but try telling that to the sh*t for brain idiots who believe everything they come across they are entitled to, and whenever they want it.

They have nothing to do with the fees increasing. How would you like it if someone hit you for no reason...?

There wasn't a single part of my post that implied they were responsible for the fees increasing.

They didn't get hit, they got a smashed window and paint on their car.

This is so true, attacking a car is just over the top!!

If you're going to quote me, I'd appreciate it if you didn't alter what I say to suit you. Or at least make it more clear where the alterations begin, and where my actual comments end.

In any case, I assume that you would be angry if a group of people surrounded your car and smashed the windows while shouting threats. I might suggest that you would think it was, "just over the top."
