I never put words in your mouth. Of course you wouldn't state you excused it, because you really try very hard to avoid saying anything substantial. But you bluster, and cry, and whine about Obama &amp; Sykes, day after day after day, and can't even bring yourself to criticize Coulter. Yeah, thats excusing it. If you can't see that, you need to repeat the 2nd grade. Again.

Your one to talk. Funny, I didn't notice you calling out Coulter either, despite you telling everyone to get AIDS and die at some lame attempt at bashing Sykes.

Aww, you posted a video of your wife. How cute. And "my guy" doesn't need to get off the hook, since theres no hook he is on. I'm pointing out the fake outrage on the right. You cry and whine and moan when its a lefty doing the insulting, but when its the right doing it, well its just entertainment.

Wow, I knew you all goose stepped together, but I didn't know you'd presume to speak for their opinions. A level of echo chamber blindness which is truly frightening.
