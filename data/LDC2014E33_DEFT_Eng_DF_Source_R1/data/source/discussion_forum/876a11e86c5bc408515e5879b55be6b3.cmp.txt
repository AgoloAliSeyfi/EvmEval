So Madeline, do you drive a car? Use rubbermaid products? Brush your hair?

Good luck with your boycott! And don't ride the bus if you decide to stop driving.

Yes I do Luissa, though I dun think I own anything made by Rubbermaid. I am sure BP is a conglomerate and supplier to many companies. Boycotting is never perfect, Luissa...do you have a better idea?

Siting passively by whilst manatees and sea turtles become extinct in the next month does not appeal to me, but I am more interested in being effective than I am in being right.

What ought we do then miss, in your opinion?

Thats the first step in every evil deed.... you stop thinking about whether or not your cause is right, and then whatever you want to do you can justify in your mind...

I don't know how to go about seeking vengence on BP for desecration of the Gulf. I am beside myself. My best friend #3 was going to St. George Island with her family for Mother's Day this weekend. But they will probably cancel because the oil slick will have reached those sugary sand beaches by then.

About a month after the ocean's shores have been befouled, the inland waterways will begin showing the devasation. The Wakulla River, where my kidlet taught me to canoe. The St. John's River, where we hung out in a biker bar in St. Mark's on Fridays after work, eating broiled shrimp and drinking cheap beer, just watching the Earth do it's thing.

Eventually the oil will travel the underground and above-ground aquifer to every Florida body of water, including the beleagered Everglades...a natural phenomena unparrelled on Planet Earth and precious not only to Florida, but to the entire Planet for the role it plays in our wildlife, ecosystem and so on.

Death would not be too severe a punishment for BP's CEO, as I see it.

Don't buy BP gasoline!

Try to boycott, especially if you are purchasing large quantities for a commercial trucking, farming or airline business.

I welcome any additional ideas on how to afflict BP.

I am just heart broken. I cannot tell you what this preventable insult to the Earth will be like for all of Florida, and beyond.

Vengeance? Isn't that the kind of thing a liberal should be against? Vengeance brings more vengeance remember?

Funny how those oh so self-righteous liberal sensibilities go out the window when its convenient... Well if its vengeance you seek, take it out on your lifestyle.. After all if you follow the trail back to its source, and get to the core of the entire evil you will find consumerism and modern lifestyles the prime culprit...

If there wasn't an ever increasing need for oil, we wouldn't be drilling there. If there really was a viable alternative oil wouldn't be an issue.

BP nor the owners of the rig wanted a disaster like this, it hurts them publicly, in a very hard and very hard to get past way. not to mention the sheer costs and legalities to follow. Also loss of property, loss of revenue from the oil, and various other things. They did not take shortcuts or skirt any regulations in place, they were just inspected recently and passed.

This was an accident. A very tragic and unfortunate accident and nothing more. They will pay for the clean-up and damages, in fact who do you think will be the main employer of those doing the cleaning? BP will of course just as EXXON did before.

Vengeance? Really? Then look to your car, your house, your boat, your electricity, your medicine, your consumables, your food, your water, and even your very existence.

Perhaps. I think it will take time to analyse what exactly went wrong on the rig...but it really does not matter, legally. The BP Corp. is Strictly Liable for the spill and all its consequences.

I am not a "Greenie". I can throw a plastic container into the trash without weeping. But I protested against the Alaskan Oil Pipeline, I have agitated for/against EPA activities, and I do care about the State of Florida because I lived and loved there.

How innocent of bio-impact must I be before I am ethically able to condemn BP?

And where on Earth did you ever get the idea that all Liberals are sweetie-pies who cannot get angry? Miss the 1960's entirely did ya?
