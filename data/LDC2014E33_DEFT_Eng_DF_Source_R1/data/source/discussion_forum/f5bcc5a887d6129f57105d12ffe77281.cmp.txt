After reading and watching news reports about Anders Behring Breivik, the Norwegian killings, his document calling for a "Christian war to defend Europe against what he described as a Muslim domination" and a recent report of the most atheist countries in the world I have come to a conclusion that it might be possible for peace to ensue if the majority of population were to become atheists.

People go to war for many things but a surely a level of peace could be attained if one day people would stop fighting over religious differences. The most common religious war has to be between the Christians and the Muslims Hindus, Jews and Sikhs are fighting each other to an extent.

It's naive to think this could ever happen but anything's possible. What are your thoughts?

He (Breivik) states:

I’m not going to pretend I’m a very religious person as that would be a lie. I’ve always been very pragmatic and influenced by my secular surroundings and environment.

Perhaps this is true for many cases. Religion is a crutch for many weak people and many embrace religion for self serving reasons as a source for drawing mental strength (to feed their weak emotional state f example during illness, death, poverty etc.). Since I am not a hypocrite, I’ll say directly that this is my agenda as well. However, I have not yet felt the need to ask God for strength, yet... But I’m pretty sure I will pray to God as I’m rushing through my city, guns blazing, with 100 armed system protectors pursuing me with the intention to stop and/or kill. I know there is a 80%+ chance I am going to die during the operation as I have no intention to surrender to them until I have completed all three primary objectives AND the bonus mission. When I initiate (providing I haven’t been apprehended before then), there is a 70% chance that I will complete the first objective, 40% for the second, 20% for the third and less than 5% chance that I will be able to complete the bonus mission. It is likely that I will pray to God for strength at one point during that operation, as I think most people in that situation would.

If praying will act as an additional mental boost/soothing it is the pragmatical thing to do.

He was far from a Christian fundamentalist. He seems more like a agnostic/cultural Christian (he even states you don't have to be religiously Christian, just culturally to join his group) whose taking the advantage of faith.

I agree with you completely, and Norway is indeed a very good example.

Norway is an atheistic nation to a very large extent, and we see that the vast majority of their violent crime statistics relate to "non-western" offenders, which is news-channel code for 'immigrant Muslims'. And now their most horrific terrorist attack/act of ideological violence for decades comes from a Christian Crusader, with their previous troubles from far-right religious groups being black metal satanists burning churches.

Where religion rears its head, we see violence, and where there is an absence of it (i.e. with the rest of the Norwegian population) we see peace, we see consensus, we see unity, we see education, we see moral, intellectual and technological progress.

And this evidence isn't just in Norway, it's in similar countries like Sweden, the Netherlands, etc. And you can gain even more evidence from countries which are both atheistic and extremely religious in equal measure. The US, for example. Although this may be controversial, but republican conservatism is strongly linked with high doses of Christianity, and liberalism linked with atheism... and what do we see when we compare the violent crime statistics of 'blue' states versus 'red' states? Well, the red states have for more murder, rape, violent assault, etc, than the blue states.

Conservatism and religion are, in my opinion, are the two heaviest balls, chained to our civilisation, and restraining our progress.

so nobody has any reason to engage in warfare beyond religion? it's true that violence declines with religion but the world without religion is not a utopia nor anything close to that...

Nah. Education, women's rights and economic development are more likely to bring about global peace. Atheism is important in challenging religious authority, especially in education where religion holds a lot of influence in many developing countries education systems, and in promoting women's rights in the face of patriarchal religious dogma, but it's not a panacea.

Then why are the most atheistic countries in the western world (i.e. also clear of conservatism and communism) almost entirely free from such violent internal conflict?

see for you to have made your point in your favour, you also had to exclude other factors.

I highly doubt it, religion isn't the only reason that people fight.

Atheists would still commit crimes, just not in the name of religion.
