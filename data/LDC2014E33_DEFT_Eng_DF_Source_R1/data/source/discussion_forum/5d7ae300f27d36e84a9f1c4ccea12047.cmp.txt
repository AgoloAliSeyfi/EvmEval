Fair is subjective... no matter how you look at it... someone or some group wil always claim unfair because it goes against their personal comfort or feelings or whatever...

What this country SHOULD be concerned with is equal treatment by government under law... not treating dollar X differently for person Y than how dollar A is being treated for person B...

A sales tax is equal... not bothered by personal situations.... not influenced by this voting group in particular... it is blind, and it is equal in treatment for every person and for every dollar spent... a similar system should be in place for dollars earned... with zero exceptions, zero deductions, and zero loopholes

</quote>

Our system is equal as it taxes the dollars earned, not the person. You are treated no differently than I am for the 10,000th dollar we each earn. Just like we aren't treated differently for the 1,000,000 dollar we both earn. The dollars are taxed not the person.

Are you that fucking ignorant??

Treating each dollar and each person equally.... the word AND... not the word OR... for when you treat dollar X by person Y differently than dollar A by person B, it is indeed unequal treatment...

How would you feel if then benefits were given under law by government for a person at dollar 60k, then more at dollar 200k, and even more at dollar 2mil?? It would be 'equal treatment' under your definition, because IF you then earned 2mil, you would have the exact same benefits...

The reason you advocate the reverse is nothing more than 'stickittothemanitis'.... it's ok because it is not you and because you FEEL they can afford it more, giving you more benefit from government at the expense of someone else...

Sales tax is an equal treatment tax.... progressive income tax is not... and that, whether you like it or not, is truth

</quote>

For the same reason, Sales tax is not equal treatment.

The ore you earn, the more you spend, the more sales tax youy pay copmpared to someone who earns less and thus spends less.

Yes. IMHO, the progressive tax scale is fair.

The problem isn't taxes, it spending. We need to force Congress to balance the budget.

</quote>

So you think people should be treated differently based on the money they make rather than being treated equal before the law...

How is that at all consistant with the idea that all men are created equal?

Everyone is treated the same under a progressive system. We both get taxed the same on our 10,000th dollar earned, we get taxed the same amount of our 100,000 dollar earned and we get taxed the same on our 1,000,000 dollar earned. Seems equal to me.

Actually, that's not true. The tax code is full of deliberate carve outs and byzantine rules which lead to unintended results. We do not get taxed the same based on income. Even the rules of what constitutes income are complicated.

Our current tax code is the product of some social engineering, some legitimate means to fund the government, and a whole bunch of corruption in the process.

That has to be the ultimate in demagoguery. The idea that you can tax someone's income without taxing him is about as idiotic as you can get.

It's hard to believe libturds have the nerve to spew such idiocies into a public forum

True. Our system is not as simple and ideal as I may have made it sound. There are plenty of loopholes, breaks and ways around the system that make it unfair. We need to clean up those loopholes and correct the system so the richest in our country can't continue to get richer and richer while the middle class get poorer and poorer.
