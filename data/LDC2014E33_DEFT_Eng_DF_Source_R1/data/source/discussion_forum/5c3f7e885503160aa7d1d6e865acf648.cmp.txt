If you and every other human on Earth could perform the task... you're not going to be paid as much as you would if you had a specialized skill... sorry.. that's the way it is and why fry cooks don't get experienced welder pay

</quote>

Then would you care to explain why so many people with degrees and other specialized skills are fry cooks and dishwashers? If noone needs a welder the special skill won't make you anything. Also there are many jobs that require a lot of trining and/or education, are very important to our society, and still don't pay much.

Which jobs are important,competitive, and don't pay much? If you say math/science teachers, the reason is because of union rules, which forbid paying some area teachers more than others.
Almost every instance of extended shortage is the result of gov't policies.

They just don't understand or accept that the demand for certain skills CHANGES.. and like in all other aspects of life, you have to adapt and overcome... not just sit there crying and waiting for someone to hand you what you need..

In ancient times.. these were the ones pouting that their old way of making spears was not working in the newer land with different animals.. and while sitting in the field pouting, the smilodon pounced and had them for lunch

OH, so you are talking about the Welfare Queen that Reagan talked about that didn't really exist. Are we going to talk about unicorns next? Lepruchauns?

The Unemployment rate isn't that important. a 5% unemployment rate where everyone has McJobs isn't an improvement. I would much rather have the Clinton UE of 3.9% where you could throw out a resume and get a better paying job in a month that you barely qualified for than the 6.3% UE of Bush where you couldn't get a job you totally qualified for because you were competing against 40 other guys who were just as qualifed.

Offshoring replaced good paying manufacturing jobs with service McJobs. That was NOT an improvement, guy. Bloodletting is not a valid medical treatment, either. We send out 500 billion in wealth every year to other countries, that's not a good thing.

I am talking about generations of unemployed and unemployable people. Don't tell me they dont exist. You ought to know better.
Your comparison of the Bush years with the Clinton years is a joke. But I have effectively refuted your point: off shoring was going like crazy during hte Bush years and there was more manufacturing going on here and less unemployment.
I am sorry you cannot compete against guys more qualified than you. Night school maybe?

Vocational School. Trade School. Charter Schools work Miracles in some of the most impoverished areas of NYC. Unfortunately the Teachers Union's work to discredit them. Bottom line good study habits happen best when the kids are reached earlier on.

What have the poor done to deserve our support?

Those of you who call yourselves Christians need not ask this question if you are a true follower of Christ.

Anyone who is a true follower of christ knows you give personally and from your own heart... not having it raped from you whether you have the calling to give it or not

And in a country based on freedom... you have the freedom to be a miserly prick too, even if ones like you don't like it and want to be generous with someone else's money

If this is going to be a Christian nation that doesnt help the poor, either we have to pretend that Jesus is just as selfish as we are or weve got to acknowledge that he commanded us to love the poor and serve the needy without condition. And then admit that we just dont want to do it.

 Stephen Colbert

An interesting thought he makes.

Involuntary charity forced by government to take care of someone else's personal needs is tantamount to rape, or theft, or whatever other little description work that can be used to show violation

No go play in traffic, you habitual liar
