There was a protest on Memorial Day at James Madison and I stopped down to see if there would be any attention paid to the purpose of the day.

There wasn't and for 2 1/2 hours I listened to anti-war boilerplate, and Bush lied etc. It was sad that the one day out of the year dedicated to our war dead was hijacked by a group of people more interested in making themselves feel good and playing politics. All it would have taken was one of the speakers saying let's take a minute to recognize the sacrifices of those who made it possible for us to com e here and complain.

Then Will Williams and Allen Ruff decided that free speech isn't really free and stood in front of my camera and then bum rushed me along with bald Tom Cruise. Pretty lame. I had caused no trouble and made only one statement out loud when the speaker said it's a good day to end all wars I said It's a better day to honor our dead. Other than that I spent the entire time peacefully watching. It was a pathetic display and in the end my patience was finished so I walked on stage and gave a little reminder of what Memorial Day is actually about. There are 364 other days a year to protest the war and the lack of respect shown does not reflect well on our local peaceniks.

Good job. You "honored" the dead by pestering a group of people who were interested in not creating any more dead?

You think that it's more important to honor the dead than work to prevent more death?

Oh, no, wait, protesting war isn't actually a way to spend one's time. There's no such thing as arguing for peace rather than a the continuation of a morbid death cult. It's not a protest for peace; it's "making themselves feel good and playing politics."

My god, you're an asshole.

Why did you want to interrupt their legal, peaceful gathering? Do you hate freedom?

I was taking a leisurely stroll with my family through the neighborhood and a band was beginning to jam at Rennebohm Park. Their first song was shit, so I sent Steadman and the kids and the dog home and I stayed for 2 1/2 hours to videotape the rest of the lousy gig.

The fucking audacity of that fucking band to fuck up my fucking Memorial Day and my fucking family time, and to make matters fucking worse, their fucking lame version of Rhiannon still fucking lingers.

Jimbo - they let you speak on stage - that is not taking away your freedom of speech.

They've been doing these protests for years.

If you wanted a parade or a traditional Memorial Day ceremony there were plenty to go to. No one forced you to go to the peace rally. You chose to go.

Will Williams and Allen Ruff are very peaceful people. They would never have hurt you, as much as you wanted them to. That would have made a really good video for Blackfive wouldn't it? All your pro-war and shoot 'em up buddies would have loved it.

Funny that the rally was 2 1/2 hours long but your video was only 5 minutes long. What did you edit out?
