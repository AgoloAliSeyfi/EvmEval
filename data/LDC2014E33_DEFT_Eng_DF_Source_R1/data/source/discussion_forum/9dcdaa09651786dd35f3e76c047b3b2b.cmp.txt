I guess this plays it part:

Libyan arms

The other source of IRA arms in the 1970s was Libya, whose leader, Muammar al-Gaddafi, sympathised with their campaign.[13] The first Libyan arms donation to the IRA occurred in 1972–1973, following visits by Joe Cahill to Libya. In early 1973, the Government of the Republic of Ireland received intelligence that the vessel Claudia was carrying a shipment of weapons, and placed the ship under surveillance on 27 March. On 28 March, three Irish Naval Service patrol vessels intercepted the Claudia in Irish territorial waters off the coast of Helvick Head, County Waterford, seizing five tonnes of Libyan arms and ammunition found on board. The weapons seized included 250 Soviet-made small arms, 240 rifles, anti-tank mines and other explosives. Cahill was found and arrested on board.[14][15] It is estimated that three shipments of weapons of similar size and makeup did get through to the IRA during the same time period.[16] Moloney reports that the early Libyan arms shipments furnished the IRA with its first RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade launchers, and that Gaddafi also donated three to five million US dollars at this time.[17] However contact with the Libyan government was broken off in 1976.

Contact with Libya was restored in the aftermath of the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike, which was said to have impressed Gadaffi. In the 1980s, the IRA secured larger quantities of weapons and explosives from Gaddafi's Libya — enough to supply at least two infantry battalions.[18] These shipments were as a direct result of Gaddafi's desire to strike at the British Government for their support and assistance during the US Air Force's bombing attacks on Tripoli and Benghazi in 1986. The USAF planes involved in the bombings had taken off from British bases on 14 April 1986. 60 Libyans died in the attack, including Gaddafi's adopted baby daughter Hanna. This second major Libyan contribution to the IRA came in 1986–1987. The arms shipments included:
An AK-47 Assault Rifle (over 1000 of which were donated by Gaddafi to the IRA in the 1980s)
RPG-7

* 9mm Browning, Taurus, Glock and Beretta handguns
* AK-47 Kalashnikov assault rifles
* MP5 submachine guns
* RPG-7 anti-tank rocket launcher
* Soviet made DShK heavy machine guns
* FN MAG machine guns
* Military flamethrowers
* Semtex plastic explosive
* Strela 2 man portable SAMs

However, on 1 November 1987, during transit to Ireland, one-third of the total Libyan arms consignment being carried aboard the MV Eksund (sometimes referred to simply as Eksund) was intercepted by the French Navy while the ship was in the Bay of Biscay,[19] along with five crew members, among them Gabriel Cleary. The vessel was found to contain 120 tonnes of weapons, including HMGs, 36 RPGs, 1000 detonators, 20 SAMs, Semtex and 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition.[20] Author Ed Moloney claimed that the Eksund shipment also contained military mortars and 106 millimetre cannon, an assertion never confirmed by the Irish authorities.[21] Despite the Eksund fiasco, the IRA was by then equipped with a quantity and quality of weaponry and explosives never available to them at any other phase of their history.[22] Furthermore, according to Brendan O'Brien there was actually an 'over-supply', specially regarding the 600 AK-47s still in the hands of the IRA by 1992.[23] There were four shipments before the Eksund which were not intercepted, in a huge intelligence failure of both Irish and British agencies described as 'calamitous' by author Brendan O'Brien.[22] The previous arm supplies from Libya developed as follows:

* The trawler Casamara took on ten tonnes of weapons in September 1985 off the Maltese island of Gozo. These weapons were landed off the Clogga Strand near Arklow by inflatable boats some weeks later. The shipment contained five hundred crates of AK-47s, pistols, hand grenades, ammunition and seven RPG-7s.
* The Casamara (renamed Kula at this time), left Maltese waters on 6 October 1985 carrying a cache of heavy machine guns.
* In July 1986, there was a shipment of fourteen tonnes, including, according to the authorities, two SAM-7s.
* In October 1986, another shipment of 80 which included one tonne of Semtex, reportedly ten SAM-7 missiles, more RPG-7s, AK-47s and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition arrived aboard the oil-rig replenishment Villa.[24]

It is also estimated that the Libyan government gave the IRA the equivalent of £2 million along with the 1980s shipments.[25]

Garda Síochána (Irish police) uncovered numerous arms destined for the IRA in 1988. These included several hundred AK-47s, Russian DSHK HMGs, FN MAG machine guns and Semtex.[25]
[edit] Compensation claims

On 31 October 2009, a cross-party delegation of Northern Irish politicians travelled to the Libyan capital Tripoli for the first face to face meeting with Libyan government ministers to discuss compensation claims for victims of IRA violence.[26]

If the majority of the country want change, then that's their right to fight for... They asked for help, so it's ok for us to provide it.

People should accept their political system for what it is. As humans are cruel, and middle-eastern morality is as it is, then they should accept the lot God gave them.

Besides, liberalism is a Western belief, not a middle-eastern belief. Therefore only Westerners can be truly liberal.
