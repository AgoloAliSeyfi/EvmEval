What about the black teens who chased and beat white fairgoers in Wisconsin.
The media didn't touch this story. This was a HUUUGE event. For no apparent reason a group of black teenagers systematically started chasing and hitting white people.
Nothing in the media.
A group of blacks dressed in uniform and carrying clubs outside a voting precinct and the racist liberals excused it. I would have LOVED to see what would have happened if a group of white racist dressed in Aryan militaristic garb carrying clubs outside a voting precinct would have resulted in the media....it would have been headline news for weeks. Or imagine a group of white teens attacking blacks coming out of a church or other gathering....a nuclear bomb could go off and you wouldn't have known it for the wall to wall coverage.
Both the media and liberals act in overt racism on a regular basis and then we have people like MarcATL trying to point the finger the other direction.
What a tool.

Blacks and white teen systematically beat up each other. nothing news worthy. Aryan whites do beat up and kill blacks but when did the black panthers kill or beat up anyone. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_boohoo.gif"/>
Bush administration did not see anything illegal or unlawful by the new black panthers standing on the side walk and white people entering the polling station not afraid. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_shifty.gif"/>

Black man with a stick in intimidating but a white man with a gun is not? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/confused.gif"/>
White woman behind them don't seem to be intimidated?
Black panthers were being harassed by white man with big mouth.

There's still yapping and squeeling on and on and on about two anonymous black dudes with a stick playing dress up. As if it's supposed to be some big deal.

White racist MFers walking around brandishing armed guns....no big deal.

These racist RWers never cease to amaze me.

It was on fox news Sunday.

However it's a non story other than for political opportunists.

I think the "bigger" story is, how many "leaders" that are for "racial equality" are demanding a lynching. I guess its okay if you are on the 'right' side of the rope?

It's the biggest, hottest news story in media.

Are they not a media company interesting in keeping the populate updated on the latest and greatest and hottest news?

Any of you wager to guess why such little coverage for the biggest, most powerful media organization on the world?
