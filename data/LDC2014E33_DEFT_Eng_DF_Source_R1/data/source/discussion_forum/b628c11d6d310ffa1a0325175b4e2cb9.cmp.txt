...actions by some of the protestors?

What Fox News/Republicans don't seem to understand is that the bigger a movement gets, the more trouble-makers it is going to attract. In other words, the trouble-makers at the OWS protests do not represent the movement itself. The OWS from the very beginning had a message of peaceful protesting. That is what the founders of the movement intended. Unfortunately, because the movement is leaderless and has become so wide-spread, some of them have gotten chaotic. That is a human-driven consequence; it is not because of the ideology.

I think it is reasonable to criticize the OWS movement as lacking clear goals and leadership. If it did have these qualities, I think more people would take their message more seriously. However, by that same rationale, it is unfair to criticize the movement itself for a few of the trouble-makers.

Let me put it this way: if the Tea Party had become as popular movement as the OWS has (not even close), would the movement have attracted the same kind of law-breakers we see at these OWS protests? The answer is absolutely.

A few tea party people had some signs at their rallies
that some didn't care for.so what happened? the whole tea party
was branded as racist and according to Chris Mathews,all white.

the Odoriferous Wasteoid Slacker movement is nothing but a nuiscence.... to claim it has any credibility with anyone other than Marxists and other assorted crazies is fucking delusional. It isn't even covered by news outlets for the most part.
