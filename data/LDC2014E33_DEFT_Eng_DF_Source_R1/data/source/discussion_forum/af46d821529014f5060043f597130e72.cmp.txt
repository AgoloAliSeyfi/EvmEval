JamesMorrison--
Your preceding post... Masterfully stated.

Instead of claiming entitlement, these organizations could devote their resources to actually achieving the goal of providing their perceived charges with a quality pre-university education. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to obtain and earn their education and not to universities to guarantee demographic academic balance. Those so graduating would possess the rightful pride that comes from pursuing such a path and society would be rewarded with productive members possessing this hard earned self-assurance.

Fairness, non-discrimination should be the goal. Manipulation to cull favorable results is just more discrimination--and I'm not thinking of discrimination against white students. In the long run, the ones harmed, IMO, are generations of those trained to rely on AA.

There was a very interesting report in the NYTimes -- probably Thursday-- about a school in the Boston area in which affirmative action on a racial basis was exchanged for an economic basis. Worth looking at.

Tartin,

Regarding your post of Sat May 10, 2003 4:24 pm about the school in Boston, do you have a specific link or other reference? This sounds interesting.

Thanks,

JM

I'll see if I can find one, James. I've recycled my papers, so it will depend on the NYTimes' search engine!

Tell me what you think of the story, James, when you have a moment.

Tartan,

Cambridge's school system has its heart in the right place but seems to be backing the wrong horse. It obviously wants to achieve "racial balance" but how does this educate the little kids? There is some benefit that can be ascribed to the aforementioned balance but at this point I think it only allows the child to be able to repeat the mantra:

"I have nothing against poor folk, why even some of my friends are poor!"

This program is troubling because most of it is concerned with some sort of integration, which is accomplished by literally injecting "White" into "Minority" or "Middle Class" into "Poor" educational settings. This seems to miss the point of equality in public school education.

In the article we find that:

"Proponents of economic integration say there is ample evidence that all children learn better at schools where middle-class students are in the majority."

And this from Richard D. Kahlenberg:

"While there are a handful of exceptions, in general high-poverty schools don't work,..."

But why is this? Later in the article we get a glimpse of cause:

"Middle- and upper-middle-income parents tend to be more aggressive about making sure their schools have everything, from top teachers to special arts programs, experts said. "Middle-class parents provide quality control,"

So maybe Economic Integration will work, but Ms. Bokhari, mother of Noah, the featured token middle class kid in the article cited as hope for this experiment intimates:

"Noah would probably return to Fletcher-Maynard (the school singled out in the article) next year. After that, she is not sure. Her oldest son, Essah, a second grader at another public school where, Ms. Bokhari said, he was not sufficiently challenged, would be attending Shady Hill, a high-achieving, $14,000-a-year private school. Noah may eventually follow, she said. "

Sounds like "Middle-Class Flight", but is Ms. Bokhari an economic bigot? No, she just wants the best Education she can afford for her children.

The article also introduces us to Omar Maxwell, Noah's best friend and classmate. We then learn that Omar's Mom:

"Ms. Maxwell said she did not believe her son needed middle-income classmates to succeed. "It all depends on the teachers," she said."

So then, it's not rocket science. (I am not calling Ms. Maxwell's intellect into question here. She is studying to be a nurse, God Bless her. Alas, I cannot say the same for this school system's reasons for this program.)

Then we have this resultant perversion:

"With all its benefits -- classes capped at 17 students, experienced teachers, the district's only full-time art teacher for kindergarten through eighth grade, computers for all fifth graders and above -- Fletcher-Maynard still has 47 vacancies. There is a waiting list of low-income children from the neighborhood. But under the plan the available slots must be held for middle-class families"

So this program, borne of economic equality, has 47 open slots for which poor kids must wait until it fills its target of kids from a wealthier background. Surley Cambridge can do better.

But educator Ms. Harris is hopeful:

"If we had 100 percent children of color and poor, we'd still get the job done," she said. "You set the bar high, and they excel."

I suspect these children need more academic resources applied directly on their own behalf and less of a remedy for social reconstruction that involves a:

"... complicated lottery that takes into account family income, siblings, proximity, and -- as a last resort if a school falls out of racial balance -- race. "

As I declared before, give the younger Americans the equal education promised them and the diversity will take care of itself.
