It's just that private schools have generally the more cleverer students and so because of this, there is an expectation to do well. So the students put the effort in and get the grades. It's not about being rich at all, I go to a private school (technically a grammar school but still fee paying) and most people are just middle-class. The level of education isn't that much different to state schools, yes the teachers care more because everyone wants to do well but that's it. I've been to both state schools and private schools.

It doesn't matter what kind of school you go to, if you put the effort in, you can achieve what you want to achieve...

Think about this for a second. Should private healthcare be banned as well?
I know many people who have had their grandparents pay for their private education and they come from a poor family. You are an idiot if you think that all private school students are rich, they are not and for most middle class parents it's affordable.

Then vote for a government that will improve the disgrace that is state education - i.e. don't vote lib / lab.

If private schools weren't better at educating their students than state schools (on the whole) then parents wouldn't send their children to them. As it is. On the whole they are better. So the obvious solution is not to punish these schools that are doing better (that would be counter productive madness), but to improve the quality of current state schools, and even arguably go so far as to re-introduce grammar schools so that children who are not from well off backgrounds, but who have good academic potential can have that potential properly nurtured.

This is coming from a state school student by the way.

What would people say to the following idea for ridding the world of private schools?

Everybody is educated in their local school based on catchment area (going from a primary school to a secondary school after year 6). An independent body will have to regulate that areas in "poor" areas are within 5% of people gaining level 5's as the best ones.)
In year 9, you do an exam (not the SATs, something new). The better you do, the higher on the ballot you are to pick your GCSEs i.e. the better you do, the first pick you get. Everybody does the same core subjects.
Similarly, after your GCSEs, the better you do, the higher up on the ballot you are once more to pick A-Levels or other higher-education qualification. This could be based on a UCAS-point type sytem. An independent body would regulate each college to make sure A-Level /other teaching are within 10% of each other.

Perhaps this is a rubbish plan, it probably has lots of flaws. It seems something similar is necessary to make schools more competitive (i.e. the ballot system). But perhaps this is a far too right-wing idea in a left-wing school system.
