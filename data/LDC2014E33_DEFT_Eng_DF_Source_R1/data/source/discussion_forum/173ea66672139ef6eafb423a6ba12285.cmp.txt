The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA, Pub.L. 95-128, title VIII of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1977, 91 Stat. 1147, 12 U.S.C. § 2901 et seq.) is a United States federal law designed to encourage commercial banks and savings associations to help meet the needs of borrowers in all segments of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.[1][2][3] Congress passed the Act in 1977 to reduce discriminatory credit practices against low-income neighborhoods, a practice known as redlining.[4][5 ]

We see how that "consistent with safe and sound operaton" worked out.

The fact is that loans made by CDA affected banks were actually better than loans made by other institutions <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/12/04/dont-blame-cra-the-sequel/">[cite].</a> Here's the pertinent quote:

<quote orig_author="galveston">
Loans originated by lenders regulated under CRA in general were significantly less likely to be in foreclosure than those originated by independent mortgage companies that werent covered by CRA.

Are you saying that the bankers would have made loans to people who could not pay for them without government prompting or gaurantees against loss? That is the starting point or basis for all that followed.

I doubt those bankers are dense enough to do that.

The only part that ACORN had was to actively find customers (a lot of them) for those sub-prime mortgages. It somehow seems immoral to me to encourage people take out loans that they have nearly zero chance of repaying. As we see in hindsight, it caused a major upheaval.

To the OP: I think our side blew the debt deal on at least one major point. They let the next fight on this subject come after the 2012 elections. Obama was desparate (i believe) to not have that discussion during his campaign.

Dead wrong again. The subprime mortgages were dreamed up by banks and the mortgage companies. They were making so much money when the good ones ran out, that they directed the lenders to drop standards. They took no risk. They packaged and sold them in minutes.They created CDOs and made trillions of dollars. In order to make that work, the bankers forced the rating agencies to rate all their crappy packages AAA.
Fannie was not the driving force at all.
