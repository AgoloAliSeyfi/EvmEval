I had the same problem when I first got my puppy. She would pee/poop in her crate without a second thought (she was paper trained before we got her). I think it was partially anxiety and partially because she was still in potty-training...her breed is known to be difficult and she's extremely attached to me. She follows me everywhere and doesn't listen to anyone but me...which annoys the hell out of my DF.

When I first crate trained her, I slept/stayed within sight of her until she got comfortable with me being away. Now she will stay in her crate quietly without leaving me presents to clean up. Maybe you should try putting your dog in the crate for short periods of time while you're at home (and able to watch for pee/poop), so when you do go out she doesn't feel abandoned...she just thinks you're in another part of the apartment.

This may not be relevant, but is she spayed? People forget that female dogs that are unspayed mark just like male dogs do. If your male is unneutered, and your female is unspayed it could be her marking because of him. It may not be the case, but it's something to think about.

Edit: Also I wanted to add that my dog that was rescued from a puppy mill does not care at all where she poops or pees. She would pee in her crate for the longest time after we got her. She would even poop in her bed, and then lay in it.

The bf put boxes in the crate to make it smaller. So far she tinkled a little in there, we put an older white towel in there and it had a small yellow spot. Her crate is kinda big for her size, but that's the size crate the bf found when we first got her and since she was okay since October we assumed it was okay. OUr tiny male dachshund has a huge crate and he doesn't potty in there, she was the same with hers.

She is spayed, we spayed her a little over a month ago.

We don't know her history as she was a stray when someone gave her to us. This boy gave her to my bf's roommates at the time and said he found her. This boy is sketchy as it is so who knows.

So far we're doing a lot better. I was just getting fed up and not sure if I could deal with her and having a baby soon. I don't want to get rid of her cause she is part of my family so I am trying to avoid that.

The crate I keep my puppy in is tiny...about the size of a cat carrier. Then again, my dog is under 4 lbs so it's plenty big for her.

You should think about picking up a smaller one. They're pretty inexpensive.
