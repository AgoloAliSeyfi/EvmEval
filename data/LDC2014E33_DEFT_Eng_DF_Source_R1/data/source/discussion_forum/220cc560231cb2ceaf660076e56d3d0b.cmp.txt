They went to sleep as Syrians and woke up stripped of their citizenship and their rights to study, work, or marry as they wish.

Such was the fate of 120,000 Syrian Kurds who became people with no country in 1962, when they were purged from the Syrian population in a politically motivated one-day census, the Washington, D.C.-based humanitarian group Refugees International said in a new report Tuesday.

Today, their ranks have swollen to 300,000 and their plight is such that one Syrian Kurdish man interviewed by the group described it as "like being buried alive." [..]

The Kurds disowned in 1962 officially were branded "foreigners" but since they enjoyed citizenship nowhere else, they were condemned to statelessness. They have only spotty access to education, health care, and employment--rights enjoyed by other Syrians, the report said. They face difficulty in owning businesses and property.

"Even registering a marriage, traveling outside of the country or changing one's residence is a particular challenge for Syrian Kurds," Refugees International said. [..] Those hardships are faced not only by the generation written off in 1962 but also by their heirs. [..]

The government recognizes Kurdish children's right to primary education but stateless Kurds face trouble getting into secondary school and college, according to Refugees International.

Stateless Kurds also are barred from government jobs and from practicing law or medicine. They are allowed to work in some, but not all, teaching and engineering jobs. Stateless Kurdish men cannot legally marry Syrian women, according to the report.

Kurds are barred from using their language in conversation, publications, and in the naming of their children. They face interrogation, detention, and torture, according to the report.

All this is the result of a 1962 census officially conducted to identify foreigners said to have crossed the border from Turkey illegally, Refugees International said. In fact, it added, the head-count formed part of a drive to 'Arabize' Syria's resource-rich northeast.

''To retain their citizenship, Kurds had to prove residence in Syria prior to 1945, but many Kurds with proof of residence lost their nationality anyway,'' the organization said.

The issue has haunted Syria and periodically has spilled over into public protest, regional uprisings and, in 2004, major race rioting sparked by a soccer match, according to rights watchdog Amnesty International.

Elsewhere in the papers, meanwhile, we hear of the Dutch Immigration service allowing a Syrian government delegation to come to Holland and question Syrian deportees (some of whom rejected asylum-seekers who risk persecution if the Syrian state finds out they applied for asylum) - oh, and when the Syrian state reps asked if all Dutch officials could please leave the room while they had a talk with these people one-on-one, the Dutch of course swiftly agreed. I mean, why not? &lt;sighs&gt;
