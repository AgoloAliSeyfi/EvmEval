It is slowly recovering on its own despite Obamas policies and business crunching regulations. I am very glad it is coming around but I just wish we could vote Obama out now to expedite the process.

My prediction is that if Obama loses the election growth will double the current snails pace its growing at. In fact I bet upon the news alone that he loses the election we will start seeing firms hire and invest exponentially.

...the number of layoffs nationwide caused by government regulation is minuscule and shows no evidence of getting worse during the Obama administration. Lack of demand for business products and services is vastly more important.

Nice quote and all...

But the concern was that regulations would curtail the hiring BACK of people already laid off....not result in further lay offs.

Companies had trimmed themselves down to the bare miunimum....no one was really looking at additional layoffs....with the exception of companies going out of business.

You quoted an article that does not at ALL address the issue of regulations costing employers money that they may otherwise invest back into the company so they can bring it back tot he size it was before the recession.

The quote doesn't, but the article itself does. It shows that it is a myth that regulations curtail job growth at any signficant level. This is according to a CONSERVATIVE economist and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

So sueing companies like Boeing because they want to build in a state his "friends" don't control is not hurting job growth? Or regulating farm dust or putting light bulb companies out of business or stopping oil drilling for so long all the platforms went to other countries instead of waiting or any other numerous stupid decision he has made.

The point is, any economic growth that Obama is inhibiting is miniscule in comparison to other factors. Rather than blaming politicians, we need to blame the state of the market.

</quote>

Maybe but he has had a hand in the demise of tens of thousands of jobs. Minuscule as that may be, explain that to those who have lost out because of him or his administration.

Let me ask you this question....

If you were about to open a lemon aid stand...and your business plan allowed for an 8% NET profit by the end of your 3rd year...but a large personal investment to start.....

But there was word coming from Washington that the EPA, with the Presidents blessing, was going to pass new regulations on the purchasing and use of lemons....nothing concrete....nothing for sure....just word going around....

Would you dive into the venture...or wait until you knew what the EPA was going to do?

He also had a hand in creating close to 3 million jobs.

any given regulation...perhaps not..

But knowing that there is a large influx of regulations...and many more to come?

It is that "concern for the unknown" that stymies economic growth.

Knowiung what the regulation is allows one to compensate..and move forward.

Not knowing what is to come and how much it will cost? That si what we are referring to..

And we have a regulation happy administration right now...that you cant deny.
