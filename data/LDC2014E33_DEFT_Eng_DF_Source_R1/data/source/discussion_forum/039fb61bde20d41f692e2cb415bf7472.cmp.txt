1. A parlimentary based democracy in the middle ages, I mean middle east.

2. Freed 28 millionn people from a socialist, murdering dictator.

So you tout these two "accomplishments" yet you believe this:

I think it's funny--and a great waste of money/energy to think other cultures can adopt our western judeo christian ideals and morals.
</quote>

yup.
Real life isn't perfect, it's a trade-off of things. The only place real, actual life is faked/thought to be perfect is in the liberal/progressive coffee shops, their co-ops and university classsrooms.

Ex: in order to get #1, you have to do #2.

<quote>
Why should these other cultures be any more likely to adopt our political ideals as well? Because we know what's best for the world?
</quote>

BINGO!
Liberal/progressive rant and rail all about "Celebrate Diversity!" yet are exceedingly narrow in what they accept, much less "celebrate". I'm a strong "culturalist". I accept cultures as they are and not try to change them from the outside. If asians want to sell their kids for sex for $5, let them. If ME wants to enslave women and dogs and have sex with little boys, let them. If africans want to rape girls to cure HIV, let them. etc.

Only INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM can change any of those things.

And #1 and #2 are done, INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM happens and more people will have input into their society (unlike cuba/vietnam/venezuela/etc.) and more "rights" bestowed upon them. Who knows, mebbe some day they'll stop having sex with little boys and women will be free?
But going right to that step will only work in the liberal/progressive fantasy arenas.

But let them live their own lives in their own cultures and keep our money here. This is where the world socialist UN needs to be given the boot from the US and ignored. They are corrupt, selling/trading oil with saddam, raping, watching 875,000 men/women/children raped and hacked to death in rwanda, etc.
They only want power over every individual in the world--the antithesis of INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM.
Screw them.

There's still some murderous dictators out there. Why aren't we coming to the rescue of their natural resources.....oops, I mean victims?
</quote>

See above 3 points.
Plus, we'd not have been able to go into afghanland w/the UNs saddam still in power and not have him meddle in that in hopes of causing the US major problems. Now iran had parlimentary democracies on two sides of it. Problems for carter's mullah ran iran.

<quote orig_author="Tiggs">
3. Stopped saddam's WMD program.
</quote>

Thanks, I like a good laugh with my coffee.
</quote>

Ask the kurds if he had any WMDs.
Ask Iran.
Read the UN's IAEA report.
Then have your coffee--but doing that might interfere with your programming.

That's cute, your mother's use of the word
</quote>

Please leave my mother out of your filthy mouth son.
And also, please don't include any of my sons/daughters in your vile orifice either.

You are getting into the arena of vile and disgusting, so that earns you strong "liberal/progressive" points.
[I'm surprised that this board doesn't have a lot of the "palin porn/rape" threads so common on madison's socialist dot com board].

And your "apolitical" ideology/worldview seems to be a direct overlay of the liberal/progressive ones.
Honesty does seem to be quite the challenge for liberal/progressives, or those having their behavioral characteristics and have their ideology/worldview....

Your harsh and vile criticisms know no boundaries.....but you expect me to spare anyone unfortunate enough to share your blood?

Now you've lost even me. Have fun talking to yourself.
