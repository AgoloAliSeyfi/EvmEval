LOL that's funny, I love Karma, it's fun sometimes.
Yeah, it's fine...I mean, I know that a car is a material posession, but I like to keep my stuff looking nice if I can help it. If "I" bang it up and make it look like trash then that's on me. I don't appreciate other people helping me do it. KWIM?

I know that lady saw me, she was just being a b***h and didn't want to acknowledge she hit my car.

But on the bright side, There's so much SNOW out there right now you can't see my car.

SEE!

Ahahahaha, "Big ass pile of snow"

Good lord, woman. That is more snow than I care to see ever (And I live in Wisconsin, so I'm used to it too [maybe not to alaska standards though]. I just hate it!)

I would have shouted "WHAT THE FU**!!!!" And got this horrified look on my face and just mean mugged the crap outta her.

AUGH, why do people have NO respect for anyone anymore. It's like they think they own the place. "I'm old, I was here longer than you!" Too bad, this still ain't your world, you @#$@#$(%*%(*$($*%(*% Etc.

When I was pregnant, someone tried to run me over too. Looking back on it, I should have flashed her.

"CAN YOU SEE ME NOW?!" Lift shirt.

Hehe yeah, we get LOTS of snow. In 2002 we got 36 inches in 12 hours, basically I parked my car in my drive way, woke up the next day and all I could see was this little car antenna sticking up out of the driveway. I cried. I had to shoved the deck off AND the whole driveway, by myself, with a itty bitty shovel.
We get snow, not as much as some places but I love the temperature difference of about 100+ degrees in some places....(like Fairbanks 60 in the summer and -60 in the winter)

Yeah, I had a few choice words for her. I curse worse than a sailor so I felt it was best to think about those choice words for her.
And I truly LOATHE people who think just because they're older than me they own the world...OR those who say, "You're people repressed my people".
SORRY WALDO! My ancestors were no where NEAR this land when it as "taken over by white people". They were still in Europe when all that went down, so SUCK IT!

I hate it when this happens, someone got out their car who had parked right next me and opened their door right into my car. They didn't realise I was there as I was not in the car but walking towards it. I said to them, you manage to get out of your car alright or was my car door in your way ?

There was no damage but, Honestly some people !!
