Democrats have been saying that they are all for the elimination of private health insurance. Don't believe me, watch the videos in this thread:

How many jobs will that costs? I am not just talking about the CEOs and upper management jobs but how many jobs of people like you and me who work hard every day just to put dinner on the table will be lost. From the Janitor to middle management and don't forget the little guys, the independent agents who work for you to get you coverage. Those CEO's employ you; your brothers, sisters, parents, children, friends.

Where are those people going to go when the private health insurer disappears?

How many hundreds of thousands of jobs (Democrat jobs) are going to be lost? What industry do you work in?

Is your job safe?

edit: Oh and let me ask you this, aren't you glad Barney Frank and Barack Obama are working so hard to eliminate those jobs?

Regional inequities in health care reform
Posted on October 15th, 2009 by kbh in featured, health

In the pending health care bills, low-income individuals and families who buy health insurance outside employment will get large government subsidies. Those subsidies vary by locale. This represents a significant implicit policy decision with enormous distributional and political consequences. I dont think most Members or their constituents have focused on this. I think they should...

Now lets look at what the Baucus bill does for the new low-income subsidies to purchase health insurance outside of employment. Here is the key sentence from the conceptual description of the Senate Finance Committee-reported bill (labeled as page 27, its page 30 of the PDF).

The premium credit amount would be tied to the second lowest-cost silver plan in the area where the individual resides.

This is approach (2) (and it becomes clear its the extreme when you study the details). If you live in an area with relatively inexpensive health plans, low- and moderate-income people in your area will receive smaller government subsidies than their similarly-situated identical twins who live in relatively high-cost areas.

A health plan is not a commodity like a gallon of milk. A health plan in Las Vegas is quite different from one in Portland. While the overall cost-of-living in Portland is higher, health care spending is much higher in Las Vegas. This higher health spending is a function of different prices and different usage of medical care.

Atul Gawande wrote a much-discussed article on this topic in The New Yorker, The Cost Conundrum: What a Texas town can teach us about health care. There are wide geographic dispersions in medical care spending, and it cannot all be explained by different prices. While I disagree with Gawandes policy conclusions, I recommend the article....
