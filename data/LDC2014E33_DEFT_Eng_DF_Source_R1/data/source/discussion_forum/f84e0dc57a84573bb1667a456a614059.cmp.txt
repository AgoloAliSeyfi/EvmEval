Now he's saying that SHE should apologize to HIM:

"I don't think it's that big of a deal," Profitt told WKYT. "I would like for her to apologize to me to be honest with you."

While the victim, Lauren Valle, said Tuesday that she believed the campaign workers' violent reaction to her presence there was "premeditated," Profitt told WKYT that he thought Valle was following a strict protocol with the intent of creating controversy.

"She's a professional at what she does," Profitt said, "and I think when all the facts come out, I think people will see that she was the one that initiated the whole thing."

He then blamed the forceful downward motion of his foot on the head of Valle as a function of chronic back pain, a claim he has made before:

"I put my foot on her, and I did push her down at the very end, and I told her to stay down. I actually put my foot on her to -- I couldn't bend over because I have issues with my back," Profitt said.

Next excuse (#9 I think) It's the fault of the police:

<quote orig_author="Measure for Measure">
Lexington Police began an assault investigation identifying Profitt as a suspect. "Well I'll just say it, if the police had done what they were supposed to do, it would have never happened," Profitt said.

How so? The latest poll in that link was taken Oct. 24, before this incident occurred.

Good call. I saw the Oct. 28 date and thought it was a new poll. Ignorance fought.

In related news, <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/local-opinions/2010/10/eric_cantors_layers_of_defense.html">Dem arrested at Eric Cantor (R-VA) event.</a>

<quote orig_author="Measure for Measure">
And his refusal to debate his opponents raises questions about his newly found populism. One critic dresses up as a chicken and follows Cantor around as he campaigns claiming that the congressman is afraid to debate.

Cantor also has a tendency to surround himself with layers of defense, as was the case Monday when he appeared at a coffee shop in the small town of Louisa, supposedly to meet voters.

One man attending was John Taylor, a member of the Louisa County Democratic Committee and a backer of Rick Waugh, Cantor's Democratic opponent. Taylor and two others were asked to leave the coffee shop. County police then subdued Taylor, as can be seen in a video shot by his son with his cell phone.

As Taylor was asked to leave private property by the owner of the property (the coffee shop owner), there is nothing really you can pin on Cantor's campaign in this instance.

Update: this may not have been true when I posted it, but it certainly seems true now.
