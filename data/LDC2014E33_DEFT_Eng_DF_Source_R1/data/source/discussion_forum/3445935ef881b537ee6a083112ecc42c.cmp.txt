"This memo showed that the Japanese were offering surrender terms virtually identical to the ones ultimately accepted by the Americans at the formal surrender ceremony on September 2 -- that is, complete surrender of everything but the person of the Emperor."

Have you never realized the Potsdam Declaration was designed to inhibit Japan's surrender so the a-bombs could be used?

Weber is not my source either you dumbfuck. That's the second time you've falsely accused a source I've not used. But you want to call others stupid......lol.

Poor, poor foolish curvey, linked to Mark Weber's IHR article, and doesn't even understand who he's quoting.... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Madeline, have you ever responded to the fact our top military leaders all agreed the bombs were not necessary?

CurveLight, I am not the arbiter here. All USMB-ers get to have the same weight given their opinions. I'm just asking questions because I'm dumbfounded that there is (apparently) disagreement as to the historical facts.

</quote>

It is an indisputable historical fact that the top US military leaders agreed the bombs were not necessary.

What do you think about that fact? I'm beginning to doubt the sincerity of your OP since you have side stepped this at least 4 times.

</quote>

They were wrong. Once again the Japanese had no intention of surrendering. Even after 2 atomic Bombs the Army which controlled the Government REFUSED to surrender.

"Indesputable fact"

Like the Holocaust, huh? Your sources also claim that it did NOT happen.

Idiot.

Or, they never agreed to any such thing: Curvey's source is bogus: You may as well be arguing with someone that claims it was an "Indesputable fact" that Martians agreed the A bombs were not necessary, and quotes an article from the National Enquirer.

I don't give a damned if it was ethical or not. it ended the war and saved millions of AMERICAN lives. bottom line for me.

and i not going with this innocent civilian crap. they were working in factory's and making weapons to kill us.

the Japs murdered million of women and children in occupied countries. or do we let that slide??? they got what they deserved.

Yes, women and children died in the Phillipines and elsewhere. They ALSO died in Germany, at the hands and bombs of the Allies. Civilians in battlefields do die. If the Japanese Army engaged in widespread genocide of the peoples of the Pacific Islands, I have not heard that. Genocide in/by Germany yes, but Japan no.

But since when are unarmed civilians, especially children, cannon fodder? How many infants died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, namvet? What weapons did they help manufacture? What sort of warfare ethics AIMS to kill civilians?

The POV I take is that if we ONLY dropped the A-Bomb to show off our shiney new weapon to scare the Russians, etc., it was wrong. If we did it to force the surrender of Japan, it was right.
