All the eveidence shows this to be a new movement that is unprecedented. They had no organization or organizational skills and maybe even a lack of awarness as to how many people were in the "club". Thesea are middle classed people, middle aged people without a history of rallies or marches.

They are not made up of the usual zombietime bums, college students or ACORN bussed in hacks and SEIU union thugs or commie funded ANSWER geeks. The Tea Party people are working stiffs with day jobs and families. They are a pissed off and unaffiliated new breed of political monster that no one knows what to make of yet.

But we do know what created them, Pelosi/Reid/Obama greed!

lol...

They have a buttload of corporate sponsors and FOX News behind him.

They "have" FOX because FOX News reports on newsworthy events. (like a rally in Washington bigger than MLK's... that's "news")

Corporate sponsors by the "buttload"? Can you name three?

Well that was a little more effort than linking to the google home page, lol.

That gets you, once again, Fox News and the right wing version of MoveOn called Freedom Works. (not to be confused with FreedomWorks llc which is, apparently an evil wind power corporation) Then again, news organisations are supposed to cover protest and marches, let alone movements of significant size.

FOX News has their people there cheering these protests on.

Can you imagine Keith Olbermann or some MSNBC reporter at an anti-war rally a few years ago cheering them on and the reaction the right would have to that?

Tomorrow is the State of the Union and Obama will be talking about the huge deficit we have. Why didn't we ever hear about it during the Bush admin when during his admin the national debt was more than doubled? The deficits were huge!

But Bush hid them. He didn't put the two wars in the budget like Obama is doing. Remember all those emergency supplementals that congress voted on every few months? 250 billion here, 500 billion there, to fund the wars. We don't have those anymore, because the wars are funded, out in the open, by the budget.

But now, we see the deficit spending that these wars are causing, and suddenly everyone's all outraged.

This money has been draining our treasury for 8 years already.

The 2009 debt number is from the Bush administration's fiscal year. When they post the 2010 numbers, that will be Obama's.

So I was just wondering why the media is so stupid? They keep talking about the huge deficit in the Obama admin. But they never mentioned the doubling of the national debt under the Bush admin. Are they really so stupid that they didn't realize all those war supplementals weren't in the budget and therefore hidden away each year?

If you expect anyone to believe that in the 8 years Bush was in office, that the deficit was not news, your nuts.

Further, why do you Obama supporters keep going back to Bush to try and defend Obama? Whatever decisions Obama makes are his, he owns them, period. Yes, we understand what he came into office facing, but, his choices on how to handle it, are his and no one else's.

He and you, his supporters would gain much more respect if you stopped trying to shove off what he owns, onto Bush or others!
