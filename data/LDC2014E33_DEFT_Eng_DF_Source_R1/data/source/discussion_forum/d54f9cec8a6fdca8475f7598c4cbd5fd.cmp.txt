Maybe they just report the facts and don't waste time creating faux outrage without some legally sound facts to back it up?

Maybe they don't want to whip up hatred for the sake of ratings?

Maybe they don't like race baiting?

Wipe your chin, Marc, you're drooling again.

Ok, lay off the sauce. This is FOXNEWS we're talking about. They whip up Obama hatred on a daily, sometimes hourly, basis.

Even their website stokes fear and hatred of Obama:

Earlier, it had a story about Obama's trip to Oklahoma this morning to announce the pipeline construction, and their headline was "Obama's Pipe Dream".

They are just not honest actors.

Everyone knows that CalifornaGurl is the biggest, lyingest, boozing whino on the Interwebs.

You can smell the booze coming out of her pores a mile a way. She stinks to high-heaven of it.

Don't you see how she's always running off at the mouth spewing total nonsensical swill?

</quote>

And, that's what I mean about reigning in emotions. You're mad at her and you're saying stuff that everyone knows you have no first hand knowledge of it.

Sorta cringeworthy, I say.

FOXnews Latino has concluded Zimmerman isn't white AND many questions remain:

I just turned to The FOXNEWS in time to hear the panel discussing Obama's birth certificate. The Spanish TV babe was just finishing up a tirade about Obama's birth certificate!!

No sooner did I post about it than The FOXNEWS manifest their nonsense.

That has GOT to be some kind of record.

Because they're not part of the State run media, they are not an extension of the Obama re-election campaign. Thus, they weren't given orders to run the same race bait story over and over to stir up racial divisions more. Thats exactly what the Hussein wants, he wants the chaos, he wants the outrage to be rampant throughout society, and the main stream media is happy to oblige.

True..FOX is state run media. But it's not part of anything Obama is doing. The Saudis run FOX.

</quote>

So, owning a 7% share of a company means they 'run' Fox.... is that your assertion?

Seriously?

Naw..no swallow for you Sandy..

Aren't the construction workers near Piccadilly Circus enough for you? You still haul them two by two into the phone booths?

Man..your quick.

Regardless, what she said stands. A single person's 7% interest in an entity does not equate to it being state run.

Well, at least in this dimension.

Mad can be motivating, but being in an extended state of anger does not foster rational thought.
