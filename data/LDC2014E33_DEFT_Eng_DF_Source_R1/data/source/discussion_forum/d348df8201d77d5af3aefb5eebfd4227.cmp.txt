I believe that women should be allowed in all roles in all the Forces, on several caveats. Before anyone accuses me of misogyny or anything, I don't believe men are superior to women, we're just different.
Anyway:

1. Most importantly - the training, fitness requirements and general standards are NOT to be 'dumbed down' there will be one timing, one weight, one distance etc for ALL.
2. The Forces, or at least combat-roled units are MALE dominated. There will therefore be casual (joking) sexism, 'dick and fart' jokes, political incorrectness (sp?) and all the trappings of a male environment. If you can't deal with that without crying sexism and suing the Army, don't join.
3. You will NOT get any special/preferential treatment because you are female. This means no allowances on rag week (as is current policy, I believe), no separation of Male/Female ablutions, accommodation etc.
4. You will NOT sleep with your fellow soldiers, male or female, in the same unit or chain of command.

There are others, but that's all I've got off the top of my head.

However, there are many reasons why I also feel women should not serve in combat roles.

1. I don't want my mates shagging each other when they should be on guard duty, cleaning their rifles etc.
2. I wouldn't want my officers to be more concerned with shagging hot Pte. Jones than leading us properly.
3. I wouldn't want to be delegated to do the more dangerous ones if my boss felt it was too risky for a woman.
4. I don't think the laws of nature say an average woman can take on your average man in a hand to hand situation and come out on top, or at least without severe injury.
5. I don't think there are many women out there that can face the bitter reality of what WILL happen to them if captured (rape, torture, etc)
6. I honestly don't think that there are many women who can complete courses like P-Coy WITHOUT standards being dropped.

Oh, and if you want the official line: <a href="http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/A9925...fullreport.pdf">http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/A9925...fullreport.pdf</a>

Yes.

Women are perfectly capable of serving as front line troops. History provides numerous examples of them doing so.

Personally, i think if a female wants to do it, and can prove she has the abilities, she should be allowed.

But then who will carry around her items all the time if said person cannot do so? Surely this means she is not fit enough?

Though I do believe that if they are physically strong enough to carry out the task then they should be able to do so. But there are lots of other factors to consider, so I guess this isn't really straight forward.

I obviously don't have a lot of common sense. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/> Please ignore that sentence, it was stupid to say the least.
