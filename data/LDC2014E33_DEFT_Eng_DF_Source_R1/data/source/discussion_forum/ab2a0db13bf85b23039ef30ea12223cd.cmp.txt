Politics and conflict are human choice and as such not part of the discussion.

As for the circulation changing -- SO? This would hardly be the first time it has been ice free. The last time it was ice free for a long time Britain had a tropical climate -- so did the tropics. The palm tree franchise I bought for DC back in the 70s might finally pay off.

And Britian wasn't in it's present latitude at the time, hardly comparable.

The land is the land. It is the same as it is in places less frozen. The northern limit of farming is determined by temperature not soil. The soil does not magically change just north of the current temperature limit.

As to the land there is an asterisks load of it in Canada and Siberia that is flat and virgin. The young US advertised for immigrants selling the virgin farm land available for the taking.

Try growing wheat (or even rice) on a peat bog - soil type is vital and defrosted tundra is not good arable land

Cost: A hell of a lot less than lining the coast with wind farms.

Failure? That is why we hire the Dutch to teach us how to do it right.

Ok - so please explain this the flooding in 1953, with increased sea levels there are greater risks of storm surges exceeding the capacity of dykes (as in Europe in 1953, or in NO during Katrina). Besides which the Dutch may well be too busy reinforcing their own dykes to worry about anyone elses.

Bangladesh? Their dikes are built with very cheap labor. Or they get on with modernization and move inland. Can't solve everyone's problem. And they will be the last to stop burning fossil fuels so they don't get to claim innocence.

Nice to know you feel that they are as equally guilty as ourselve (in the UK) who produce over 30 times as much carbon per capita. Or the US producing 70 time more per capita.

Nuclear power and desalinization plants solve everything but the Jane Fonda School of Nuclear Physics is against the obvious solution. Shows what happens when melters ally themselves with such experts.

Not likely to happen any time soon, just look at the snails pace the nuclear program is taking in the UK

For India in particular they have already screwed themselves overusing their groundwater.

For the Himalayas, the height determines how cold even in the tropics as Kilimanjaro shows. Its glaciers are going away because of farms replacing jungle on the windward side.

That may have been true upto the 70s, but not now: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retreat_of_glaciers_since_1850#Asia">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retreat...ince_1850#Asia</a>
You are aware the nonsense about the Himalayas losing there glaciers "real soon" has been exposed as another melter fraud are you not?

Please don't be patronising, I've said nothing about timescale

We know how to prevent another glaciation, and it's hard to see what we'd gain from it, then assuming (as I do myself) that we survive as a technological civilisation the next glaciation, should we permit one, will be performance art on a really large scale.

Something to distract people from how horriby wrong the terraforming of Mars went perhaps... <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/cool.gif"/>

LOL, managing climate, isn't really the current goal, merely reversing the symptoms of our own ignorance and greed.

Ah, thank you! I had posted that as a part of another post that was more-or-less off-topic.

No tribble at all! I've experienced some similar issues myself.

We have known the effects of CO2 for 115 years, and suspected them for much longer than that. Note that Arrhenius was shown to have underestimated the magnitude of a doubling increase because he did not consider the knock-on effects.

</quote>
Doesn't surprise me in the least, he was a pretty smart cookie, even if handicapped by his era. If you are implying that you have seen a modern revisit and analysis of Arrhenius' paper, I'd love to take a look at it, got link?

The piece of data that the author fails to consider is how CO2 is changing:

There is probably some wording differences. As warm as is a lot easier to show then warmer than. The former is subject to criticisms that there is overlap in the error bands so its possible it isnt warmer after all.

</quote>
Quite true.
It has actually been several years since I've been through those particular studies, however, so I will try to dig them out and review them this weekend, it is entirely possible that data and analyses from the last few years has already rendered the issue largely moot.

Odd. I always had the idea that CO2 was the only source of carbon for plants. And as it gets warmer plants grow for more months and further north increasing the total quantity of CO2 removed from the atmosphere and oddly things stay in balance with the positive feedback.

</quote>
Atmospheric CO 2 is rising, so there is an im balance.

Warmer plants don't necessarily have longer growing seasons : some plants govern their growth cycles by day-length rather than temperature, and of course "warmer" often means "drier". There's less and less land the further North you go (don't let the Mercator Projection fool you), and in the Southern Hemisphere there's a great deal of ocean in the deep South.

Things are not as simple as you seem to think.

Yet the world is still here. How sad.

</quote>
"Sad" is definitely the word. The world will keep turning whatever happens on the surface (where weather and life happen). That's a tiny part of the world as a whole and has barely any impact on it.
