You're lucky your country is peaceful and everyone has enough to eat, and there isn't a war going on...what about people who are not so lucky? Are you going to turn them away because you can't get a job? I am originally from a place which is not even recognised by the international community, noone even knows it exists, and you won't even find it on most maps. Because of this, it can't even get help from the IMF etc. However, luckily, it's quite peaceful. It hasn't always been like that. But you would probably never survive there. I've been there a few times and it's really hard to live there. Most kids don't even go to school. There aren't enough doctors, and the ones that are there, aren't even properly qualified. I broke my ankle when I was there and I thought it was fixed, only to land in LDN and be told it was still broken! A whole family died when I was there in the summer because they couldn't get enough to eat. It's quite common to see disabled people crawling because they don't have a wheelchair. There's no law and order. People get away with everything cos the police is corrupt. Down South, there's violence and most people have fled the capital. They are also suffering from drought. At least it's peaceful up north where i'm originally from. I'm from a place called Somaliland. My point is, most people would rather be where they are originally from but they want to benefit from things like the education and stable environment...what's so bad about that?

While people are suffering in the world, this country does give aid to countries that are suffering..what happens to it there is uncertain, soetimes the government take it to themselves.
Self sustainability is the key and the way i see it, Britain is not obligated to give millions to other countries when there are problems here that need sorting.
Yes while this is a safe haven at the moment it will not be in a few years time..rival countrymen coming here will fight and kil eachother creating miniature civil wars and destabilising the area.

Yes it's sad that some countries are in trouble but it is not our problem, in 50 years time this country will be white minority and the problems seen in those countries will be seen here, will turn from 1st world to 3rd world...a sorry end to a great nation.

Think 'Escape from New York' and you get the picture.

White English people seem to be the only race on earth that is determined to marginalise itself into extinction by multiculturalism and political correctness. Unfortunately, it is the white, self-hating liberals that are behind these destructive social engineering policies, that will ultimately render our grandchildren and great grandchildren as permanent minorities here, and Britain a multi-racial hell hole.

We are well and truly finished.

Well, surely these white English people can breed with each other. I mean, we as immigrant men cannot do it for them. I suppose we could propose organized rutting sessions for them in local nightclubs and bars to help them boost their numbers so they don't go the way of the dodo. We could incentivize them with some free drinks!

Changes like that advanced by themselves to an extent, not through immigration.

It's ok for things to change naturally but when things are forced upon you it is not good, no one was asked if they wanted immigrants here, there was no vote on it.

There may of been shortages after the war but how does that stand up now, if anything there are too many people and not enough jobs, and yet they still flood in?

I'm white British and i cannot get employed, i don't see it as fair to be honest when my ancestors fought for this country only for me not to be able to get a job in the 21st century because of there being too many people coming in.

Indians have their own homeland they can go back to...we don;t have anywhere to go, this is our home...once it is gone, it is gone.

Actually you have the whole of the European Union. It's there for the taking. If opportunities aren't presenting themselves in Britannia, there are 26 other nations you can stick your fingers in.

Okay, what about the the fact that Britain colonised a lot of countries in the past?
