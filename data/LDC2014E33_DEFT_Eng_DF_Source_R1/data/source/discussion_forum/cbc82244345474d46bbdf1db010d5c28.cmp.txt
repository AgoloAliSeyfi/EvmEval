That fat piece of shit Rush Limbaugh was driven to his knees to apologize to little ole Sandra Fluke. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/clap2.gif"/> She brought him down! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/clap2.gif"/>

YES!

Leave it to a brain-dead pussy lib to equate an apology with weakness

except of course when the dopey-assed President is the one who is constantly engaged in such behavior.

Except of course when a big fat idiot Limbaugh engages in such behavior eh dipshit? Al Franken is right!

Wrong, assbreath.

An apology can occasionally be a good thing. To the extent that Rush was a bit over the line in his attempt to use absurdity to expose absurdity, he is perfectly free to admit his own error of judgement and to apologize to the woman for his intemperate remarks.

But for the current infestation in the Oval Orifice to apologize so often and so ridiculously is another matter entirely. That dope doesn't apologize for his own flawed actions and decisions. No. He apologizes for things on behalf of all of us that do no t even warrant an apology.

Al Franken was not right. He was just a pontificating gasbag liberal whore. Still is.

No. I really am not going to buy Craponite, now.

The dickhead would be you, if you had a dick. But a rancid pussy like you is more of a twat head.

The amount of posts on this thread in such a short amount of time shows one thing for sure. That is Rush Limbaugh stirs the passions on both sides of the isle, which is why he's so successful. Like it or not he is "doing what he was born to do" <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Sandra Fluke is not the first women to kick the shit out of Rush, Hillary did it first.

</quote>

While her husband was getting a blow job in the Oval Office. And she and her daughter were upstairs.

An intern was on her knees sucking him off.

Lets talk truth.
