Has anyone heard about this?

It has been getting a lot of playtime in Milwaukee lately. It is a national campaign that wants people to stop snitchin' on people who commit crimes. It was apparently started by some thug in Baltimore <img src="http://www.andycarvin.com/photos/dvd-1.jpg" alt="http://www.andycarvin.com/photos/dvd-1.jpg"/>

The whole gist is that you can't trust the cops so you shouldn't snitch on people when you are a witness to a crime. Ironically, it also calls for people to snitch on those good citizens that do snitch to the cops.

Anyway, the matter has come to attention in Milwaukee lately in light of two seperate cases. There was a beating of a man, <a href="http://graphics.jsonline.com/graphics/news/img/feb05/beating020605.jpg">Frank Jude</a>, by some off duty police officers in October of 2004. Progress was slow in arressting people for the beating because of a "Code of Silence" among police officers. They are just now in the middle of a trial and even though they do have some witnesses against the police officers there are a lot more that still are not talking.

The sescond case is two missing boys that have gone missing for over two weeks now. Police are convinced that there are people who know something, but no one has come forward with any information. They think that the Stop Snitchin' campaign has something to do with it.

**************************************

Now, in light of the "Code of Silence" and the Frank Jude beating, it is interesting to me that, perhaps, some people do have reason to not trust the police. However, is this any reason to allow crime to continue in your neighborhood? It is two strange counter-productive activites. The cops want people to come forward with info, but they themselves have a code of silence and while people who Stop Snitchin, even in light of not trusting police, are doing nothing but making their own neighborhoods unsafe and keeping two kids from their own neighborhood from being found.

It is a pretty sad statement of the times, IMO, that things have gotten so bad. Cops above the law and criminals glorified over law abiding citizens.

Raising nice, white middle-class kids got a lot more complicated when the Drug Culture Don't Nark ethos came into play.

"Don't Trust Anyone Over Thirty" didn't particularly help matters.

There was a fairly large to-do about a bunch of "Stop snitchin'" T-shirts here in Boston over the winter. The state was claiming that they were being worn by gang members while they sat in the gallery in courtrooms with the intent of intimidating witnesses. The mayor of Boston (Mumbles Menino) tried to have the sale of them banned but that was laughed out of discussion pretty quickly.

From Wikipedia:
"In Boston in December of 2005, faced with a murder rate at 10-year high, mayor Thomas Menino announced that he would begin confiscating Stop Snitchin' shirts from local stores. Though Menino rapidly backed away from mandatory confiscation to endorse voluntary removal of the shirts by store owners, his proposals sparked considerable controversy locally and nationally. Though many saw the initiative as ineffective, counterproductive, or misleading, some community members of high crime inner city areas such as Dorchester defended the move as important to conquering fear on the streets and assisting in criminal prosecutions."

It's worse than sad...it's pathetic. What is even MORE
bothersome to ME PERSONALLY... is the police using known
criminals via threats to get convictions on other people
who they may know nothing about. Cutting them deals. We
need a conviction on this crime, so if you ( you, being 2
time loser criminal Mr. Z) IF you will testify against MR. X
(we don't CARE if you don't know the guy) then you, Mr Z.
all you have to serve is 1 year instead of the 5 years you'll
get otherwise, then out on parole, while Mr. X. (innocent OR
guilty, who cares ) serves 10-15 years for a crime he maybe
didn't even commit. But the police HAVE TO DO SOMETHING,
don't they? When you've got a crime with ZERO suspects,
your boss is breathing down YOUR neck - all you care about
is closing this file. WHY WOULDN'T ANYONE SAY WHATEVER
THEY TELL THEM TO SAY?? In a way, it is THIS kind of
snitchin' that really sucks, in my opinion.
