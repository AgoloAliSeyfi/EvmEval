The Japanese had several negotiated settlements on the table. None of them conformed to the conditions set out and agreed to by the allies.

The surrender offered by Japan prior to the bombs is the same surrender we accepted after the bombs.

This is what I mean. Either this is an accepted, established historical fact or it isn't. We shouldn't be debating WHAT happened. I thought we KNEW what happened. I'm very confused by these different scenarios you guys present.

If we A-Bombed Japan needlessly, it was not ethical. Or was it? Do we agree on that much?

I say no. Even though we benefitted from the object lesson/demonstration of US military power, the use of the A-Bomb -- TWICE -- just to flex our post-war muscles was not ethical, if it was not ALSO necessary to force Japan to surrender.

Personally, I dont think without the dramatic blow of the atomic drops many Japanese military units would have surrendered even if the Emperor had told them to. The military often dictated terms to the government, they had large armies undefeated in China, mass killing civilians every day, they might have just fought on dragging the war out and costing everyone more life, (an invasion of Japan would have cost far more life than the drops on both sides) and allowing the Soviets to expand their sphere of influence in Asia.

Indeed there was a plot to Kamikaze attack the surrender ceremony on the USS Missouri that was stopped by the Emperors son, (John Toland, The Rising Sun) so even after the drops there were hard core elements willing to fight on. The drops (Japan did not know how many more bombs we had) made resistance of any kind almost unthinkable.

Also, how does President Truman tell a parent your son died, even in a war prolonged by days or weeks, and I had a weapon that could have ended the war immediately but did not use it.

He couldnt.

The drops also certainly put a break on Soviet ambitions, they had to think and be cautious about gobbling up territory in the direct post war chaos.

They probably stopped an immediate military conflict with the Soviet Union.

agreed !!!! ests were a million American dead in the invasion. ests were always wrong. probably more like 3 or 4 times that number. this weighed heavily on Trumans mind. drop em.

You are arguing the wrong point. There was no surrender on the table before the A Bombs were dropped. The ONLY thing the Japanese offered was a cease of hostilities and the return of captured territory. They would hand over what ever they still had from after Dec 7 and we would hand over what ever of theirs we had from before Dec 7.

It is a bald faced LIE that the same surrender existed before as after and that we ignored it to bomb them.

My link is to SOURCE documents. We have the actual conversations from the Japanese Government.
