8. I don't know if I can support this line-item veto......

As long as the legislation is clear that the President can veto individual line item(s) to make clear the portions with which he/she disagree, I can support it. But it must be understood that the legislation, so amended, must go back to the House and Senate for approval or for an override of the items so vetoed.

I do not want a unitary executive. Congressional earmarks are a mess but then we the electorate need to do a better job in who we vote for.

But we cannot let the President modify the legislation passed by Congress by striking out items that are from his/her perspective undesirable and then signing the bill into law. The amended legislation must be re-submitted and approved by Congress.

13. I can support a line item veto - as long as we get there via a Constitutional amendment. Doing it

by mere legislation will not hold up in court.

Most governors have this power - along with the requirement to balance the budget. The power applies only to budget line items, not other types of legislation.

9. The next question should be - what is their alterior motive? In this I do not trust them. I hope the

Senate does not pass this. I think they - rethugs are trying to set him up as the person who veotoed it. A political ploy.

they passed line-item when they expected clinton to loose re-election

but didn't the supreme court already rule that a line-item veto was unconstitutional?

19. House wants to have its pork and eat it, too. Here is how the scam will work.

This way, if the House load bills that have to pass---like military funding---with pork(which they have to do, this being an election year) Obama will be the one who is forced to either veto it (alienating voters) or sign it----at which point it becomes his pork and the Congressman who wrote it was just doing his job for his constituents while the GOP House as a whole can claim that it is trying to cut government spending but Obama will not let them.

For instance, military says a certain bomber is unneeded. House member for that district---say, in a purple state like Ohio---wants it built. Obama can either veto the bomber--and lose votes in a purple state. Or he lets the bill through, at which point the House member wins easy re-election.

This strategy depends upon the GOP having lots of SuperPac money to ran wall to wall ads that say something along the lines of "You lost your job at Boeing because Obama cut spending for the ___bomber." In case he does not veto the unnecessary spending, the Super Pacs will run "Obama authorized money for a bomber that the Pentagon said it does not need" in other districts hit hard by the economy.

Solution to this problem: Senate should kill the line item veto now---and then bring it up against next year after Obama is re-elected.

21. There does seem to be a tendency for Congress to reject its powers

We already have "war powers" rules that, while maintaining some tiny fig leaf of retroactive accountability, essentially cede to the President the ability to wage undeclared wars. And now they want to let the President have the power to pick away at spending bills?

Note that this is a one-way power - its use only reduces spending. If you're looking to pull a Grover Norquist, with a RW president in the White House this is pretty much a license to perform the metaphorical drowning Norquist championed.

22. The Legislative Branch abdicating their power.

This is for the new Republican President who can destroy the entire budget without taking down the entire Party. True, he may end up being a 4 year President...but he'll be paid handsomely for doing the wet work on the bottom 90%.
