The only thing you know about Combat Vets is that you are not one.
Everything you say is logical in the delusional world you inhabit.
In the real world it is just the gibberish of an idiot.

I did not insinuate that.

and most vets I've come into contact with who scam the system are all mostly NON combat vets.

be honest. it's all about the money. follow the money
