I understand the gesture in us helping Haiti. Even as a Ron Paul supporter I support helping another country with humanitarian aid in a time like this...but using the RESERVES??

That's not a job of the reserve component. Those men and women are supposed to be the last line of defense here on our shores, and to augment the active duty forces during a time of war or national emergency. National emergency meaning, US national emergency.

This is a misuse of the reserves if you ask me. As if it wasn't bad enough that Bush pretty much back door drafted most of them into Iraq, now Obama is bringing them into Haiti in a clear misuse of their purpose.

I'm already certain the comments on this are going to be pretty evenly divided down partisan lines, too.

I can understand why Obama is doing this. The amount of warlords and gangs down there is preventing aid to getting to the people who need it. Obviously sending some reserves are suppose to combat that.

And I'm just curious Paulie as to what year you're living in? I can understand the use of them in war despite Bush's abuse of that. But the last lines of defense on our shores? Who exactly are you expecting to show up? The British? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_eh.gif"/>

I get your thinking, but I just think it's a bit.. outdated.

Actually, you arrogant bastard, the British are there.

It would be cool if, just once in a while, we recognized that we are not the only damned nation in the world that offers aid and assistance to those in need. Grow the fuck up and stop pretending we are the Supreme Beings.... We are one nation among many helping the Haitians. And that is as it should be.

I am not saying anyone turned down our help, I am saying some countries offered helped during Katrina and were turned down.

</quote>

I'm going to have to see a link to some credible info on that. From what I understand ALL aid offered was accepted despite Bush's taken out of context remark "We can take care of ourselves."

It is wikipedia but it lists what was offered and what was actually taken.

Canada will not attack, and Mexico has already effected la reconquista.

But hey, hey, who really gives a shit if a bunch of Haitians die from neglect after Ma nature thumped 'em.....

As for your snotty remark about partisans, well HELL YES, I am part of the party that will help a little, not kick them while they lay in the street bleeding, and I'm proud to be.

You are impressively stupid, Contessa. You think that only members of the DNC are donating money? How absolutely pathetic.

I think you need some sleep there CG. I was remarking about whether the British were going to show up on our shore. Like you know, during the American Revolution. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_eh.gif"/>

Now I'd like a apology if you don't mind.

Hold your breath while you wait for that, Dog. The Brits, should we ever need them, would show up. The Brits are, without doubt, the best friends we have on this planet and would defend us as we would them.... as we have and as they have ever since they learned not to mess with us.
