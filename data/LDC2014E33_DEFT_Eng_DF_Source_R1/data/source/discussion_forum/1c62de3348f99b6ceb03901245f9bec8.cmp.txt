Some rich people are born rich, but somewhere along their family tree, the money was EARNED, because somebody got the opportunity and took it.

There is no point being bitter at the rich, because it's not their fault you're not rich, it's your fault. "I don't have the same qualifications as him" isn't an excuse, because you had the opportunity. "I know the same people he does" is an excuse, because you can network just as much as then next person.

To problem with this country isn't that the rich are too rich, and the poor are too hard-done-by. The problem with this country is that the poor do nothing but moan about how hard-done-by they are, and refuse to accept that the only barrier between them and their riches is themselves. If the country had less jobsworths, moaners, and anti-rich folk, then most of us could go out into the world and make something of ourselves. Everybody would have an education and a worthwhile job with a relatively high salary, and there wouldn't be such substantial differences between what one guy contributes and what the next guy contributes.

The solution isn't to tax those who have money and give it to the poor. The solution is to stop support the poor and force them into a situation where their only option is to realise their own worth and make the pennies themselves.

And before anybody comes out with the old 'well that's easy for you to say, rich kid' ****, I should let you know that I come from a working class family whose income has never been beyond say 40,000 combined. I didn't have rich, educated or well-networked parents. All I had was myself, and my wits, and that's all I'm ever going to need to get me into the big bucks. Although I am completely discouraged from the big bucks because once the gov't get their share, they're pretty small bucks indeed.

Sure, in theory we all have the same opportunity to succeed, but you only need to look at the figures to realise that this is not the case. It's not coincidence that people from higher-income families get better grades that the lower income ones, or that they are more likely to get a higher paid job themselves.

Not acceptable. I wouldn't work 776 hours a year for my own mum, let alone give to the gov't to waste on their ridiculous policies.

That isn't completely true, because if they didn't work those 776 hours they wouldn't get that 63% figure since it's all relative.

50% is shockingly high but no-one else can afford to pay it, that is the reality of the situation. Those top earners are free to move to Australia or the US where I'm sure the current economic climate will welcome them with open arms. It is mildly heartbreaking to think that somewhere, an individual earning Â£10,000 after tax a month has suddenly being forced to earn Â£9,000. I expect public outcry from the masses, once they find a new low paid job, earn enough to pay rent and get back on the internet again. Perspective: thousands die of starvation everyday.

Millions of people break the familial trend of being a low earner. That's more than enough people than needed to prove that it isn't an unbreakable barrier.
