After all has been said and done, only one person, ebrwon_p, stated unequivocally that he believe that the social and economics gaps between blacks and whites were caused by the history of racial exploitation. Thus, he attributes these gaps to EXTERNAL stimuli. Now, if the cause of something is not EXTERNAL, it can ONLY be INTERNAL. To suggest that Social and economic gaps are INTERNAL to blacks is to suggest that there is a genetic propensity that makes blacks inferior. If I have to say it a million times….I WILL. Those of you who plead the fifth, in order to avoid self-incrimination are hiding something. You ask me how I know what’s in your minds…. well I will tell you. I know what’s in your from the combination of what you say and what you do not say.

The salient point is the binary options of INTERNAL or EXTERNAL, NATURE or NURTURE as to the cause of the social and economic gaps. One does not have to say outright that blacks are inferior. All that they need to say is or imply is that the gaps are not due to known external stimuli such as oppression. By default, when an option is binary and you exclude one, you thus select the other. So the denial that these racial gaps are the product of white discrimination and oppression of white people is by default saying those blacks are inferior.

You all can filibuster and say that I all over the place, ridiculous or any other means of subterfuge and obfuscation the substance and logic of my proposition. Any objective person can see that is what you all are doing. You say that I have know way of knowing what you think, yet, in order to know, I ask a simply question and all of you except of ebrown_p, has decided to filibuster or try to misdirect or other means of aversion that is tantamount to a person pleading the fifth in a trial….in order to prevent self incrimination.

For people who say that I do not know what they think…you sure do a poor job of attempting to demonstrate that I am wrong, by revealing to me what is right.

It is irrelevant that race is not a valid biological phenomenon as long as it is an OBSERVABLE phenomenon. Being an American is not a valid biological phenomenon either, yet, all of you consider yourselves Americans. Race is a social construct, created from observable difference in humans. Most people do not walk around with DNA testing kits to confirm that people they meet are of one race or another. However, human visual sensory receptors can observe differences and characterize those differences as race, or ethnicity or nationality.

I know that race is not a biological reality, because all people actually came from black people in Africa, who migrated and whose phenotypes mutated and adapted to different climatic conditions. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked"/>

Sigh....once again, Noah appears to be talking more than listening, or, let's say, "reading between the lines", a phrase he seems fond of. Fine. I will put my opinion down here as clear as day. I do not believe that Blacks have a genetic propensity to be inferior to whites. By the way, I'm not saying that to try to "not appear to be racist", it happens to be my belief. So there. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes"/> However you interperet it is your business.

Noah having been spoon fed the knowledge by you that all people sprung from Africa, I will now ask that everyone, from this day forward, refer to me as a Caucasian/African American.

By the way have you considered that the first man to spring up in Africa was white, that some migrated to other climates and the ones left in Africa mutated to adapt to the climate and became black?

That’s not the question cavFancier. The question is what accounts for the social and economic gaps between blacks and whites, if not the years of oppression and manipulation upon black peoples, by white peoples? If these gaps are not due to external and social manipulation, what are they due to? Do you agree that the gaps are caused by the history of white social and economic oppression of blacks? Do you think it was something else that causes it? If so, then what? Maybe you just refuse to think about it and thus are ignorant? Is not ignorance often part and parcel to racism?

I wouldn't really know, Noah, seeing as my family were Russian Jews, who had to be smuggled out of Russia due to persecution, with Cossacks plunging bayonets into the haycart my grandfather was riding in. As a child, he watched officials break into his house, and he hid under a table while they got drunk, raped his mother and then shot his father. Somehow, he made it to Canada and made a proper living, despite his history. In conclusion, don't call me ignorant, or racist, and perhaps think about where your racism comes from. You are so narrow-minded in your focus on the differences between Blacks and Whites, you cannot even see that the problems you describe happen all over the world. I am done with this thread.

Yes but Cav, that's just white on white crime and therefore not germaine to the issue, the ONLY issue, that whites are devils and only blacks have ever suffered persecution, right Noah?
