The point is, any economic growth that Obama is inhibiting is miniscule in comparison to other factors. Rather than blaming politicians, we need to blame the state of the market.

Maybe but he has had a hand in the demise of tens of thousands of jobs. Minuscule as that may be, explain that to those who have lost out because of him or his administration.

He also had a hand in creating close to 3 million jobs.

Nonsense. He has invested in mostly failed enterprises. There are fewer jobs available now than there were before he took office. He may have helped "a specific" segment, mostly govt or unions but that's it.

It is slowly recovering on its own despite Obamas policies and business crunching regulations. I am very glad it is coming around but I just wish we could vote Obama out now to expedite the process.

My prediction is that if Obama loses the election growth will double the current snails pace its growing at. In fact I bet upon the news alone that he loses the election we will start seeing firms hire and invest exponentially.

What regulations would those be?

I just gave all my employees a 10% raise and am looking seriously at renting another warehouse.

Nice quote and all...

But the concern was that regulations would curtail the hiring BACK of people already laid off....not result in further lay offs.

Companies had trimmed themselves down to the bare miunimum....no one was really looking at additional layoffs....with the exception of companies going out of business.

You quoted an article that does not at ALL address the issue of regulations costing employers money that they may otherwise invest back into the company so they can bring it back tot he size it was before the recession.

The quote doesn't, but the article itself does. It shows that it is a myth that regulations curtail job growth at any signficant level. This is according to a CONSERVATIVE economist and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

any given regulation...perhaps not..

But knowing that there is a large influx of regulations...and many more to come?

It is that "concern for the unknown" that stymies economic growth.

Knowiung what the regulation is allows one to compensate..and move forward.

Not knowing what is to come and how much it will cost? That si what we are referring to..

And we have a regulation happy administration right now...that you cant deny.

If you read the article, it also says that Republicans try to perpetuate the myth about the uncertainty businesses face due to regulations.

he took my money and gave it to joe so joe can hire tom to do work that gary and his employee Zach would have done but wasnt allowed to do becuase Obama said he wanted Joe to do it with his new employee Tom.

So Gary and Zach lost their jobs and Tom got a job.

Thus why Obama "created" millions of jobs....but there are 1.8 million less people working now.

Are you not aware of how that happened?

It is not a myth.

It is real.

It is basic business logic.

You do not make business moves if you can not accurately forecast.

Sort of business planning 101.

This is what the democrats did to jobs since they took office in January 2007. There is no jobs recovery. Just workers falling of the unemployment rolls. No jobs have been created. Just job loss as far as the eye can see.
