The title says it all really <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/frown.gif"/> My childs class teacher (male) has been finally charged after the police have gathered evidence against him after being accused of 'touching boys privates' in class. It is an awful situation, not just for the children in our class but for the parents too. (This is in primary by the way).

We have had a meeting were we have not been told very much by the authorities, and rumours throughout the school have been rife, mainly by the parents of the children in other classes. Some of the things being said are awful, and actually untrue, eg they are saying he raped the boys in stockroom etc (I know these are untrue as I know the children involved and their parents have said what has happened - however, our class are not gossiping due to the fact that it is so awful). These parents are then saying these things to their children and school environment has been awful for my childs class due to all the things that have been said in the playground.

Anyway, the school have never officially announced/sent letter/reassured parents about what has happened. That I can understand as he wasn't charged until yesterday. Now he has been charged EVERYONE has got something to say about it, mainly untrue gossip that they have heard.

At what stage should our school be doing an official announcement to tell the truth about what is happening to put all these rumours at rest so people know the truth? In my eyes, we should have all had a letter last night after it became official that he has been charged.

Opinions please as I am going into school tonight if we haven't been officially told. I just don't know where the school should be on this, this is not the sort of situation that can be googled for answers.

If I have rambled, let me know and I will try to clarify things as best as I can.

How horrible. I don't think the school is doing itself any favours by not communicating with parents straight away. Obviously all parents are going to be incredibly concerned. You're doing the right thing though by not participating in gossip.

oh no, how awful. i have no idea what the school should do in that situation (and i bet there isn't any policy to cover that). i assume that as he will be assumed innocent until proven guilty, it would be difficult for them to circulate a letter listing the allegations..... hope your little one is coping ok with the stress (although in this situation i bet the kids are much better than the parents).

don't want to read and run but i don't know what to say. i would think that the school has strict guidelines to stick to as to what they can and can't do or say in a situation like this. the only thing i can suggest is that it will be "old news" as such, to the rest of the parents and pupils of other classes after the easter holidays and perhaps things may have calmed down by then.
my son is 7 and i dread to think what i would do in this situation.

how awful for you. its unlikely the school can say very much to be honest because there is clearly an ongoing police investigation. by giving any information, even limited information, this may affect evidence giving and proof for any forthcoming trial, if it gets that far

are you able to talk to any community liaison officers for some reassurance. are you worried about your own children, have they been interviewed?
