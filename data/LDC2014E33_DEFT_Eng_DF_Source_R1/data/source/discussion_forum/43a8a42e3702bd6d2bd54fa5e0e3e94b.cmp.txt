How is it that fair ? Its not. Its genocide towards whites.

As for Japan its one of the most ethnocentric countries in the world (leading to it siding with Hitler in WW2).Its homogeneity, a simple google search would show you that only 1% (roughly) of its population is non-Japanese.

Yet nobody is telling Japan to be flooded with non-asians and "assimilate" with them into one great melting pot. No one is telling Africa to import millions of non-blacks into Africa and "assimilate" them into one great melting point.

Its only white countries and every white country. Full stop.

ps -It want started by the Nazis, the Nazis just used it as one of their principles.

Thats like saying that the idea to start protecting the workers was Karl Marx therefore Labour is a Communist party <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/confused.gif" alt=":confused:"/>

Your post is an epic fail, completely lacking of real world facts.

I do apologies about my mistake. For some reason I managed to confuse Japan with Singapore in my head (d'oh!). Nonetheless, look up Singapore- it could open your eyes. The last I heard- a few years ago mind- about 30%-40% of the population was foreign and Singapore is very wealthy (for its size). Nice place too, so I hear.

By the by- I never said it was started by the Nazis. You've sort of missed the point. Then again, you were probably always going to.

And you can't say that workers rights was an original idea of Karl Marx. After all the work of people like Richard Oastler who helped pass the Factory Act in 1802(?) and Michael Sadler et al. in 1332, pre -date Marx's Manifesto of 1848 by decades. Therefore, Parties (like Labour) are not building on the work of Marx, but instead are building on a long tradition of workers rights in British politics.

Anywho, you haven't denied that the BNP are a Neo-Nazi party. Or did I miss that?

Millions of people are unemployed yet the politicians continue to allow foreign workers to flood into Britain, taking our jobs or claiming benefits, costing you billions of pounds. We live in fear of losing our jobs and politicians are fiddling their expenses and stealing taxpayers' money.

Everyone says there is a "race problem ". The soloution to this "race problem " is going to be solved, when the third world pours only into white countries and into every white country.

Japan is just as first world as Britain. But nobody says there is a "race problem " and to solve it they need to pour millions of third world workers and "assimilate" with them.

Everyone says that the solution for the "race problem" is for millions of non-whites to be brought into white nations and into every white nation. Then to "assimilate " with them.

What if I said there was a "race problem" and this "race problem" would be solved only if hundreds of millions of non-blacks were brought into every black country and only into black nations then "assimilate" with them?

How long would it take anyone to realise, I wouldnt be talking about solving the "race problem " instead Id be trying to solve the black problem.

What kind of black man wouldnt object to this?

But yet if someone like the BNP (in all there faults, which are many) points it out there naziswhowantstokillsixmillionjew s.

Only white countries are affected, only white children suffer only white politicians pursue this. Its genocide.

They say they are "Anti-racist". What they are is "Anti-white",

Anti -racist is a code word for Anti-white.
