Future climate could be hotter than thought - study
Wed Jun 29, 2005

By Patricia Reaney

LONDON (Reuters) - Global temperatures in the future could be much hotter than scientists have predicted if new computer models on climate change are correct, researchers said on Wednesday.

Improvements in air quality will lead to a decrease in aerosols, small particles in the atmosphere that act as a brake on the impact of greenhouse gases. As the effect of aerosols lessen, searing temperatures could follow.

"This new way of integrating the aerosol, greenhouse gas and biosphere effects changes the picture from one where climate change most likely is a fairly tolerable thing to one where there is a fairly high risk of change sooner, and to a higher degree," said Professor Meinrat Andreae.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts a rise in global temperatures from a doubling of carbon dioxide could be in the range of 1.5-4.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. But according to calculations by Andreae and his team, the upper figure could be as high as 6 degrees.

"That's quite a lot," the professor from the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany said in an interview.

Andreae compared greenhouse gases to an accelerator that is speeding up global warming, while the aerosols act as a type of brake.

"The actual true force of the greenhouse gases has been masked by the effects of the aerosols. They put a brake on warming and we don't really know how strong that brake is," said Andreae, who reported his findings in the journal Nature.

Scientists have warned that severe climate change could lead to a rise in sea levels, flooding, severe droughts and the loss of crop and animals species.

Aerosols are small particles and droplets in the air from combustion processes, chemicals and smoke. As regulatory agencies issue new air purity controls, the amount of aerosols will diminish so their cooling effect will be smaller.

Aerosols stay in the atmosphere for about a week but greenhouse gases accumulate over about 50 years. The aerosol brake is going to come off faster than the decrease in greenhouse gases.

"Because one is cumulative and the other is not, the cumulative will always win out in the long run," said Andreae.

He admitted it was a situation of high scientific uncertainty. But if his calculations are correct, climate change in the 21 century could reach the upper extremes or exceed the IPCC estimates.

"Such a degree of climate change is so far outside the range covered by experience and scientific understanding that we cannot with any confidence predict the consequences for the Earth system," Andreae said in the journal.

Policies motivated by political gain will inflict public pain. Why should anyone applaud?
</quote>

This could serve as a blanket condemnation of politicians in general, on the whole gamut of "hot button" topics, not just global warming. Politicians are absolutely necessary to the process of implementing and maintaining the social contract. They are not, however, to be trusted when they feel their public image is in the balance. They bear close watching, constant and vigilant supervision.

The remark about those who "are not hysterical about the global warming panic" was gratuitous and unnecessary--it does nothing to help the debate, and definitely lowers its tone. As for Mr. Samuelson's piece, it is congent in its condemnation of political grandstanding. It is not, however, reliable as scientific review. Although Mr. Samuelson was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 1998 as a commentator, there is no reason to assume that his speculations on the topic carry more weight than the opinions of scientists who study the climate for a living.

You miss the point of the article entirely which is hypocrisy.......hypocrisy on the part of the Europeans for their condemnation of the US and the Bush administration for not joining Kyoto Protocol. The following is a quote from Mr. Samuelson's article which draws attention to the hypocrisy:

<quote>
Europe is the citadel of hypocrisy. Considering Europeans' contempt for the United States and George Bush for not embracing the Kyoto Protocol, you'd expect that they would have made major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions -- the purpose of Kyoto. Well, not exactly. From 1990 (Kyoto's base year for measuring changes) to 2002, global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main greenhouse gas, increased 16.4 percent, reports the International Energy Agency. The U.S. increase was 16.7 percent, and most oof Europe hasn't done much better.

I didn't miss that point, Rayban, i just didn't focus on it the way you have, since i don't automatically dance with glee at a condemnation of European politicians. I consider them neither better nor worse than the gobshites in office here.
