i don't think there are too many people, just too many people to live in the way that we are living. We are still using 19th century models for cities and vehicles but they are out o1f date and yes, we have to many people for that model

to be honest relaxxx i do find it pretty hateful what you implied about culling african babies, call me over sensitive....

So feeding these people now so ten times as many suffer in the future is more kind and humane?

Within the next 50 years or so oil and coal will no longer be a viable source of energy. It will be an economic disaster, beyond that our industrialized agriculture will collapse. Food processing and transportation systems will grind to a halt and our rich countries will suffer mass starvation on a scale never seen before. Feeding a few people now is not going to fix any of this reality. Billions will starve and die. We do poses the ability to control the amount of future suffering by controlling the population today.

Africans and the like would be better served with sterilization/food clinics rather than these religious recruitment/anti birth control/food for Christ propaganda missions that they've been fed the past 40 years.

Maintaining our dependence on fossil fuels for the next 50 years will absolutely create a catastrophe, people have been saying that for decades.

Africans would be better served by the EU removing it's protectionist food tariffs and agricultural subsidies and the rest of the world paying them a fair price for their abundant natural resources rather than cutting deals with the dictators who have kept parts of the continent in chaos since the end of (direct) European occupation after world war II

It isn't just some crazy ironic twist of fate that the majority of the worlds precious metals and stones come from Africa and yet it has so many of the poorest and most violent countries, it's because of that.

I wasn't advocating charity, I think in the two examples I posted, the Somalian famine and the Japanese tsunami/meltdown then absolutely charities are useful because it releases surplus money and resources quickly without conditions and negotiations and so on to respond to an unpredictable natural disaster like crop failures or a massive Tsunami

I also disagree with long term charity work because as you said it can often prolong people's suffering and can sometimes do more harm than good in the long term. As well as what you said about allowing people to have more babies etc some charities are poorly managed and corrupt and money is stolen or wasted by charity owners and local warlords, dictators

It also invites a sense of complacency, people think that they are doing good by throwing a little bit of their spare money at the needy cause of their choice, it is a ridiculous situation. I read a really good article (can't remember where) about the WWF and how they have spent so much of their resources on animals that humans like such as Panda and Rhinos at the expense of many species of birds/insects/rodents etc that aren't as cute but are far more important to their eco-systems.

It's the same thing as how everyone helped Japan but not Somalia because we like it better, we are actually reducing these tragedies into consumer choices which is the same line of thinking that created the mess

I think that your idea is even worse personally, you are talking about it in terms of resources but if you really honestly think about it globally in terms of resources Somalians are probably some of the last people that you would want to cull. I bet that you could get rid of about 1000 middle class Americans in place of the Somalians. These are people who have grown up with nothing and expect nothing, they know how to survive on no food, build houses out of junk etc
If you put them in an abandoned part of Detroit or somewhere I bet there would be enough resources for them just lying about to live better than they do currently at no cost to anyone.

But of course you would never advocate killing 1000 middle class Americans because the world is running out of resources and we just can't afford to keep all of these people alive, because they are humans with hopes and dreams etc completely unlike the people on TV who you lack the imagination to empathise with or even picture as real people. <img src="images/smilies/frown.gif"/>
