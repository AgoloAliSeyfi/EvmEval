As I asked, where's the 6 trillion dollars in that graph?

The Bush admin added 6 trillion dollars onto our national debt. Your graph does not show 6 trillion dollars. Therefore it's a false graph.

You have a crystal ball?

Too bad you didn't have that back in 2004, you could have told your fellow righties not to vote for the debt doubler.

</quote>

and yet you voted for a new "debt doubler".

Many Obama defenders in the comments are claiming that the numbers above do not include spending on Iraq and Afghanistan during the Bush years. They most certainly do

Why didn't we hear about the deficit during the Bush administration?

</quote>

Oh, but we did, ad nauseum.... Every time lib cryasses bitched and moaned about "tax cuts for the rich".

Nevermind that the tax cuts were pretty puny in the grand scheme of things and that the debt had been on track to explode starting in 2003, for about 20 years.

</quote>

Bush's tax cuts for the rich cost us almost a trillion dollars of deficit spending. Bush never paid for those tax cuts.

You think a trillion dollars is puny?

You think it's cryasses bitching and moaning about deficit spending?

What happened to fiscally responsible Republicans?

That's the myth that's been busted. There's been no such Republicans since the Reagan admin.

</quote>

Whoa!!! Wait a minute. It was the Reagan administration that put us on this deficit tract. Reagan? A fiscal conservative?? No frigging way. The deficit numbers say he was a big goverment fiscal liberal.

Obama campaigned on getting rid of wasteful spending.

Then he turned around and signed a nearly $1 trillion un-stimulating succubus package and an omnibus bill with 1,500 pet pork projects in it.

....Pants on fire.....

And if he didn't the right would be blaming the GREAT DEPRESSION on him.

When not waving the flag, Rush and Hannity bemoaned it quite often. Beck mocked and chided Shrub and the congress constantly. Guys like Boortz and Jason Lewis were going absolutely nuts. Then, there were the dems and their compliant media toadies, who pissed and moaned about it in conjunction with the tax cuts for those eeeeeevil "wealthy" people.

Whoever didn't hear about deficits exploding during Chimpy McShrub's eight years had to have been living on a deserted island, with Gilligan and the gang.

Bullshit.

Besides that, your thread premise has more holes in it than Nancy Pelosi's story about the CIA.
