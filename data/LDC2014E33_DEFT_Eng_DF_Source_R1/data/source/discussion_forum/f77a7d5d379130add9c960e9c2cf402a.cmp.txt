These are just musings..but lately there's been alot of frenzied activity from recruiters. And I just went to the office party of my old job and while talking to some of the guys there, many people who were looking for a year or more are getting snapped up.

What's going on?

Well aside from the economy getting better, the Bush tax cuts are set to expire. And there's not much evidence they did anything to help. Employers are sitting on tons and tons of liquidity and playing "shell games" to keep making money..without adding to the overall economy. Given the present anger in the public at large, I have a feeling that to quell some of this..there will be a hiring boom.

I don't think you'll see a "Hiring boom" till after the 2012 elections and that would depend greatly on the outcome.

Do you know something that I dont know about the power of the president??? The only way I see any president influencing the economy in a good way is by representing populist opinion that is based in sound economic theory. Aside from the power to veto and the command of the military the president is not intended to have all that much actual power. He is totally dependent on the congress.

I just want to see your thoughts behind your statement, if you have any. I am also interested to know what candidate you think would best fill the role that you have in mind. Ron Paul is the only one I see with any real plan that is within his power and is totally doable even with the 'do nothing' congress. Returning all the troops home from any country that requests it would be one hell of a start. Thats 200-300 thousand people with good middle class jobs moving into every neighborhood in the country. The border will be secured, which will cause the value of labor to rise. Plundering of the treasury and destruction of the dollar will be halted through the power of the veto. A competing currency will be introduced, although that must go through congress so there is little hope presently. Inflation will continue for years however as the market finds equilibrium from the 97% erosion of dollar values. Most important is the reductions in spending. Consider the 1 trillion in cuts a start. 1 trillion is kinda a magic number, its just enough to start seriously addressing the debt. Overnight confidence the dollar will begin surge. So this is going to effect the market hard and fast in three very good ways. Purchasing power of the general public is going to rise, regulations that prevent competition and expansion of economy will be reduced, and lower taxes.

If we bring all the troops home with no bases overseas, I see a big cut in Military personnel so there won't be that many people spending money here like you say, if we don't maintain a presence overseas we won't need a Military of this size.

I suppose you can call anything a bubble if you like..and point to things to support your point.

My understanding of a "bubble" is a sector that is artificially propped up..despite weak demand. Like the "Housing" bubble at the beginning of the Bush administration.

There is Strong demand for US education. And that's world wide.

Um...what?
Using your definition - there was no housing bubble.
A bubble is a market that is artificially propped up for any reason. Including creating an ARTIFICIAL demand.
Education demand is false. It is not reality. We have eons of kids who couldn't graduate high school getting 4 year loans including room and board. No college in their right mind would accept these kids in the past, and not one bank would give them a loan prior to the government guaranteeing the loan.
Colleges are filled with kids who don't belong there. And the only reason they are there is because of insane student loan practices that are identical in everyway to the insane mortgage loan practices.

Again...I am not just talking about domestic demand. And I am surprised by the "Kids who don't belong there" crapola. Every American kid belongs in college.

In any case..Bush cut taxes..and lowered interest rates to zero. That..and the deregulation brought about by the loss of Glass-Steagall created a plethora of predatory loan companies. That's a real bubble.

"Every kid belongs in college" - that is a huuuge pile of dog poo.
A kid who can't (for whatever reason) hack high school in no way will be successful in higher education. That is really dumb thinking Sallow.

And another thing....the housing bubble started in the Bush admin?
C'mon...I would expect better from you than that. That is T-M and Rdean speak.
