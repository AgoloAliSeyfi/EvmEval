I say both - obviously they are mentally ill to do something like that, however, does that allow them to not be held responsible. I would have to say to murder another human being is mentally ill also, but they still are held responsible for their actions. Under these circumstances I would not think that they should be considered legally insane.

That's a good point - it is both a crime and an aspect of mental illness.

But like the difference between this and chaining a dog up without food or water for three weeks there seems to be a huge difference with intent.

The hoarders seem to see themselves as rescuers of these animals and really think they're helping - they don't think about the real consequences of their actions.

Really, it's like we treat drunk drivers who kill someone different that we treat someone who intentially murders. Again, intent seems to be the deciding factor.

Crime? Mental disorder?

Either way something has to be done or the animals involved will suffer.

Interesting. We had our own local "cat lady" who made the newspaper headlines a couple of decades ago. She lived in a filthy, almost uninhabitable house surrounded by cats, cats, cats. Many people tried to help her, but she made it impossible for anyone to give her effective assistance even in the face of having her home condemned. And that's what eventually happened. Her house was declared a public nuisance and the city tore it down. I'm pretty sure this old lady had more than just a few screws loose.

I saw her many years ago at a local supermarket. She was wearing a drab winter coat and a large colorful scarf around her head with her unkempt gray wig hairs sticking out. She was slumped against a wall and the store personnel had called an ambulance. It was a pathetic sight.

I think it is a kind of depression myself, where one lets go of a lot of effort to keep up with daily life except to 'care' for animals, and then is overwhelmed but sees no way out of it - except that they do, I gather, start again. A kind of compulsion.

Not that I don't want them stopped. Is this a kind of ocd? a pre-alzheimers?
Sigh. There is something to be said for humane institutional care, and I am not talking about the dogs.
Tricky subject, on which I can see several sides.

Illness. J.A. Jance worked with this in one of her (fictional) Joanna Brady novels. She indicates hoarding can almost always be related to childhood sexual abuse. Fiction, it's the only resource I've got on the subject.

They believe it is a form of OCD.

As dragon pointed out, people often line up to adopt these animals when things like this happen and I've often wondered why. The shelters are already full of animals -- if they were wanting a pet why didn't they just go adopt one? Maybe the animal shelter should go rent a house, set it up with some nut and a bunch of cats, go in a week later and "bust" them and thereby reduce the number of pets in the shelter.

The Tufts site has a lot of interesting information including that these hoarders often work in "the helping professions" like nurses, or at a vet's office, that sort of thing -- that unlike Debra's cat lady, you would never know that they had such a compulsion.

It does seem that they have some hole in their life that they fill up with animals. I have always had pets and I really think they are a vital part of my mental health but I can't even imagine what would lead someone to this.
