(Skip down for TLDR but please read all before if you intend neg me)
The NHS is a great system that we should be extremely thankful for and I'm sure we are all extremely grateful for the excellent service it provides. It is the arguably the defining success of post-war Britain. However in recent years we have seen precedent for an unfair system being established; with rising costs of healthcare we are seeing a situation were cover is no longer quite so universal and the one's who are benifiting are the very same people causing the problem.

The issue is with people abusing there bodies in the knowledge that the NHS can catch them, there is much less incentive to show your body, and in turn the system, respect. We are living in a time were people who have no control over there ailments being denied treatment due to budget constraints. Herceptin, a very effective Breast Cancer drug is not universally available due to it's cost, now I am well aware that the media has spun this a bit, as Herceptin is only effective in some cases, but the fact remains it is a postcode lottery were you can be denied life saving treatment due to cost. This is going to be an increasing problem as drugs companies like Astra Zeneca switch from all encompassing mildly effective drugs to drugs that are specific to a small number of cases: thus increasing the cost. The advent of personalised medicine makes the issue crucial. The issue here is the fact the NHS cannot afford these drugs to the innocent as it has taken a stance on preventable illness' such as obesity and smoking/alchohol abuse that just isn't fair.

When you can get a £7000 gastric band or £20,000 gastric bypass on the NHS and the countless thousands that will also be spent on diabetes, physio and knee and hip replacements for free it is plain to see the issue, people's abuse of their bodies are draining the NHS from the people that deserve treatment. There is no disincentive to loose weight when you can eat up to the marker were surgery is freely available. It is easier to gain 3 stone to get a free pass than too lose 7-8 stone to become healthy, the system is ludicrous. Blatant body abuse should not be rewarded. And yes I admit some obesity is aided maybe even caused by genetic reasons but the vast majority is due to idleness, parenting, diet and exercise. You don't accidentally become 25 stone. Personally I believe it is as much a crime to allow your children to become obese from overfeeding then allowing them to become malnourished through under feeding and think the Child Protection Agency should take the same stance, it is just unfair on the Children to be subjected to the far reaching Physical and Mental disadvantages that can result from Childhood Obesity. However I digress and that is another matter. Furthermore the state of A&amp;E on a Friday and Saturday night is disgusting. Now I drink, quite heavily often but I still believe the current system is a joke and unjust. Vital services to accidents are greatly put under strain by the ambulances and stomach pumps etc. put to inebriated people. There needs to be a disincentive such as a £50 surcharge for using A&amp;E under your own fault under Alcohol related causes and I myself would be happy to pay this. Similar things are true for smokers than with obesity but I think you get my issue and this is dragging on.

TLDR: Essentially people who knowingly abuse there body should no longer divert NHS budget from those suffering from ailments beyond there control as it just isn't sustainable and is not fair and gives no incentive to look after your health.

i completely agree, i used to be overweight, guess what i did? i went on a diet!
i have very little sympathy for people who have eaten themselves to that state.
made your bed, lie in it and let the money go to someone who looks after their body but has developed cancer or something through no fault of their own.

Hospitals would be pretty much empty if anyone who had made any contribution to their illness was turfed out.

I can see the benefits of this, but there was a scandal where obese children were taken away from their parents and then it turned out that the kids all had an illness that made them obese. There's a massive risk with taking away children from their families because of the devastating effect it has on families (look up Munchausen by Proxy if you're interested. There was an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA54k6a81-c">interesting documentary</a> about it recently). If you get it wrong then that's 4/5 people's lives ruined.
Also, you're right that how you live as a child has an effect of what you're like as an adult, but I'm not sure if living in care provides a much more stable home. Growing up in care is really, really hard and that itself can cause mental health problems and/or comfort eating.

It seems like you can't win either way. <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/>

You could argue much the same for the child taken from it's parents for malnourishment though surely it affects the lives of all involved, it's the parents fault for subjecting them to child abuse. Obviously the child would ave to be first screened more genetic pre-dispositions and the parents given fair chance to intervene, but I think it would send a clear message that grossly over-feeding your child is abuse. It would be a very difficult and controversial measure to carry out however.

And will watch the documentary later. Cheers for the heads up
