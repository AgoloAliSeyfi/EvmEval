There's no doubt that the administration through the EPA has been hindering the clean-up.

Some are attuned to the possibility of looming catastrophe and know how to head it off. Others are unprepared for risk and even unable to get their priorities straight when risk turns to reality.

The Dutch fall into the first group. Three days after the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico began on April 20, the Netherlands offered the U.S. government ships equipped to handle a major spill, one much larger than the BP spill that then appeared to be underway. "Our system can handle 400 cubic metres per hour," Weird Koops, the chairman of Spill Response Group Holland, told Radio Netherlands Worldwide, giving each Dutch ship more cleanup capacity than all the ships that the U.S. was then employing in the Gulf to combat the spill...

...Why does neither the U.S. government nor U.S. energy companies have on hand the cleanup technology available in Europe? Ironically, the superior European technology runs afoul of U.S. environmental rules. The voracious Dutch vessels, for example, continuously suck up vast quantities of oily water, extract most of the oil and then spit overboard vast quantities of nearly oil-free water. Nearly oil-free isn't good enough for the U.S. regulators, who have a standard of 15 parts per million -- if water isn't at least 99.9985% pure, it may not be returned to the Gulf of Mexico.

When ships in U.S. waters take in oil-contaminated water, they are forced to store it. As U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen, the official in charge of the clean-up operation, explained in a press briefing on June 11, "We have skimmed, to date, about 18 million gallons of oily water--the oil has to be decanted from that [and] our yield is usually somewhere around 10% or 15% on that." In other words, U.S. ships have mostly been removing water from the Gulf, requiring them to make up to 10 times as many trips to storage facilities where they off-load their oil-water mixture, an approach Koops calls "crazy."

Prior to the dutch ships arriving, they sent the sweeper arms to be used on US ships.

And again, Norway has six or seven skimmers in the Gulf. Sounds to me like the Dutch are trying to make money off the tragedy and so are bad mouthing America.

And yet, Dutch ships are there. And Norway's ships are as well and they've been there since the rig blew up.

Amazing that no one ever researches this stuff for themselves and instead depends on rightwing blogs to do their thinking.

Amazing that you actually applaud what has been going on. From the article I posted, you allude to:

<quote>
...In sharp contrast to Dutch preparedness before the fact and the Dutch instinct to dive into action once an emergency becomes apparent, witness the American reaction to the Dutch offer of help. The U.S. government responded with "Thanks but no thanks," remarked Visser, despite BP's desire to bring in the Dutch equipment and despite the no-lose nature of the Dutch offer --the Dutch government offered the use of its equipment at no charge. Even after the U.S. refused, the Dutch kept their vessels on standby, hoping the Americans would come round. By May 5, the U.S. had not come round. To the contrary, the U.S. had also turned down offers of help from 12 other governments, most of them with superior expertise and equipment --unlike the U.S., Europe has robust fleets of Oil Spill Response Vessels that sail circles around their make-shift U.S. counterparts.

That is why the 'ships were there.' Not being used.

On the 29th of JUNE-the headlines were that the US would accept international help:

<a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ifF-1MJID_xuJP1UjukE1SQG66aQD9GL90P80">The Associated Press: US accepts international assistance for Gulf spill</a>

However if one reads, they are not removing the guidelines that would allow the super ships to work. Just more of the hauling water around and getting nothing of substance done...
