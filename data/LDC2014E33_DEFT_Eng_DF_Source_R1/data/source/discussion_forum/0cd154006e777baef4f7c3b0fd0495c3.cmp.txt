JAMES RAY TRIAL
Two witnesses share contrasting recollections of Spiritual Warrior

Dr. Jeanne Armstrong, who on Thursday testified about helping with CPR on Kirby Brown and James Shore, two of the three people who died after the sweat lodge ceremony that was the final event of Ray's 2009 Spiritual Warrior retreat near Sedona, had a somewhat different experience.

On Friday, under cross-examination by defense attorney Truc Do, Armstrong painted a picture of Ray and the seminar with a different brush than had those who found the experience painful and frightening.

Armstrong, a doctor and businesswoman from Indiana, said she looked on the entire seminar as a "challenge to how you think about yourself." She thought the samurai game was "a little silly," but recognized the metaphor it presented, and enjoyed the vision quest for the opportunity to "concentrate on the feelings I was having."

Above all, Armstrong agreed that none of the seminar's events were an opportunity for Ray to exert "mind control" over the participants by conditioning them to blindly follow every command.

...

The day's final witness, Laurie Gennari, had a starkly different take on the events of the week. She had attended several of Ray's previous seminars and said "there was always some little thing I would latch onto and I thought, that was good, maybe he'll get to the better stuff next time."

But from the moment she arrived at the Spiritual Warrior camp, for which she had paid more than $11,000 including room and board, she felt forced, even bullied, into following Ray's orders.

Her take on one of Ray's catch phrases, "play full-on," "mostly meant to me, do as he says."

She said she felt sleep-deprived and usually hungry, and after seeing people "just shot down" for questioning Ray, she decided that she was "pretty much going to keep my head down and stay off the radar by going along and not making waves."

Sweat Lodge Suspect Bullied Participants, Witness Saysâ€Ž

A defense attorney questioned a witness' characterization of a self-help author Tuesday, saying she didn't use as strong words against him in a police interview as she did on the stand.

Laurie Gennari says James Arthur Ray bullied participants and berated those who didn't go along with activities during his weeklong "Spiritual Warrior" seminar in October 2009.

Back in '09 I posted a report that the Lakota Nation was trying to sue JAR for misrepresenting Native American Traditions (See the link to the filing below), but that seems to have dropped out of sight, a quick google search revealing nothing more recent than November '09

I think the Lakotas never expected to win in court..Ray could almost certainly have pleaded he was excercising his First Admendments rights of Freedoms of Religon and Speech to get off until the death occured....but the suit was a way of strongly condeming his action and showing they wanted nothing to do with Ray.
And, anyway, why spend money on a suit when a DA is doing your work for you?

From the Testimony, it is not looking good for Ray....

It is looking bad for Ray right now.

At that point in his testimony, Diskin was fiercely interrupted by defense objections that anticipated the forbidden territory he was about to enter. <a href="http://verdenews.com/main.asp?SectionID=1&amp;SubSectionID=1&amp;ArticleID=41636">source</a>
