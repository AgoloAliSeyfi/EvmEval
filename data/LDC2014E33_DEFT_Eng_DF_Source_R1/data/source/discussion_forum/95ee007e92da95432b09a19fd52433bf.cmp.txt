At the same time the government should not be forcing people to pay for other's people's contraception or forcing insurance companies to offer coverage for contraception if they choose not too

you pay for other peoples health care every time you pay your insurance premiums.... are you protesting your current insurance company as right now?

What does that have to do with the point that the government should not be forcing people to pay for other people's contraception or force insurance companies to provide coverage for contraception?

The Catholic church should concern themselves with trying to keep their house in order.
The pervert priests throughout the existence of the church should be of greater concern than what people think about contraception.

Fortunately the Catholic Church has been losing its power, and because of the pervert priest scandals, its money for some time now.

They are nothing more than hypocrites in a big way.

Hey, pervert priests are no better or worse than the homosexuals. That's for sure. No decent Catholic/Christian should support them. Hopefully both perversions are eradicated.

the government didnt say you directly pay for other peoples health care idiot. the law says the health care providers can not change an extra co-pay or co-insurance for contraception. its not free, its simply included in the cost of your premium.

seeing as how you already pay for other peoples services, why are you not complaining about every other service your health care provider provides for no additional cost?

Have you ever noticed how many kids muslim families have? I have heard that there is a fatwa for each muslim couple to have no less than 5 children. Not sure if that is verifiable on the internet or not, though.

The Catholic Church is opposed to contraception for moral reasons.

Where is the morality in creating a life when food and clean water are rare commodities? Where poverty exists and educational opportunities are non existent?

Where is the morality when disease is spread?

Where is the morality when a women is the victim of domestic violence? When a women is forced to conceive and then trapped as the child become a lever to gain more power and more control?

The Churches take on morality is theirs and theirs alone. As for the birth control issue-

As to the food and water issue, The Catholic Church alone, has done more to get more food and water to starving people then you have or ever will. Its there right to provide there employees what the will.

The point I made regarding food and clean water, as well as disease, was focused specifically on current events in Africa. Not only is the Catholic Church opposed to contraception but the Bush Adminsitrtion was opposed to any efforts to protect pregnanat women (and their unborn children) from disease - water born &amp; AIDS - and poor prenatal nutrition.

I have no doubt the Catholic Church engages in good works and I have no problem with their moral objection to abortion. What I object to, strongly, is stupidity. How is preventing a child's conception a moral issue and how is it any business of the church. The answer is quite simple, more births = more Catholics = more power and money.

First of, dubya got more AIDS money to Africa then Obama. As for the Catholic thing, so ? Its up to the church members weather or not they control there reproduction. Thay just dont fly. They are doing just fine in the membership department.
