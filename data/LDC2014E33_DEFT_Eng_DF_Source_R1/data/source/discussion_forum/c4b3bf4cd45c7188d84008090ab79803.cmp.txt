It was long ago. Maybe it was a sigline picture. But YOU got busted for it. And now you're here feigning outrage at the same sort of thing.

Show an iota of integrity for once in your drab wretched oxygen wasting life.

YOU ARE AN ABSOLUTE LIAR!

SHOW AN IOTA OF HONESTY AND PRODUCE THE EVIDENCE.

You're even changing now where the picture was.

First it's the avatar and now it's in the sigline?

You just made that up to change the subject because you knew the liberals were losing in this thread (as usual) and you had to change the subject.

AND YOU TALKING ABOUT HONESTY AND INTEGRITY is like Bill Clinton lecturing others against lying and adultery.

Losing the thread? I've got you now defending calling women Nazis.

How do feel about calling Cindy Sheehan a prostitute? Calling her a media whore? Do you think that's about the same as what Schultz said?

</quote>

You are the biggest laughable liar.

Show me where I called a woman a nazi?

YOU BROUGHT UP THE SUBJECT OF NAZIS.

I simply addressed it! Now you act like I brought it up? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/new/lmao.gif"/>

First you go FROM TELLING THE THE PREPOSTEROUS LIE that I put Hillary Clinton in cross hairs. A COMPLETE LIE.

Now you are going to the hysterical liberal tacitc of the third degree. Asking question after question THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME, as IF I have to justify myself to YOU! (what a joke!) <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/new/lmao.gif"/>

You are a laughable loon.

I am supposed to answer a bunch of laughable accusations when you haven't even produced the evidence FOR THE FIRST LAUGHABLE ACCUSATION???????

Where is the evidence I ever put Hillary in crosshairs?

Still waiting, you laughable partisan hack!

If they weren't Jews, what were they? Muslims, Christians, Hindi, Atheist? Just because they are Russian immigrants doesn't mean they aren't Jews.

Where does it state they aren't Jews?

And sorry, working outside of the home especially after having children and not being a member of the slum classes is an explicitly liberal philosophy. Are you sure you are a conservative?

YOU DON'T FOLLOW LINKS AND READ!

Ok, and this <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=81429">Arutz Sheva article</a> indicates that he wasn't a Jew. But what about the other neo-Nazis? A non-Jewish IDF soldier who immigrated to Israel from Russia was arrested Wednesday and found to belong to a neo-Nazi organization.

During the subsequent police investigation, suspicions arose that the two may have immigrated to Israel using counterfeit documents. However, due to the complex nature of Israel's Law of Return, it is possible that they arrived legitimately. The law, modeled in response to the Nazi Nuremberg Laws, gives anyone with even one Jewish grandparent the right to receive automatic Israeli citizenship.

The Interior Ministry said it was checking into the matter and will consider revoking the citizenship of the two if they indeed used fraudulent documents, but warned that such action is complicated from a legal perspective.

More on it here:

<a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/81429">Non-Jewish IDF Soldier Found to be Neo-Nazi - Inside Israel - Israel News - Israel National News</a>

What it boils down to is these people immigrated to Israel FOR THE PRECISE reason of causing trouble.

Not everyone that lives is Israel is a Jew, and as the article notes "right of return" means if you have even the slightest heritage, you have the right of return.

Under those auspices HITLER could have immigrated since his grandmother was reputedly a Jew.

Your BS article falls flat.

Don't trust Reuters as a main source for your information.

Obviously, you can't read for comprehension. The links I have posted have nothing to do with the soldier, Dmitri Bogotich, who was being investigated for heroin with the neo-nazi link being overseas and the assailants in my link, Eli Buanitov, part of a group that was discovered in the course of investigations of swastikas and graffiti coupled with assaults in whose very words illuminate the self-hatred, "My grandfather is half Yid, so that this piece of trash won't have ancestors with even the smallest percent of Jewish blood.".

The fact that there are multiple stories with different players kind of refutes the ridiculousness of such a statement, eh?

As an aside, exactly what publications do you believe to be "uncompromised"?

If Reuters, Der Spiegel, Haaretz aren't acceptable?

Nice try BUT THIS IS ABOUT THE "NEO-NAZIS" case in Israel. Try again!

Because "feminazi" WAS part of the criticism and ridicule of the National Organization of Women.

Sluts was used to CHANGE THE SUBJECT and ATTACK ANYONE ACCUSING HORNDOG CLINTON.

Feminazi was not used to change the subject and suggest any woman at NOW for abortion or bringing sexual harrassment cases against school children was a nymphomaniac.

The "Nuts and Sluts" defense was USED PRECISELY to get the heat off Bill "couldn't keep it in his pants" Clinton and make the victims of this horndog seem to be the "guilty party."

So comparing women to Nazis is acceptable if it's on topic??

Are you telling me that ONLY men were Nazis?

In other words, NYcarbineer, you keep repeating the same gibberish. You repeated it again. That's what teapartysamurai is showing you.

The term feminazi is directed at the adherents of feminism, an ideology that is ultimately premised on Marxism. It's not now and never was a derogatory term for women. It applies to male adherents of feminism too, you know, limp-wristed, leftist men.

Now do you intend to go on pretending that the term applies to gender and not ideology?

I can see that it ain't wise to mess with teapartysamurai ; she wields a punishing categorical logic and a wicked right punch line.

But it's all flying right over your head.
