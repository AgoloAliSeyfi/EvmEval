Madeline,

To whatever weight you give USMB-ers, I hope I can add my two cents and experience.

I was a research assistant for 15 months with the <a href="http://american.edu/cas/history/institutes/nuclear-studies.cfm">Nuclear Studies Institute</a>, in my capacity as a researcher compiling documents, quotes, sources, etc. for peer-reviewed articles and a book, I pored over several hundred and probably thousands of official documents from the time the bomb was dropped. I think it's fair to call myself an expert on the subject and I was mentored by one of the nation's foremost scholars on the subject..

Yes, Madeline, I suggest you actually go to the sources of these claims and see what the articles REALLY say, rather than relying on half-quotes.

</quote>

I suggest she do that too. That's why I not only provided her with links, but with several scholarly book recommendations that are far more comprehensive, thorough, well-researched and sourced than any website would be. If she's genuinely curious about this, it's a subject I'm fascinated by and spent a significant portion of my life researching, so I'm trying to make finding the knowledge for herself as easy as possible.

Also, you'll notice I cited all of my quotes and they can be easily verified. I see that CurveLight, knowingly or not, posted a half-quote that gave an inaccurate impression, but I am not him and I have not done the same so don't attempt to smear me by association unless you have some legitimate issue with any of the accurate and contextualized quotes.

</quote>

I purposefully cited half of Leahy's quote because his prediction the bombs would not detonate have no bearing on his position they were not necessary. There was no risk of a failed detonation whether the bombs worked or not. If they didn't go off they would have simply looked like conventional duds. It's not like the Japanese military would have said "Look! The nukes didn't go off!"

Although any poor sucker who would have opened a dud would not exactly be radiating with joy.......

First thing. The Atomic Bombs were not ready until Summer 1945. Germany surrendered in April. We had no reason to drop said bombs on Germany.

The reality is that it took BOTH bombs to get the Emperor of Japan to over ride his Army Controlled Government and order an immediate surrender. With those bombs we would have starved Japan through the winter killing untold thousands followed by an Invasion of a Home Island which would have seen MILLIONS of dead Japanese civilians and soldiers.

Japan was teaching her civilians to arm themselves with Bamboo spears and human wave charge any invasion. The continued invasion of Japan could have seen the potential elimination of the Japanese race.

The lie that Japan was ready to surrender is revisionist history. Japan under the Army had no intention of surrender. What they "offered" through the Soviet Union was a cease fire with Japan keeping everything she still possessed and the return of Japanese home possessions like Saipan and Okinawa. Japan was offering to let us just stop attacking them. They would retain all of their Chinese, Korean and other possessions and we would return their home island captures.

Here is a link to SOURCE documents verifying that Japan was NOT offering a meaningful surrender, that even after two atomic Bombs the Army controlled government refused to surrender, that the Emperor failed to act until after the second atomic bomb and that the Army attempted a Coup to prevent the Emperor from surrendering.

The atomic bombs were necessary unless one thinks we should have just let Japan keep everything from before the war and not disarm. They SAVED millions of lives.

From everything I've read, and talking with people at my Grandpop's lodge, this is the version I believe. I think the Truman Administration did the right thing to save American lives as terrifying as it was.

I cannot get any pro-bomb person to answer a couple of questions so maybe you can.

If we dropped the bombs to force an unconditional surrender, then why is it the US changed its surrender terms instead of Japan?

Do you realize that after the bombs were dropped it was not Japan who changed their conditions for surrender but the US?

If it was worth nuking two civilian populations to try and force an unconditional surrender then why did we give up? The nukes didn't change Japan's terms for surrender so why didn't we invade? Why didn't we continue firebombing, blockades and air raids?

NO unconditional Surrender allowed.

</quote>

Do you think you're somehow disproving, or even arguing, with what I said?

They were never willing to surrender unconditionally, I made that quite clear.

They were however willing to surrender with the sole condition that the Emperor retain his throne, we refused that sole condition, dropped two atomic bombs on their cities, and then allowed the Emperor to retain his throne anyway.

</quote>

The Emperor only agreed to the provision of a a surrender with him in control AFTER the first bomb, NOT before. There is NO surrender agreement prior to the first atomic blast. All they offered was to cease hostilities and return to the Dec 1941 lines.

Even after the first blast the Emperor did not FORCE the Army to give up. He told them to continue to work for better terms. they offered 4 terms which were rejected.

After the second Bomb and a Soviet Invasion the Army STILL refused to surrender. It took the Emperor to intervene and even then the Army tried a Coup to stop him

</quote>

Show us in the Potsdam Declaration where the Emperor's disposition is stated upon agreement of surrender.
