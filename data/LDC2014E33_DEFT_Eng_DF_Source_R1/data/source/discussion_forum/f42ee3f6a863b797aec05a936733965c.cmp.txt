This question may have been done before, but I can't remember, so here it is (possibly again) <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"/>

I'm curious to see how far back people can remember, and to what degree of accuracy. I'll give an example:

I remember events back to when I was two years old, but after speaking to my relatives who were there at the time, I find that the images and events which I remember are only only partially correct.

My sister is two years younger than I am, and I remember the day she came home from the hospital. We were living in the house in New Jersay, and Mom and I were standing in the hallway watching as a car drove up and my grandmother got out carrying my new sister. I jumped up and down and asked mom if I could hold the baby, and my mom said ok, but she told me to sit on the couch first (but I was too excited to sit, so I jumped up and down on the couch instead <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"/> )

I can see these events in my mind, but they are not all correct.

For one thing, we were living in Alabama at the time, so the house and hallway were totally wrong. And of course, it wasn't my grandmother who drove home with my sister, it was my mother. And the lady in the hallway with me was my grandmother, not my mother. However, grandmom says that we did stand in the hallway and watch the car drive up, and I did ask to hold her, and she did send me to the couch, and I did jump around rather than sit. And it was the old white couch we had back when I was two, with the texture I remember, and which we threw away before I was three.

We know the date this happened, because we know when Mom and Sister came home from the hospital, so I was two years and two months old at the time. Forty years later, I find in hindsight, that my memory is clear, but inaccurate.

I cannot remember any events before this time.

Does anyone else's memory go back before two years and two months? And if so, do you have any measure of how accurate those memories are?

good one...
I am not sure (will check with father tomorrow if he remembers) but I believe that my first memory dates from approx. same time as yours.
I was around two years old when they woke me up late at night, and mom took me in her arms and we went to living room where was my dad with blue bag in which was puppy...my first dog. I remember all of furniture details, but that is not so important, because I lived in this house until I was 6, so this memories may be mixed with memories from later...I remember however how my dad was dressed (can't remember about mom, I am just guessing, and probably it's a good guess, but still just a guess), I remember that I was sitting on a couch and I remember that my dad asked me what name we will give to dog...
I also have memory (but this one is not that clear) about my dad and me walking on completely frozen river that is near that house - that happened last time January 1977th (last time that river was so frozen that you could walk on it), when I was 23 months old. But this memory is blurred, I can't recall any details, I just remember that I was with my dad, and that river was frozen and that there were lot of people

I was in the high chair so I was maybe 2 or 3, and eating Life cereal with milk (my mother was feeding me). I finished the cereal but not the milk so she poured it into a red plastic cup and gave it to me to drink. I saw the bits of cereal floating around in the milk and threw the glass across the kitchen.

I also remember the carpeting in that house, as light blue, though my mother says it was light green. We moved when I was 5.

This question was posted on Abuzz years ago.

I remember walking around the corner of my house, past a running air conditioning unit, in the heat of the summer.

Same memory I wrote about on Abuzz. I remember clothes. Two corduroy jumpsuits, one pink, one blue, that snapped up the inner legs, so I must have still been in diapers.

Lots of "memories" we think we have from a long time ago are very inaccurate - I was doing some research into this recently and found it fascinating.

Anyway - the earliest memory I THINK I have was when I was still in nappies.

It is dark - and I am lying on the floor - living room, I think - and I am terrified - I can see a huge, strange, person hulking above me (details very unclear - blurred - by tears?) - she is trying to change my nappy, and I am TERRIFIED!!!! Screaming and such - thankfully, my familiar sister intervenes - I think my eyes are closed by then, she is just a familiar presence, and I calm down.

I am sure it was our very normal sized baby sitter, Miss Martyn, from a 2 year old perspective. Maybe the first time she came, and I was asleep when she arrived?

Things are so BIG and strange. It makes me think it may be a true memory - it is so unlike older memories - very accurate from a wee person's perspective.
