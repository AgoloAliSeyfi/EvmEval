I'm struggling to see how a crime has been committed.

The OP signed a document and then signed it again, as the witness.

Mother-in-law is the beneficiary. She presented the form to her solicitor (presumably), who in turn acted for her in obtaining a mortgage for the property. Or something like that.

It sounds to me like the OP is going to be treated like a witness, rather than an offender. By explaining exactly what happened, the circumstances in which he signed the form and the subsequent threats from MIL, the police will be alerted to a possible fraud. The solicitor won't come out of this smelling of roses either.

If he is being treated like a witness, then he will be taken to an interview room, questioned and asked to make a (witness) statement.

If he is being treated as a suspect then he will be arrested at the station and taken to a Custody suite.

If the latter happens, then here's my advice:

Once inside the custody suite, you will be asked whether you want a solicitor.
Say 'yes'.
The sergeant will ask you whether you suffer from any health or mental problems.
Say 'yes' again. If you take any medication - take it with you to the police station and show it to the officer.
The sergeant may ask whether you would like an 'appropriate adult' to be with you while you are interviewed.
Say 'yes' again.
The sergeant may well ask you if you want to see a doctor.
Say 'yes'. The doctor will examine you and see whether you are fit for interview.

Tell the duty solicitor your story and take advice on whether to answer questions or not. Personally, and with only a minscule understanding of the case and your part in it, I would advise you to be truthful and tell the police everything now. They'll only re-arrest you at a later stage, when they've interviewed MIL and the solicitor.

You'll be given a piece of paper when you leave. It's important. Get your solicitor to explain it.

If you are a witness, you won't get any paperwork and you won't have a solicitor, so make sure you fully understand what the process was (get the officers to explain it to you!). Give us an update, please.

Just a quick update DD had a call from the police this morning they have a bigger case on at the moment. The police officer will be chatting to the DCI sometime today if he gets time and then to the custody officer to arrange a time for DH to be arrested. The police offer called him stupid but thats the way it goes. He should have not done it and my mum should have not made him do it.

As I read it, M-i-L lives in a valuable property which does not belong entirely to her. Perhaps she's a second wife or widow who has a right to live there for the rest of her own life but owns only half in her own name. Let's assume that the co-owner of the mother in law's property is named Rumpelstiltskin. He has rights in the property, presumably totalling many thousands of pounds. M-i-l can't do anything to or with that property without Rumpelstiltskin's knowledge and consent.

M-i-L is in financial trouble. She wants to raise a loan or mortgage of some sort (OP refers to money lenders) but cannot do so without Rumpelstiltskin's written agreement and he is unlikely (at the very least, I would think) to agree.

So M-i-L plots to get OP to sign the legal documents, pretending to be Rumpelstiltskin, so that a presumably large sum of money goes into her account.. and all totally behind the back of the rightful co-owner.

Rumpelstiltskin's solicitor gets wind of this (perhaps via Land Registry?) and starts to ask questions. OP is now panicked at what he has done. M-i-L makes it clear that she'll do anything to protect her own safety. Daughter, son in law and grandchildren can go to hell!

In the interval, Rumpelstiltskin's solicitor informs the Police that he suspects a crime - in this case, blatant fraud perpetrated against his client as well as the loan/mortgage company.

Poor unknowing Rumpelstiltskin is now in the unfortunate position that (if I'm right in my assessment) the monies taken out amount to a kind of negative equity for his proportion of the property. Unless he can have the M-i-L's bank accounts and assets seized, I'm not sure how he can recover the value of his share of the property.

There is only one way out of this as far as I can see. OP, with the support of what appears to be a loyal wife, confesses his own part in the conspiracy to defraud and takes his punishment on the chin. Me? I'd take the punishment willingly if it means I can take down this disgraceful mother/grandmother with me! <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/angry-smiley-030.gif"/>

How am I doing so far, OP?

Exactly what has happened DH feels so bad at what has happened that he has confessed to the police and as previous post the police know what has happened and he will be arrested on fraud crimes (However i am not sure on what crimes at the moment). He knows what is coming to him and i know that he does not like my mother therefore all will come out when it goes to court. as for going to hell DH is not allowed to speak or be near my mum so as far as he is concerned she can go to hell
