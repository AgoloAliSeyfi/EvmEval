Well?

Anyone?

Would anyone who disapproved of the rally like to offer an alternative?

If not, I suppose we are to assume that there isn't any. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_whistle.gif"/>

if this rally proves anything of the left it is their hatred of freedom. it really is that simple.

This rally wasn't about left or right.

As I've said several times, if it were anybody but Glenn Beck leading the charge, I'd agree wholeheartedly. But he has a clear agenda. End of story.

He does have a clear agenda. Restore Faith, Hope, Charity, Honor, and a love for the Constitution.

What's so bad about that?

Restoring Honor means? It suggests that honor was taken, if honor can be taken, who took it?

Seems to me, and I only watched a short time, this was another in a series of events where uber-patriotism and God are used to appeal to the emotions of the people. It reminded me of this well known remark, ' When fascism comes to America it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.

Of course I'm not suggesting Beck or those who organized today's event or past 'tea parties' are fascists, but they do put on events based solely on emotion which appeal to those who seem to want to hear simple solutions to complex and myraid problems.

Though the stage included a bit of diversity, when the camera pans the crowd there were only white people in view, and most appeared well fed and dressed in middle-class attire.

based on that statement, would you say george washington was a fascist?

</quote>

Glen Beck is no George Wasington. BTW, are you dishonest, or have reading comprehension problems?
"Of course I'm not suggesting Beck or those who organized today's event or past 'tea parties' are fascists..."

</quote>

Did anyone claim Beck was George Washington?

I think maybe you should ask yourself those very same questions.

And what credentials does Glenn Beck possess to make him an authority on what constitutes honor?

Good question, try asking one of the 100,000+ that showed up.

<a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0810/41553.html">Glenn Beck rally drew a crowd. But how big? - Scott Wong - POLITICO.com</a>

How many people jammed the National Mall Saturday to take part in Glenn Beck's "Restoring Honor" rally?

Tens of thousands? Certainly. One hundred thousand? Perhaps. Half a million? No one can really say for sure.

Crowds packed the area around the Reflecting Pool, standing shoulder-to-shoulder under the canopy of trees, as they strained to see the half a dozen big-screen monitors near the Lincoln Memorial. Families huddled around the World War II Memorial fountain, dipping their feet in the water to stay cool under the August sun. And they laid out camping chairs and sun umbrellas, filling the large grassy area between the memorial and the Washington Monument.

Organizers pulled event permits for up to 300,000 people, and expected at least 100,000 to show up.

Beck said he had heard the crowd was between 300,000 and 500,000, "and if that's coming from the media, God only knows."

But the Associated Press said tens of thousands of people participated in the rally.

Authorities wouldn't say how many people turned out. The National Park Service stopped estimating crowds in 1997 after it was accused of underestimating the size of the Million Man March two years earlier.
Sgt. David Schlosser, spokesman for the U.S. Park Police, said it's extremely difficult to estimate crowds of this magnitude, given their fluctuations throughout the day and the fact that some are simply tourists.
"We are not the event organizers. We are merely the police officers for the event," Schlosser said. "It's a better policy not to provide crowd estimates. It doesn't offer us anything from an operational standpoint."

The size of Saturday's crowd does, however, matter to Beck and other organizers who say the turnout is indicative of American's growing anger with the direction the country is headed under President Barack Obama and a Democrat-led Congress.

Matt Michaels, 32, of West Minister, Md., joined the thousands that carved out a small space around the Reflecting Pool.

"It was people from all over the country," he said. "It was tight, compact, but it goes to show we're uniting across all races, all ideas."

More than 100 members of the Kentucky 9/12 Project were on hand, some who had attended last year's tea party rally on the mall on Sept. 12.
"We've decided to start taking responsibility for ourselves rather than wait for our representatives," said member Anne Nagy, 51, of Danville, Ky. "Its not about parties. It's about honor."

yes, and according to the left assed press about ten people showed up two years ago for the tea party rally, so we're really going to rely on your sources ain't we? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>
