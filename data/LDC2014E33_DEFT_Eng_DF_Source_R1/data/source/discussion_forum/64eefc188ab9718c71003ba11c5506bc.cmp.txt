You sure didn't join up for the good food and no 18 year old kid worries about a medical plan. Maybe you forgot about patriotism. Personally I'm sick of Veterans whining about lost benefits. Get a freaking job that furnishes benefits like I did.

That's kinda the point of this topic. If the military gets the same benefits for less pay than a civilian, with the chance of being shot at and multiple long tours overseas in some real shitholes, there is no real reason to join the military.

This will affect our military readiness.

I can't tell you how many times I would fantasize about a Pizza Hut pizza or a Whopper with cheese. I would also fantasize about hitting some blacktop back in the states and just doing some night driving. Just moving on down the highway on a smooth road. Or sleeping on a real bed. Or taking a shower, alone. Without shower shoes. With clean water. And no stench in the air. In silence. With as much hot water as I can stand.

People have no clue how good we have it here.

Or showering without hearing someone taking a crap. Or trying to hurry to the shower tent that doesn't have the mold. Or walking out of the shower into the sandstorm asking yourself why didnt I just use the baby wipes. And my personal favorite being home and not having to walk around with the coon eyes from sitting in a turret with G14 classified goggles on all day.

Man when I was deployed I missed being able to have a beer, and have sex with a woman without risking Non Judicial punishment.

U can get a non alcoholic beer and host nation chick. I mean I don't advise pursuing either of the two but they are options none the less.

One more thing. My Congressman busted some serious nuts.

And he's a Democrat. I don't like any of his political ideas, but this guy really worked over the Tricare system to get that cognitive therapy turned on.

I actually got a phone call from a Colonel on the medical review board to offer me his deepest and sincerest apologies after my Congressman get involved.

It was sweeeeeeeeet!

Your Congressman has to respond to a flare sent up by a vet. They all have military affairs staff.

Just so you know.

The only way to protect veteran's EARNED benefits is to send Obama packing in November. Every vet group I am affilitated with plans to do this. It's a MAJOR hot topic and he's not fooling any of us into believing he gives a shit about veterans or those who are currently on active duty + their families.

Hey fuckstick: what does this have to do with Obama? The Republicans control the House, where spending originates.

Instead of trying to pin everything on the Black man in the White House, how about finding out who in Congress has advanced bills that cut Veteran's benefits?

Or is that too much effort, you lazy punk?

Well I deployed to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, they had non alcoholic beers but we were not allowed to have sex, with anyone, at all. Even the married Air Force couples that were deployed together were not allowed to fuck.
