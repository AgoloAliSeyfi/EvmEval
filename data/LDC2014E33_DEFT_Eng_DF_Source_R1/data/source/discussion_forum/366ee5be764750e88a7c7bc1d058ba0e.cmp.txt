Sure, if you like to call something caused out of negligence an "accident" - whatever. I know I'm just a mere human, I have no right to question a corporation.

HOW DOES THAT CHANGE THE FACT I'M BREATHING OIL FUMES RIGHT NOW?

I do think they should pay to clean up the oil spill, and fix whatever went wrong.

</quote>

Nevermind the fact they are putting people out of business for years to come, I guess they shouldn't have to pay for that - those people can just go fuck themselves, right? "Hey Forest Gump, FUCK YOU!" is what BP should tell them?

Always the victim.

Oh, the drama.

I don't know how to go about seeking vengence on BP for desecration of the Gulf. I am beside myself. My best friend #3 was going to St. George Island with her family for Mother's Day this weekend. But they will probably cancel because the oil slick will have reached those sugary sand beaches by then.

About a month after the ocean's shores have been befouled, the inland waterways will begin showing the devasation. The Wakulla River, where my kidlet taught me to canoe. The St. John's River, where we hung out in a biker bar in St. Mark's on Fridays after work, eating broiled shrimp and drinking cheap beer, just watching the Earth do it's thing.

Eventually the oil will travel the underground and above-ground aquifer to every Florida body of water, including the beleagered Everglades...a natural phenomena unparrelled on Planet Earth and precious not only to Florida, but to the entire Planet for the role it plays in our wildlife, ecosystem and so on.

Death would not be too severe a punishment for BP's CEO, as I see it.

Don't buy BP gasoline!

Try to boycott, especially if you are purchasing large quantities for a commercial trucking, farming or airline business.

I welcome any additional ideas on how to afflict BP.

I am just heart broken. I cannot tell you what this preventable insult to the Earth will be like for all of Florida, and beyond.

Death? Maybe too much. I'd be satisfied with making him bath in oil for a few months - and taking everything he owns.

So when 747 nosedives into the ground (assuming the pilot survives), he's to be drawn and quartered?

</quote>

I'm no expert but I'd bet the results of the nose dive will have accomplished your desired dismemberment.

If a BP Station has the cheapest gas, that's where I'll be filling up.

</quote>

There isn't one locally, so it is of no consequence for me.
If the price is the lowest, that's were I fill up.
If it ain't, I will institute a momentary boycott and go where the price is lowest.

I can see than hundreds of thousands of people having to breathe oil fumes is just a joke to you. You probably think most all human suffering is just some big joke - all of it, that is, except when it happens to you.

GUESS WHAT DIPSHIT - OIL FUMES ARE NO LAUGHING MATTER.
