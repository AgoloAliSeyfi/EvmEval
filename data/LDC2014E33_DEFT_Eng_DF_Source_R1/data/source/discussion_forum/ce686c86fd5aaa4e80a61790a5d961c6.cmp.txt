It's important to note that Buffet has significant investments in Life Insurance Companies.

The Life Insurance Lobby is one of the strongest supporters of the Estate Tax. One way to get around the Estate Tax is to buy very expensive life insurance coverage.

Bill Gates jr and sr. also support the estate tax, are you gonna tell me that they have a vested interest in life insurance too?

Until you people look at the loopholes for Gate's and Buffet's estates, I certainly wouldn't be using them as stellar examples to prove your points. The relatives will be well taken care of through the Trusts. Not much will be able to be taxed, because of the charities within the Trusts.
I have to laugh at some of you for even bringing these fine examples of capitalism to the forefront.

actually your an idiot. Most of Buffetts and Gates estates are actually being donated to charity. Buffets business will be taken over by his children. but they will only be assuming leadership, since the majority of Buffetts wealth is in his shares of Berkshire Hathaway, it will be transfered to the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation over the next few years in the form of stock. Which will then be sold on the open market and the proceeds will benefit the charity.

Buffett wants his children to earn their own money like he did, not get it free. nice try with him simply giving his money to his heirs tax free.

You have to look a little closer than that. No, I'm not an idiot....the keyword is charities, and who are on the boards of those charities. But, keep trying....

Yep all income should be taxed exactly the same no matter how you got it.

</quote>

Even if it's already been taxed once? Tell me, do you pay taxes at the grocery store on the food you buy and then pay taxes again when you eat it?

How many bites of the apple does the gubmint get?

</quote>

The answer is....NO. You don't pay again for it when you eat it.

But I'm sure if they could figure out a way they would try to tax what we put in our mouths when we put it in our mouths and then again when it comes out of our asses.

Not everyone is as rich or as selfish towards his kids as Bill Gates is.
