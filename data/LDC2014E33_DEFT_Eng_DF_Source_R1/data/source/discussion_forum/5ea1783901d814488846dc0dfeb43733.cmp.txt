Slimey bastard can lie about his past all he wants.

There are too many people who are not going to let Paul get away with the lies (like me!)

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7PYmCZEJqQ">Classic Ron Paul - Interview at the Libertarian Party National Convention - YouTube</a>

This is exactly what I told you. Paul left for the libertarian party and only returned to the Republican party when he discovered he couldn't win elections in the libertarian party.

NOW, Paul wants to claim HE's the "Reagan" candidate!

Both Gingrich and Paul have made this claim and both of them have a record of bad mouthing Reagan when they thought it advataged their political career.

Talking out of both sides of your mouth may work for liberals. Conservatives (like me) have a much longer memory.

Reagan never blamed America, but had faith in America.

Paul has some serious explaining to do.

Proof? link? Anything??? I'm not saying you're wrong, but surely you have some evidence to back your assertion.

Explain what? If he gets the nomination, you close ranks and support him because he's the choice of Team Red, and literally Satan himself is better than anyone that could possibly be nominated by Team Blue.

I mean, you wouldn't want someone to think you're not a party man... would you??
