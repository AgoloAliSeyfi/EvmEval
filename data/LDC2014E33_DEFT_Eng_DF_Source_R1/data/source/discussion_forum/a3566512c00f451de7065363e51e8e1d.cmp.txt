You guys really think we are an honorable nation anymore?

Take a look at any headline.

Corruption, crime is rampant.

Our economy is in the middle of a depression because people had no honor or integrity in their business dealings.

Look at the past 4 administrations. You honestly think we've had honorable people in power most of those times?

We get corrupt politicians because the people are themselves corrupt. We need to begin empowering people with integrity and truth again. Because we are going to be going through some pain soon. It's inevitable. The only question is whether we are prepared for it or not.

Does anyone honestly think we can continue spending carelessly with no consequences? Doesn't matter whether it's personal or public spending, eventually the bill comes in and if we aren't ready, we are screwed.

Does anyone honestly think we can tolerate corruption in our politicians and bueaucracies and there are no consequences?

You think we can have a strong economy when we can't trust one another?

Do you think we can be world leaders when others can't trust us?

You think our children will grow to be honorable people if they see us being dishonest and easily corrupted?

Every single individual needs to look at their lives. They need to root out all corruption. They need to be honest in word and deed. They need to do what they say they will do. They need to do what it takes to meet their responsibilities to take care of themselves, their families, and then do what they can for the community at large.

I am the first one to acknowledge that I need work. Can you honestly say you don't?

And don't confuse honor with pride.

And Glenn Beck has the way to improve upon all those evils? Uh huh... He perpetuates hatred, period. If it were all about losing our "honor" over the past several years, why wasn't someone who exemplifies that "honor" asked to speak? Why not someone like General Patreaus or Rick Warren? Or both? I know I would love to hear speeches from them about restoring honor and dignity, and September 12th would have been the perfect day. But Sarah Palin? Puleeze. This whole rally is political in nature, just shy of the midterm election 2 months away. It's a fucking smokescreen to rev up the tribe and get radicals elected.

another dumbass. i love it. where was anything political mentioned at the rally? Ive watched the whole thing and all that is spoken about is love for the founding principles, love for our veterans, the honorable gift of charity, and sacrafice that made america free. If you take issue with that, then you are the one who is full of hatred. get a clue.

It is obvious to any thinking American that we have lost the path of honor.. It does not NEED pointed out..especially from the likes of Beck. His pathetic rally doesn't restore anything. It is a rally for the simple minded. Talking "honor" is bullshit. You either have it or you don't. It does inspire disgust to see a Rupert Murdoch lackey speak of honor.

Who would you prefer?

Well?

Anyone?

Would anyone who disapproved of the rally like to offer an alternative?

If not, I suppose we are to assume that there isn't any. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_whistle.gif"/>
