What was the alternative?

In 2001 was William Hague offering austerity measures and plans to run a fiscal surplus?
No he was offering increased spending on defence, increased spending on law and order, and putting in all the usual guarantees of "we will NOT reduce spending from Labour's levels on health, we will NOT reduce spending on education" and so on.

The main Conservative policies were anti EU and anti immigration.

In 2005 more or less similar. Michael Howard talked about targeting a spending reduction of £6bn. So lets say he got in in 2005, and we'd had 3 years of £6bn less spending. Look at the overall debt levels, would that have balanced the books. Would it heck.

The Tories never once during the period up till the financial crisis, talked about tightening regulation on the banks or austerity measures. It is all stuff they have talked about after it happened.

It's just the same as Labour did to John Major, Neil Kinnock supported the UK joining the ERM, when we joined Labour said it was about time, in the 1992 election Labour had a policy of supporting ERM membership. Then it went tits up and Labour spent the rest of that parliament castigating John Major for his shambolic policy of being in the ERM.

As recently as 2006 you had George Osborne basing the Tory economic policy on the Irish model, because they were the 'Celtic Tiger' who had achieved fantastic growth through slashing corporation tax and investing more in public services at the same time (the fact that it was financed on borrowing didn't matter because they were as convinced as Osborne, who was as convinced as Brown, that the era of boom and bust was over).

So don't kid yourselves that there would have been anything different had the Tories won in 2001 or 2005. In fact just look at the USA, you had a neoliberal Republican government in office from 2000 to 2008 who left the US saddled with a huge fiscal deficit, despite the fact they had inherited a surplus from Clinton! Bush wasn't a socialist, he just bought the same myth that Labour did here, and the Conservatives did here, that the good times were going on for so long that you could have a period of borrowing and it would easily be wiped out through growth.

When people say that this financial crisis was caused by socialism and welfare spending, they need to look at who are the countries who are reeling? Its funny how Brazil under the socialist President Lula enjoyed rapid growth, China under the Communist party of China enjoyed rapid growth, but the USA and UK after years of Bush and Blairite "New Labour" ended up bankrupt....hmmmm

To say that President Lula was a socialist and the china is communist is frankly laughable.
Former colleagues of lula were so disullusioned with him in office, they went up and set up their own left-wing parties.
China is an example of state directed capitalism. The public sector over there accounts for 25% of GDP over here it's 50%.

This. When will Labour or Socialist apologise for their mess?

I guess it was the same socalist policies that brought the US into a heap of poo as well?

If only we followed the right wing German way! Then things would be better.

Oh wait...

If you look at spending and deficits. It was coming down right from Thacher until 02. After that spending and the deficit began to rise pretty sharply until 08 when the crisis hit. After 08 spending really shot up with the bank bailout.

Apart from when Major was in power when spending/GDP rose and the deficit rose until '94?

The more important question: do the Tory voters feel guilty for screwing over thousands of students, cutting **** loads of money from public services whilst lining the pockets of the exuberantly rich?

Thanks.

Yeah I feel pretty good the Deficit is being cut down and the private sector is getting the funds to expand.

You realise the reforms to higher education makes the deficit bigger (for the next 20 years anyway) right?

Lula is considerably to the left of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown who are socialists according to this thread.
