I love it when military and politicians who insist on spending cuts and tax breaks for the rich and corporations cries when their cuts result in cuts in military benefits.

Or you said private and public union workers make too much and need to make some sacrafices but now you want to cry that you do too? Waaa!!!!

We told you. It was ok until they came for me, then there was no one left for me to complain to.

What's a Senator make?
What's an E-4 with a wife and two kids make - the active duty one in a combat zone.
You should be ashamed of yourself, you unpatriotic fuck

If you are a Republican, please explain to me how on one hand you think the Senator should take the pay cut and not the E4

But at a private company you are ok when a CEO gives himself a $20 million dollar bonus after asking hourly workers to pay more for their healthcare.

One more thing. My Congressman busted some serious nuts.

And he's a Democrat. I don't like any of his political ideas, but this guy really worked over the Tricare system to get that cognitive therapy turned on.

I actually got a phone call from a Colonel on the medical review board to offer me his deepest and sincerest apologies after my Congressman get involved.

It was sweeeeeeeeet!

Your Congressman has to respond to a flare sent up by a vet. They all have military affairs staff.

Just so you know.

That's because the military is based on that thar evul soshillism that many murkins, and especially meatheads, abhor and mistakenly think they are fighting to keep murka from being infected.
Had he been an employee at Bobz Garden center, he'd be all alone.......exactly what THEY want.

i am beginning to think warrior is not what he says....since he thinks there is no threat to tricare and it has been all over the news and mailers have gone to military families...etc....but since warrior hasnt heard of it..it must not exist or he is not what he says.....i think he is not a vet nor a warrior at all.

What fucking "mailer" are you speaking of?

I don't really give a fuck if you thing\k I am a vet or not.

It's obvious you're not

I thought it was just me, but I have met a lot of other military retirees who feel the same way I do about having served for 20 years, which is to say we feel like the world's biggest suckers.

The promises that were made to us are being broken. The "free medical" is not free. If you don't live near a VA hospital, you enroll in Tricare. And Tricare has insurance premiums just like any other health insurance. Sure, it is currently cheaper than a civilian health insurance plan, but there is a movement underway in Congress right now to triple our premiums, and that would demolish any cost advantage to serving 20 of the youngest years of your adult life for medical benefits.

They are also going to do away with the military pension. The reasoning at first sounds logical. A guy who serves four years of active duty who gets sent to combat does not get any kind of retirement plan. A guy who serves 20 years who never went to combat gets a paycheck for the rest of his life.

So the idea is to create a kind of 401-k plan. If you serve only four years, you have a little nest egg when you get out.

But think about that for a minute.

You join the service and after 20 years you get a health benefit identical to a civilian's health benefit. Except you get shot at. And you get paid less.

You join the service and you get a 401-k, just like a civilian. Except you get shot at, and you are paid less.

Why would I join the military?

Oh. Yeah. Patriotism.

Sure.

Ever hear of Tricare Standard or the Thrift Savings Plan? Both have been around for at least 15 years.
