Please do not attempt your half-witted slang language, as you fail at it fantastically.

You embarrassed yourself by saying 'you mad bro'. I can imagine you saying it in a posh accent as well. But i guess you're only trying to fit in with your other EDL pals.

I understand, but I'm talking more about the Anjem Choudary types and the types who are ideologically like but aren't publicity whores. It's one thing now that they're just about 5,000 or so, but imagine in 20 years time, when they've raised kids and made proselytes to their Wahhabist creed, both among the Muslim community and the prisoners/social outcaste non-Muslims who they target; they could well be 50,000 or more. This seems to be what the EDL means to target, but the fact that many of them really don't know much more about Islamic demographics and sects aside from what comes off of bare naked islam.com and they don't seem to be the most intellectually astute bunch.

As for the other ethnic minorities, I saw some youtube videos of EDL divisions in Eltham protecting their community during the riots over the summer, and from what I understand most of the rioters where black. Also, the EDL has a Sikh division, Jewish division and they had a nice article on their website about Ahmadi Muslims: <a href="http://englishdefenceleague.org/tag/ahmadiyya-muslim/">http://englishdefenceleague.org/tag/ahmadiyya-muslim/</a>

Ah right, will read that. Really? Why do you reckon they dont get as much coverage? They've most likely done something wrong which equates to what we see in the media nowadays about muslims?

Well, on the surface they go about it in a civilised manner, if you google some documentaries on them you'll be able to see that they didn't start out that way! Still, they will never hold enough seats in parliament anyways.

Hmmm no not really. Even with all the anti- Islam propaganda, the majority of people do see through their so- called "party" to the fact that they're a bunch of idiots. You can see from their supporters that the people who support them are as stupid as they are. They're not even "anti- extremism" they're just racists.

Tbh I honestly think the whole Islamic terrorist thing will just fade out in the future. It's just another scapegoat theme- we've had the Jews and Blacks in the past, now Islam, in the next 5 years everyone might be hating on scientologists or something.

But what I think is really important is that people don't rise to the taunts, and don't lower themselves to the other persons level. The only way to fight racism is to be a good example and change people's perceptions <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

No I didn't <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/> And the majority of EDL members probably don;t use internet Memes, as it implies a certain level of nerdieness <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>
