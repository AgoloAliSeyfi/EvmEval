Governments back to work program.

What the coalition failed to mention is the amount of employers out there, who may abuse this program that is being forced onto the unemployed without there express will or legal consent.

This means that you will be placed into a position where if you do not clean streets shovel animal excrement, clean graffiti you will lose your Job Seekers Allowance and only form of income. By being forced to do all of this it can be argued that it is a significant risk to your mental well being and confidence.

Also the employers may continue to abuse this system by making fraudulent promises of employment, even though they will just find another person and start the process over again.

This means that the employer may make thousands if not hundreds of thousands of pounds of money from your free labour while you, are forced to do this to keep your welfare.

It can be argued that this is clearly a psychological way to break you into submission and to become a slave to an undeserving employer, who will only profit and live a life of luxury while you suffer a life of poverty on bennefits.

Imagine if you where forced to do all of this threw no fault of your own and made to suffer
over the actions of a previous government. Dare i even ask what happens to some of these people forced onto this program who supported or still supports labour?

Imagine if i became one of the employers supporting the governments back to work program and i said to you shovel that excrement or i will let your job centre know you wont work. Now imagine you lose your income and are left to starve or end up homeless. Would you ever forgive the coalition for allowing employers like me to abuse programs like that. Even when the money you are making me will allow me to run round in jaguars while i get away with it and you will be forced to run around in worn out cars.

Do you all see the point i have just made. Doesn't take a genius to see how this program could easily encourage abuse of it and possibly escalate our already high unemployment problem.

Okay Gaz So how would you tackle the unemployment problems and deal with this deficit?

Well firstly by freezing Job Seekers Allowance Rates for the next 5 years so they do not under any circumstance increase. That alone will help pay of the debt. Also adding to this i would give those claiming job seekers allowance three options preventing the need for hardship payments allowing more debt to be paid off.

Option 1

Recieve at most £90 per fortnight if they wish to search for work regaurdless of age but do not wish to pursue any training or undergo any work placements. This short but fair ammount will be enough incentive for them to find employment or go into the second option training.

Option 2

Receive the basic rate and be in continuous training or education to keep the basic rate so that there chances of finding work greatly increase. Because of this they will keep the basic rate but will also be working to keep there bennefit.

Option 3

Get basic state rate plus a small amount added such as an extra £30 per fortnight to cover busfares however they will be on constant work trials until they found work. This would greatly boost there chances of finding work

Do you mean debt or deficit (although in fact neither is remotely true, but it would be nice to understand what your made up fact is based on)!!

I hope the remaining 95% is better than the 5% that we've seen so far - are you saving the best until last?

Will there be more made up statistics, or are just going to stick to subjective issues?
