No I didn't. I have been talking about disaster relief moving up from local to state to federal. Each has it's own role. FDNY is city government and they were on site since the planes hit. Federal Government did not have assets or personnel staged in New York and it took them longer to arrive

The Federal Government played a major role in the rebuilding of lower Manattan after 9-11.......we could not have relied on private charities

Actually, I questioned you as to why you feel it is OK for the federal government to offer individuals grants and low interest loans when in a wide spread disaster and not offer the same to individuals who suffer similar losses but not in a widespread event.,

You never answered...you went inmto something about the need to clear roads, re build schools, etc.....things I DIDNZT question.

But when it came to what I questioned?

Nada.

So answer my question. A man who works in a city 30 miles away, loses his ho,e to a tornado that rips uyp the town he lives in. He still has a job becuase the city was unaffected...but he lost his home.

Becuase it was widespread, he gets a low interest loan.

In the meantime, a man who works from hoime loses his home to a fire caused by lightening.

Now he not only lost his home, but he lost his place of business.

But it was not widespread, so he does not get federal assiatnce.

Why si that OK with you?

Why do you hate people that work in their own home?

Personally.....I agree with you and would have no problem with individual homeowners who suffer a catastrophic loss being eligible for low cost loans or tax write-offs. I believe our right wing and Dr Paul would go ballistic though

As to why we differentiate...I did give you a potential rationale

.Good question. It may be a question of magnitude once again. If your house burns down, you still have your job. You still have a community structure around you.

What happens when your entire community is wiped out? Your job is gone, friends and neighbors who would have helped you before, now have their own problems. Is a bank going to help you when you don't even have a job anymore? Is a bank going to invest in a community that has been wiped out? The government will. Those loans not only help you rebuild your house but help your boss rebuild his business, help rebuild schools and bridges and roads

Personally, as a citizen, it makes me feel good to know that my government is there to help people in need. When I see US troops helping OUR people in a disaster area it makes me proud to be an American

In any case, when major disaster strikes, I am happy that the American people are there to help those in need

I love how you progressively can be pushed into conservative or even classical liberal ideas and then the next day you rest yourself like a watch and we do it again...

It's almost like you're a closeted conservative...

FDNY is local government.
You moved the goal posts from Fed to local.

I don't believe most progressives even understand the difference between the state and federal government.

Most are too fucking stupid to hold a job - what makes anyone believe they could rationalize the constitution or even the Bill of Rights.

Progressives are like gigantic babies...

"ma, ma" "government, government"
