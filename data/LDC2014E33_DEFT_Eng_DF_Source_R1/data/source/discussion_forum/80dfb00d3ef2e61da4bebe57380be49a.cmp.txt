Rant of the day? Who's got a better one?

2nd Post from Consrv. Zero issues of OP Addressed. Not like that's surprising.

Although from a complete frikkin' moron like Wiseacre, not sure anyone would EVER expect issues to be addressed. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Of course Soggy is as stupid as Wisacre and I doubt either have ever actually discussed an issue. I'd love to debate either of them on actual issues! But you know, they don't to facts, issues, etc...

OWS has captured the attention and participation of the entire world.
This is indisputible. They have a LOT of very legitimate concerns but
FOX, the RW e-media etc... have enslaved the minds of Conservatives,
much in the way of the book "1984".

Do NOT pay attention to the evidence! WE will tell you what to think.
WE will tell you your opinions.
This has been evidenced in other threads.

So when an Occupier says "We object to the level of influence afforded
Corporations and Special Interest Groups by Citizens United!"
A Conservative will reply as they have been instructed with something
like "You poop on streets!"
Notice how the issue is avoided and the need for Independent thought
is eliminated? Conservatives are simply not equipped to deal with the
ISSUES that OWS has brought up, so they parrot what they have been
taught.
The ISSUES?
* WE DON'T WANT TO END CAPTIALISM, WE want to end the Corporatacracy
and restore our Democratic Republic. For every hour a senator or
congressman spends with a citizen who has a legitimate concern, they
spend over 100 with a lobbyist, CEO or UNION LEADER (Oh Damn, that
eliminates the "Change the Subject Tactic that Conservatives use when
they can't address issues directly!). There is no voice of the people.
Anyone thinking our government is not run by money, is a fool.
* No more bank bailouts. This includes Fannie May and Freddie Mac, btw
(Oh Damn, that eliminates the "Change the Subject Tactic that
Conservatives use when they can't address issues directly!).
* Stop giving money belonging to We the People, away to the corrupt
politicians of foreign governments.
* No more subsidies or tax breaks to any company that doesn't hire
100% American, attribute their income 100% in America and pay their
taxes 100% in America.
* Reverse "Citizen's United" and put elections back in the hands of
The People.
* Repeal Gramm-Leach-Bliley (Like Newt Says!).

Those are just some of the ISSUES. How will Conservatives respond to
the issues? We all know. Dodge, change the subject, Project What they
Have been Instructed to Believe etc... Well
guess what Conservs. The Tea Party didn't promote ending the intereference of
religion in politics. They're overwhelingly old and Conservative. OWS is
overwhelmingly Young and Liberal. So duh. Gee. Go figure. Just a tactic to dodge
the issues they bring up. Replace them with your own.

But Conserv won't address these issues. Their ThoughtMasters have told them
not to...

You and others like you have proven beyond all doubt that it is a waste of time to reply to liberal rants.

The liberals are running (and ruining) this country.

Liberalism is a fucking mental disorder!

Yet another Post from Consrv. Zero issues of OP Addressed. Okay, point made. Conservatives are scared little cowards when it comes to issues. They're scared sh1tless! 20 post, not one has the balls to discuss a single issue. Their ThoughtMasters have forbidden it! So the mindless drones just parrot what they are told to think.

What a bunch a weak little pusses.
