Every time I get the tube into or around London, there's always lots of people on it and I'm always the ethnic minority.

Most of the schools in the areas west of here are now majority immigrant. My friend works in a school where there's an average one white boy in the class. Many of the kids are illiterate. Some of the kids fail on purpose because in their culture, being clever is not seen as a masculine trait. It's a horribly underachieving school, these people will in future years have nothing to contribute to our society.

Immigrants have more children than native, white Brits because it pleases Allah, or because more kids means more workers for the fields, or more rupees in the family pocket and as at least half the kids will die of AIDS, the more they have, the better.

The tube cannot get more packed, the NHS hospitals are over run, there are several hundred applicants to every job and this will only double, triple etc. in future years.

My further point is they come here but never go back to contribute to their own countries, which remain stuck in the Third world.

It's not anything to do with disliking ethnicity, I just think we've been acting detrimentally to our own population for a number of years and it needs to stop.

you mean they don't put in an effort with their studies?

Because a lot of people see britain as their home now! My parents are from Italy and Sardinia and they've been here since their late teens/early twenties and they see britain/england as their home. They don't have a desire to go back and help italy and their economy.

I'm not opposed to immigration.
But I don't particularly like the lack of integration with 'native' society/culture and voluntary segregation of some (and I can't stress enough how I do NOT mean "all") migrants.

what the hell is integration.... isn't it just obeying the laws and respecting your fellow citizen?

there's more to the argument than the people who have succesfully immigrated and the outcome for the country they're immigrating to, there are still people living in terrible conditions in other countries in war and famine who aren't allowed in because they were born there.
