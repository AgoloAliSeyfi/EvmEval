Piffka - with respect may I refer you to the graph posted a couple of pages ago showing that such variation is well within the planetary warming-cooling cycle? We only have temperature changes going back a century or so, and you well know the planet is a lot older. In fact you may wish to look up the relevant pages in an Australian professor's paper
<a href="http://www.lavoisier.com.au/papers/submissions/Foster3">http://www.lavoisier.com.au/papers/submissions/Foster3</a> (2001).pdf
in which he completely debunks the calculation as far as his hemisphere is concerned - you'd think he doesn't want to get drowned any more than the rest of us do.

Blatham - yes I did run the numbers on the 16ft-rise-in-ocean-levels calculation. It does seem that IF all of the west Antarctic ice sheet - both above and below sea level - were to melt, worldwide ocean levels WOULD rise by 5 meters.

The other news is this would take about 3 (three) million years at present rates. Your suggestion relating to Rush is clearly attributable to jealousy that we, too, would get deep-water ports to compete with Halifax, Nova Scotia &lt;G&gt;

Thanks, Helen, I had examined the graph you posted for Greenland. Very interesting. Though you seem to have posted it to emphasize the difference in temperatures between today and the Younger Dryas, what was surprising to me was how little fluctuation was needed for the Little Ice Age.

I posted the NOAA graph to show there does seem to be a definite global trend. What I have seen it that it is hard to find world-wide information with a long view -- most of the time it is for a short time period or for a specific region.

Thank you for pointing me Foster. He appears to be putting a lot more sarcasm in his scientific papers than is needed. It does take the professionalism out of his work, imho. I intend to keep reading despite his pugnacious attitude. I am surprised, however, that in the beginning of his abstract he says:

This seems clearly disputed by the NOAA measurements as shown on the graph I posted. Frankly, with scientists all over the board on this question, it is not surprising that people are concerned and become sceptical when faced with the extraordinary variety of conclusions. All those countries that have signed the Kyoto Protocol must be convinced of something.

My concern is that there has been a pattern of denial, often with little scientific support on one side. It has gone something like this:

First, there was an effort to say that no warming existed at all.
Then, that there wasn't a significant increase in greenhouse gases.
Then, that the warming was natural and that greenhouse gases weren't causing the change, and also that "warmth is better."*
Then, that there was nothing economically that we could do about the greenhouse gases.
Also, that agreements to limit greenhouse gases were not fair.
Somewhere in there, we start hearing there is no possibility of abrupt climate change.
These denials are interspersed with charges that any concern is politically based, full of misinformation and obvious journalistic hysteria.
Also, there are hints that these concerns are from scientists who only want to fund their own pet projects.
Finally, there are calls from some scientists that they can't get funding for what they consider to be important steps in studying the question.

&lt;shrug&gt; What's a person to do?
