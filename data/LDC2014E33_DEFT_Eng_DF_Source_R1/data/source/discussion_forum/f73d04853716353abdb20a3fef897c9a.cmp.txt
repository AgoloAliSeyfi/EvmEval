@High Seas,

I occasionally vote Republican. I highly doubt I will vote for the Republican presidential candidate this time, but our esteemed moderators have made it clear that this is to be a discussion re: the prospects. That's something I'm very interested in.

You made an assertion about "real" candidates not on the list -- the natural follow-up question was OK, who are those real candidates not on the list? That you refuse to answer that question is odd, but whatever.

@High Seas,

While taking Patraeus out of the race in 2012 may have been a happy side benefit for Obama, he wanted and needed him in Afghanistan first and foremost.

I really don't know how the thumbs work, and don't bother with them. Does thumbing a post down hide it from anyone other than the "thumber?" I should hope not.

Ignore works just fine for the one remora who swims these waters.

The CPAC conventions attract thousands of conservatives from many other groups. This year, 14 people on the "A2K List of Candidates" have been invited to speak according to the CPAC website and 9 have accepted. Huckabee and Palin have not yet agreed to appear, according to the update I saw today.
Again, the CPAC thing is in DC Feb 10th-12th.
RealClearPolitics (RCP) has an article posted today that starts with this:
"President Obama created a stir last week when he reiterated that while he doesn't support gay marriage, he still struggles with the issue. He said his views are 'constantly evolving."
The gist of the RCP article is that the DADT repeal could foreshadow a deeper GOP generational shift on a number of issues, mostly in the social arena.
The article goes on to say that several conservative groups will not be attending CPAC because the likes of the Log Cabin Republicans and GOProud (advocates of gay rights) will be there.

Which brings me, as one of the moderators here, to this question for a new list beyond "Names." Let's call it "Issues."
What do you see as the defining issues in the race for the Republican nomination? I would suggest that "the economy" is too broad. It needs to be sub-divided, perhaps.
If we get any responses, we are hiring here. Anyone who is interested is invited to keep the list updated.

@realjohnboy,

I'm not sure how far the GOP will get with trying to repeal ObamaCare, but that'll be an interesting issue to watch how they approach it. Once legislation is approved by congress and the president, I'm not sure how they can repeal any parts of it - although they claim they can control the funding end of the program.

@cicerone imposter,

Why not do as Bush did on the drug bill and borrow the money from medicare and social security while reducing the tax "burden" on the rich.

@rabel22,

What other option does Obama have? He hasn't identified how he's going to pay for it - yet. That some still believe "not a dime more" is a mystery of stratospheric proportions.

@realjohnboy,

Very interesting about CPAC RJB. I'm familiar with the Log Cabin Republicans, but this is the firt time I've heard of GOProud. I think you may be onto something about the social issues in terms of a organizational divide.

Issues I think of are usually in terms of the larger general election. If I was to specifically think of which issues will effect the Republican nomination, it would be as follows (in no order).

Afghanistan (and lesser so on Iraq) - The GOP needs to form a plan on how to get out of this situation. It's too late to really sell the idea that we need to be there forever. I think positive points will go to candidates that at least sound like they have a clear idea how to get out. This will also help in the general election with independents and moderate democrats.

Same Sex Marriage - The GOP will have to decide if they can continue to court the religious conservatives on this. The end of DADT socially sets the national tone and path towards recognizing homosexuals equally. I'd say within the GOP this is still something they will oppose, but maybe with less vigor than in the past.

Oil Drilling - I think issues like off shore drilling and drilling in ANWR still unite most Republicans. It also sets them apart from the dems pretty well. I'd also tie this in with the larger issue of natural resources. I think it's likely that succesful GOP candidates will push ideas like "clean coal" and natural gas.

That's all for now
