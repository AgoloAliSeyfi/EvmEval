Not sure why this just popped into my head but i though i'd share.

About six months ago my wife and eldest daughter went out for the evening leaving me at home with my two young boys. I'd arranged an evening in with some friends so my dad came round to watch a dvd upstairs with my boys.

I'd already put the boys in bed with a DVD when my dad turned up so he poured himself a cider and stood chatting with me and my friends for ten minutes before heading upstairs to see the kids.

Me and my pals got on with playing cards and having a drink and about an hour later my dad came downstairs to say that the boys were asleep and he was heading off. He reached for his half empty glass of cider and took a glug. All of a sudden his face turned bright red, his eyes started watering, he was coughing and gasping for water.

One of my mates, thinking that the glass was mine, had smeared ghost chilli extract around the rim of the glass when i'd popped to the toilet.

Thankfully the old man saw the funny side.

Has anyone else got any practical joke related tales?

that was brilliant. I found a chocolate bar at work in fridge, told one of the lads it was mine and said he could have it. I then took a picture of him eating it and emailed it round and said he has stole it as a joke. Recpetionist started crying- it was a chocolate bar for her mum who was in hospital.

I can remember years ago making a rather convincing guy fawkes complete with balaclava. Being a few weeks before bonfire night I decided to hide it in my mums wardrobe so it would jump out on her when she opened the door.

She nearly had a heart attack and grounded me for a week.
