Idiot...he is pointing out cyberspace can do more for us without huge damage like ICBMs.

But of course, you figured he meant to get rid of ICBMs because cyberspace is a new tool. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

ICBMs are the our last line of defense for this country along with bombers and SLBMs....so they will be used last, but if you idiots get rid of them then there is no last line of defense. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_whistle.gif"/>

A REAL quote from General Kahler, not from the confounded mind reader, who is SURE he knows what Kahler is thinking:

And the military command in charge of a cyberattack now believes its legally in the clear to conduct offensive operations of any kind, Air Force Gen. Robert Kehler, its chief, told Reuters. If there is an Israeli attack on Iran, U.S. military planners will probably be taking notes.
****************************************
CYBER attack capability is what the US wants, and needs. That is why Kehler speaks of SPACE &amp; TECHNOLOGY, not the outdated ICBM's. Disarming the opponent by computers is at the forefront of nuclear technology in THIS century, and millenium.

Uh, Reagan got rid of old ICBM systems because we had the MMIII in place. The MMIIIs are being upgraded and there is no alternative to them.....idiot.

Some are outdated, some redundant. I doubt those opposed to cuts understand how many we have.

That's what he did with the START Treaty - he got several other countries to give up live weapons while we gave only outdated and unusable weapons.

I read this on couple of news sites. We don't rely on nuclear weapons and we can, at this time, kill other countries something like 700 times over. So we get rid of some older weapons and can only kill other countries 400 times over. So what.

This is the kind of the thing the rw's just LOVE to go off half cocked about. I'll bet the email lies are flying back and forth. First rule - don't confuse them with facts.

Funniest part of this is that this is what Reagan tried to do. LOL

You are just a nut and a dumb one too, on the internet talking to someone that briefed Gen Kehler numerous times.....he came into my office one morning and warned me about eating Burger King food for breakfast.

It is clear you know little about nuclear weapons. SLBM means SEA LAUNCHED ballistic missiles. That and cruise missiles are our primary defense sources. Even in 1981, a negotiator at the original SALT talks told my class "We have cruise missiles that could hit the men's room of the Kremlin". The man's name is Albert Carnesale. He knew quite a bit about the subject; if you know ANYTHING about the history of nuclear weapons, you have heard of him.

That's nice; those who go by the name GONE"BEZERK" obviously think about the mental health of others. Did you discuss ICBM's in cyberspace with the General, or did the nice men in white coats put the cloth restraints back on?

Obamination said he hopes to get rid of all nukes someday.

That is the plan....to slowly get rid of them. He lowered the numbers soon as getting into office and wa-laa he now wants more cuts.....huge cuts. Shocking..... <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

Little girl, you spell his name wrong.

Your crackhead is busy looking up stuff on wikipedia to try to keep up with me with your made up stuff too. I worked in this world for years before moving on to new things that are even more cutting edge and on the news than this....
