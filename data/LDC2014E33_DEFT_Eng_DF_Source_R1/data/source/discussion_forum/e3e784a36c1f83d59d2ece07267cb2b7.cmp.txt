How can you Republicans think you have a chance this November?

Because nit-twits like you think the voting public will digest liberal illogic/lies, hook, line, and sinker.
P.S. -Also, get back to us on gas prices come September. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Look at you righties and your treasonist thoughts. I know we are in an election year but you treasonist bastards have admitted that your number one priority is to make Obama a one term president, and so it is very obvious to anyone with a brain that the GOP have been sabotaging the recovery. That is why their approval numbers are at 8% and Obama's approval numbers are growing. Now you admit the corporations that rule our nation are going to play politics with Iran and Oil Prices? And we are going to put Romney or Santorum in office because the rich own our government? Wasn't it Bush that put Alito and Roberts in the Supreme Court? We can't afford to go any more to the right buddy. The right have thrown women onto the list of people they have offended? This is going to be fun. Gas. Obama will handle that just like he handles everything else. With class.

I am not kidding here you scum. I think you righties are fucking horrible people. Hoping gas prices go up? And then you say corporations aren't corrupt? LOL.

If we were in another civil war, I'd have no problem going to war with Americans like you.

Socialist/Progressive wankers moving the goal posts i see? The man apologized. Case closed. Move on weirdos.

I never said Rush should apologize.

He has a first amendment right to say whatever he wants. No matter how ugly or assinine.

My complaint is that the GOP let itself get suckered into this trap. Which I guess is inevitable when you have a political strategy based on playing on people's religion to get them to vote against their own economic interests, sometimes you have to pretend you care about the silly religious shit.

He does not have the righ to slander a private citizen.

Does Rush do much BUT slander?

With Americans like you, I'd first try to go through our failing political system, before I'd take up arms against you.
But that is because I know first hand that most of us Americans have more in common (freedom, liberty, justice), then less in common; when all is said and done outside of our claustrophobic two-party corporatist plutocracy.
War not good.........................but if it becomes a last resort, well???????????

I talked to one of my Republican friends today, and she said her 18 year old daughter got pregnant because she didn't have enough money to pay for birth control.

And she's a REPUBLICAN.

These are real life issues that women understand better than men.

Seriously, Chris....you have a conversation with republicans about every issue you post on. Do you realize just how foolish you sound? I really doubt any republican in their right mind would take you serious enough to carry a conversation with you. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_eh.gif"/>

Republican or Democrat, any girl not smart enough to get BC from Planned Parenthood DESERVES the consequences of her STUPIDITY. My God, this issue is NOT about access to birth control, you can get it almost ANYWHERE for FREE!!

This issue is about forcing unwilling people to PAY for it, one fucking way or another!
