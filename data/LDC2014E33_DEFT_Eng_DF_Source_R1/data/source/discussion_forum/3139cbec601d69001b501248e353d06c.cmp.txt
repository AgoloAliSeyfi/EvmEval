Meanwhile, out in the real world, this might be the kind of thing that the Treaty would actually be meant to tackle:

The U.S. government has lost track of over 200,000 machine guns that were supposed to be used by the Iraqi police, according to a prominent human rights watchdog calling for tougher international regulations on arms dealings.

The 99-ton cache of AK47s was to have been secretly flown to Iraq in 2004 from a U.S. base in Bosnia, but there is no proof that the four plane loads of arms ever arrived, said Amnesty International in a report released last week.

According to the report titled "Dead on Time," private arms brokers working for the Pentagon clandestinely shipped hundreds of thousands of weapons and tens of millions of rounds of ammunition from Bosnia to Iraq between July 2004 and June 2005. During those shipments, at least 200,000 Kalashnikovs went missing after passing through the hands of private contractors from a half dozen countries.

"The principal U.S. contracting firm had to use a broker in Croatia that was not known to the Croatian government," said Amnesty's arms control expert Bryan Wood. "They then used a freight forwarding agent in Bulgaria. They contracted a cargo company that had broken the UN embargo on Liberia and also flew an aircraft out that didn't have air operating authorization."

Reached by telephone, officials at the Pentagon would not comment for this story. [..]

According to the humanitarian group Oxfam International, there are currently no global standards for governments' regulation of arms exports and no international requirements for governments to link guns to their location--whether military stockpile, police depot, or civilian home.

This is an especially big problem, says Oxfam, because 12 billion bullets are produced every year--enough to kill everyone in the world twice. [..]

They and other human rights groups have pinned some of their hopes for tougher regulations on a United Nations Summit scheduled to begin June 26th in New York.

Oxfam lobbyist Greg Puley told OneWorld that the 2006 UN Small Arms Review conference will help usher in a new level of agreement "on basic principles--such as you don't sell weapons to people who will use them to commit human rights abuses or other atrocities."

Puley said the European Union--along with a host of African, Asian, and Latin American nations--have already endorsed this position. The Chinese government's position is unknown. The Bush Administration, he said, "hasn't blocked progress."

"It's certainly in their interest," Puley added, "to stop people from selling arms to people who plan to use them for terrorist acts."

There is nothing about making weapons illegal for civilians in this treaty because that is not the point of this one. This one is just designed to make it easier to track down people's weapons.

Only after they get enough tools in place to track down all the guns will they start pushing treaties that make guns illegal for civilians.

oh? Point to the part of the treaty that makes it easier to track down who owns guns?
</quote>

Articles 7 and 8 (which replicate the decentralized gun registration system that was set up here in 1968).

</quote>
So you don't want to enforce US laws then? The treaty doesn't create anything not already in existence in US law.

Laws concerning the ILLEGAL transfer of weapons hardly make it easier to track down weapons owned legally.

Yes they do.

Since the laws already exist in the US and have since 1968, your fear of losing your weapon has obviously been realized, right?. Your fears have proven correct, haven't they? When did you lose your guns? Or is 38 years not long enough to get over your paranoia?

Don't be a bigot.

So, when did you lose your guns? There is nothing in the treaty that is not already US law. Yet you haven't lost your guns under US law.

When the treaty to take your guns away comes along then you can complain about treaties wanting to take your guns away. Until then you are acting paranoid and demanding we ignore US laws.
