Makes sense to me .\n\n< / quote> \n\nThose are n't superficial reasons . Gingrich is not a leader , at least not of the most important country on earth . The people whom he led in the past do n't want him now , and his temperament is not suited to the Presidency .\n\nSorry .\n\n< / quote> \n\nGiven those people were a large part of the problem , and could n't wait to get back to making deals with the other side , not seeing their objections as being the problem .\n\nI look at the results - Balanced budgets ( kind of ) , welfare reform and serious changes in the way Congress did business .\n\nBut , heck , no , we do n't want any real reform . We want a guy who is going to cut more deals with the special interests , because that 's worked so well for the country .\n\n< / quote> \n\nSure , I like Gingrich . He 's a very smart man . He did some good things in office so we have to give credit where credit is due . I even considered supporting him .

I wish Paul was a little bit more articulate and less frenetic in his responses . He definitely offers the most substance in his replies , but a lot gets lost in translation .

He has been married 3 times , currently for 13 years to Calista , and I respect the fact that , in spite of political consequences , he has been divorced 2 times , rather than having a sting of lovers , while married to one woman , as so many other politicians try to get away with . I like Newt because I trust Newt . He is the least PC of them all , thus far , and in my opinion .\n\nJustin Quinn : \" Gingrich has been married three times , and he has been accused of having a multitude of extramarital affairs , although he has only admitted to one -- with the woman who would eventually become his third and present wife . \" \nSource : Justin Quinn . \" A Profile of Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich . \" USConservatives . about . com .\n\n< / quote> \n\nNewt has been neither forthright or accurate . The constant stream of Pinocchios he has gotten from the Washington Post , on easily checked facts , demonstrates this .\n\nNot that it will matter to the wingnuts who rely more on truthiness than truth .\n< / post> \n",
